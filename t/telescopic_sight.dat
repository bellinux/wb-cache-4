5|$|T-26 model 1938: new conical turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of fuel tanks. Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a vertically stabilized TOP-1 <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> (or a TOS <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> on the 1938 model).|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> attached. The court heard that the <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|The <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> on the M6 {{and both}} {{elevation}} and traverse controls were {{located on the}} left side, so one gunner was able to aim the gun. The traverse gear had a release mechanism which allowed free movement of the barrel in case a quick traverse was needed.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} Mark III sniper rifles are {{identified}} by different <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights.</b> Five hundred rifles were fitted with 5.2× Warner & Swasey Company Model 1913 prismatic <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> manufactured in Cleveland, Ohio. Serial numbers for rifles manufactured in 1915 have a FK prefix; while those manufactured in 1917 have a LU prefix. Another 907 rifles were fitted with Winchester Repeating Arms Company A5 <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights.</b> Both <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> were mounted offset so the iron sights were usable and the rifle {{could still be}} loaded from charging strips.|$|R
50|$|Whitworth rifles were {{equipped}} with either Enfield style <b>sights</b> or <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights.</b> The <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> were more accurate, {{but had a}} reputation for bruising the user's eye due to the rifle's recoil.|$|R

5|$|Stealth is a {{significant}} element of the gameplay; frequent gunfire can alert distant guards, and activated alarms can trigger infinitely-respawning enemies. Therefore, to avoid gunfights with numerous opponents, it is advantageous to eliminate soldiers and security cameras before they spot or hear the player. Certain weapons incorporate suppressor or <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> attachments to aid the player in killing enemies discreetly. There are no health-recovery items in the game, although armour vests can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight.</b> Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1957 by {{instrument}} maker Helmut Schmidt and master instrument maker Helmut Bender. The company started with producing <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> for large German (mail order) hunting equipment sales chains under various brand names and gradually started to produce <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> under their own brand name.Currently (2008) the company is still a family enterprise.|$|R
50|$|Considered {{the higher}} end of Soviet {{military}} side-mount <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights,</b> {{the quality of}} the PSO-1 is higher than most other PSO-style <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights.</b> The PSO-1 has neither a focus adjustment nor a parallax compensation control. Most modern military tactical scopes with lower power fixed magnification such as the ACOG, C79 optical sight or SUSAT (intended for rapid close-intermediate range shots rather than long-range sniping) lack such features as well. Modern fixed magnification military high-end-grade sniper <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> scopes intended for long-range shooting usually offer one or both of these features. The positioning of the scope’s body {{to the left of the}} bore’s center line may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{market for}} {{military}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> intended for military long-range shooting is highly competitive. Several high end optics manufacturers are constantly adapting and improving their <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> to fulfill specific demands of military organizations. Two European {{companies that are}} active this field are Schmidt & Bender and Zeiss/Hensoldt. American companies that are also very active in this field are Nightforce, U.S. Optics Inc. and Leupold. These high end sighting components generally cost €1500 / $2000 or more. Typical options for military <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> are reticle illumination for use under adverse light circumstances and the presentation of scope settings or ballistic relevant environmental measurements data to the operator through the sights ocular.|$|R
5|$|Xigbar's <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> {{was changed}} from a {{crosshair}} and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, {{which is used to}} shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight.</b> The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} select from four {{difficulty}} levels: Walk on the Beach, Combat Op, Suicide Mission, and FUBAR. A player only {{gain access to}} the FUBAR difficulty after completing the game on Suicide Mission. Various new weapons and equipment become available as the game progresses, some dropped by downed enemies. These include several different rifles, handguns, and machine guns. Some offer alternate firing modes, like attaching a suppressor or using a <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight.</b> Players can also acquire and make use of grenade launchers, hand grenades, and turrets. However, the player can only carry two weapons at a time. Supply caches can be found {{in different parts of the}} game, allowing the player to refill their ammo and grenades. Whenever the player successfully shoots an enemy in the head, the game enters a slow-motion mode for a short period of time. The player can also defeat enemies at close range via melee combat. Dying enemies can be executed, which grants the player additional ammo. Hiding behind cover can provide protection and prevents the player from being shot, as well as providing opportunities to blindfire or lean out to shoot enemies.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> lack {{parallax}} compensation {{because they}} can perform very acceptably without this refinement. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> manufacturers adjust these scopes at a distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard factory parallax adjustment distances for hunting <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> are 100 yd or 100 m to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m. Some long range target and military style <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at 300+ yd/m ranges. Scopes for rimfire guns, shotguns, and muzzleloaders that are rarely fired at 100 yd/m+ ranges will have shorter parallax settings, commonly 50 yd/m for rimfire scopes and 100 yd/m for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Scopes for airguns that are commonly used at short ranges are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually {{in the form of}} an adjustable objective, or AO. These may adjust down as far as 3 yd.|$|R
5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight,</b> but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

50|$|Most {{contemporary}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> {{offer the}} first three adjustment controls. The other three are found on <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> that offer a variable magnification, an illuminated reticle and/or parallax compensation. A rather common problem with the elevation and windage adjustment controls is that once smooth working adjustment turrets 'get stuck' over the years. This is generally caused by long term lack of movement in the lubricated turret mechanisms.|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} German Army {{versions of}} the G36 are equipped with a ZF 3×4° dual optical sight that combines a 3× magnified <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight</b> (with the main reticle designed for firing at 200 m and bullet drop compensation markings for: 200, 400, 600 and 800 m crosshairs and a range-finding scale) and an unmagnified reflex sight (calibrated for firing at 100 m) mounted {{on top of the}} <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight.</b> The reflex sight is illuminated by ambient light during the day and uses battery powered illumination for use at night. Electric illumination is activated automatically by a built in photo sensor and can be manually activated to boost the brightness of the reticle in daytime low contrast situations.|$|E

50|$|Wire reticles are {{the oldest}} type of reticles and are {{made out of}} metal wire or thread. They are mounted in an {{optically}} appropriate position in the <b>telescopic</b> <b>sight's</b> tube. Etched reticles are images of the desired reticle layout that are etched on an optic element. This optical element (lens) with the etched reticle is then mounted in the <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> tube as an integrated part of the optics chain of the sight. When backlit through the ocular, a wire reticle will reflect incoming light and not present a fully opaque (black) reticle with high contrast. An etched reticle will stay fully opaque (black) if backlit. Etched reticles are considered by most {{to be a more}} refined solution and offer greater reticle layout flexibility. Because of this, some manufacturers can provide client-designed custom reticles on special order. In the more expensive and high-end contemporary <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights,</b> etched reticles dominate the market. In cheaper <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights,</b> wire reticles are still often mounted to avoid a rather specialized and costly production step.|$|R

50|$|In optical {{instruments}} such as telescopes, microscopes, or in <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> used on small arms and theodolites, the error {{occurs when the}} optics are not precisely focused: the reticle will appear to move {{with respect to the}} object focused on if one moves one's head sideways in front of the eyepiece. Some firearm <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> are equipped with a parallax compensation mechanism which basically consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to project the picture of objects at varying distances and the reticle crosshairs pictures together in exactly the same optical plane. <b>Telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> may have no parallax compensation because they can perform very acceptably without refinement for parallax with the sight being permanently adjusted for the distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard factory parallax adjustment distances for hunting <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> are 100 yd or 100 m to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m. Some target and military style <b>telescopic</b> <b>sights</b> without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges. Scopes for rimfires, shotguns, and muzzleloaders will have shorter parallax settings, commonly 50 yd/m for rimfire scopes and 100 yd/m for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Scopes for airguns are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually {{in the form of an}} adjustable objective, or AO. These may adjust down as far as 3 yards (2.74 m).|$|R
