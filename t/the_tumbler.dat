5|$|The {{interior}} of <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> was an immobile studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> interior. In addition, another version of <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|Mentmore Towers {{was chosen}} from twenty {{different}} locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, {{which gave the}} impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne's parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.|$|E
25|$|In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), several Tumblers are seen. Each {{of these}} {{vehicles}} has <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler's</b> original military camouflage and is stolen from Wayne Enterprises by Bane's gang. <b>The</b> stolen <b>Tumblers</b> {{are used in}} Bane's attempt to control Gotham and are notably seen when the mass of police and criminals are about to battle. One of <b>the</b> <b>Tumblers</b> fires at <b>the</b> crowd of police, only for the Bat to intercept the shot. Three of <b>the</b> <b>Tumblers</b> are destroyed by Batman using the Bat and Selina Kyle using the Batpod.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{rejected}} Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon {{pitched in}} December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer to script Batman Begins. The duo aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being {{the basis of}} the film. The film was primarily shot in the United Kingdom and Chicago, and relied on traditional stunts and scale models with minimal use of computer-generated imagery. Christian Bale starred as Batman, Liam Neeson starred as Ra's al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. Katie Holmes also starred in the movie as Bruce's love interest, Rachel Dawes, a role created for the film. Alfred, the ex-British Army SAS member was played by Michael Caine and Jim Gordon was portrayed by Gary Oldman. A new Batmobile (called <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler)</b> and a more mobile Batsuit were both created specifically for the film. The film begins with the death of Bruce's parents and then explores his decision to leave Gotham and his training under the League of Assassins with Ra's al Ghul, before he rebels against the League and adopts the guise of Batman, recognising that he cannot condone their use of lethal force. The League attempt to attack Gotham using Jonathan Crane's weaponised fear toxin, but Batman is able to defeat their plan, with Ra's being apparently killed when a train he is in crashes during a fight with Batman.|$|E
25|$|In The Dark Knight (2008), <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> {{returns and}} appears {{twice in the}} movie: where Batman captures the Scarecrow and in a chase where it's damaged by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by the Joker that causes a {{terminal}} crash to which Batman ejects from <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> in the Batpod (a motorcycle formed by the front wheels and struts of <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler)</b> {{as part of a}} self-destruct sequence which sees the remainder of the vehicle explode. <b>The</b> <b>Tumbler</b> is also seen in the trailers in a deleted scene, exiting the improvised Batcave.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} piece of equipment in the process is <b>the</b> <b>tumbler.</b> It is constructed of steel or stainless steel and lined with an acid and abrasion resistant material, such as neoprene, polypropylene, and polybutylene. The barrel sizes range from , however the working volume is only 25 to 35% of the total volume. For most plating applications <b>the</b> <b>tumbler</b> is rotated at 60RPM, however it can vary. If the speed is too fast then lumpy deposits will form on the workpieces, but if the speed is too slow then the metal powder will not deposit onto the workpiece.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was an immobile studio set and not actually {{the interior of}} a street-capable version. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> interior. In addition, another version of the car was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the full-sized one. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show it flying across ravines and between buildings. However, a full-size car was used for the waterfall sequence. The scale model scenes were filmed on a massive set built on a stage at Shepperton Studios in England over the course of nine weeks. The full-sized vehicles were driven and filmed on the streets of Chicago. In The Dark Knight, the Batpod ejects from <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler,</b> with the Tumbler's front wheels as the Batpod's wheels; this was rendered using computer-generated imagery when attempts to achieve the separation through practical effects proved impossible.|$|E
25|$|For {{tumbling}} {{of rocks}} as a lapidary technique, a plastic or rubber-lined barrel {{is loaded with}} a consignment of rocks, all of similar or the same hardness, some abrasive grit, and a liquid lubricant. Silicon carbide grit is commonly used, and water is a universal lubricant. The barrel is then placed upon slowly rotating rails so that it rotates. The optimal speed of rotation depends {{on the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>tumbler</b> barrel and materials involved.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled {{speculation that the}} NBA will occasionally fix the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send {{the best player in}} the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used 7 envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record. Some have speculated that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it. Another conspiracy theory suggests that one of the seven envelopes was thrown into <b>the</b> <b>tumbler,</b> causing one of the corners to fold. After the envelopes were mixed, Stern took a deep breath before reaching into <b>the</b> <b>tumbler</b> and picking the envelope with the folded corner. No one has ever explained why all the other teams would go along with the fix. Afterward, the Draft Lottery Format was changed to the current ping-pong ball lottery in a private room with team representatives. However, despite the lack of any evidence, conspiracy theories still persist regarding the annual outcome of the lottery.|$|E
25|$|In Batman Begins (2005), Bruce Wayne {{utilizes}} {{the prototype}} vehicle known as <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> designed by Wayne Enterprises' Applied Sciences Division as a bridging {{vehicle for the}} military. It includes weaponry {{and the ability to}} boost into a rampless jump. The Tumbler's armor is strong enough to break through concrete barriers without sustaining significant damage. Two full-sized driving versions were used in exterior shots while another full-sized model with hydraulic enhancements was used in jump sequences. A further full-sized, functional version carried propane tanks to fuel the rocket blast out of the rear nozzle. A radio controlled, 1/3-scale electric model also performed stunts in the film including the roof-top chase sequence. Six vehicles were built for the production of the film.|$|E
25|$|The action {{takes place}} in Jerome's very untidy and {{neglected}} flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, {{to convince them that}} it will be appropriate for Geain to stay with him for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fiancée. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the job. Before she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F – a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, almost like a pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently – such as serving a drink with <b>the</b> <b>tumbler</b> upside down.|$|E

Inspired by his childhood fear, he {{takes up the}} vigilante identity of [...] "the Batman" [...] and sets up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor. He takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, now run by the unscrupulous William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox allows Bruce access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and a heavily armored car called <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler.</b> Bruce poses as a shallow playboy to allay suspicion.|$|E
500|$|The Oliviers' {{marriage}} was disintegrating {{during the late}} 1950s. While directing Charlton Heston in the 1960 play <b>The</b> <b>Tumbler,</b> Olivier divulged that [...] "Vivien is several thousand miles away, trembling {{on the edge of}} a cliff, even when she's sitting quietly in her own drawing room", at a time when she was threatening suicide. In May 1960 divorce proceedings started; Leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of Olivier's relationship with Plowright. The decree nisi was issued in December 1960, which enabled him to marry Plowright in March 1961. A son, Richard, was born in December 1961; two daughters followed, Tamsin Agnes Margaret—born in January 1963—and Julie-Kate, born in July 1966.|$|E
500|$|The film {{introduces}} {{a vehicle that}} has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed [...] "the Bat". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached {{it as if it}} were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to [...] "fit into the same family" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> and the Batpod. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional lock picking is {{impossible}} due to <b>the</b> <b>tumblers</b> being magnetically operated instead of via a physical {{up and down}} action. Magnetic keys also cannot be reproduced by locksmiths by sight or other [...] "human sensed" [...] information.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more modern}} modular locking mechanisms, however, do not {{directly}} employ <b>the</b> <b>tumblers</b> to lock <b>the</b> shackle. Instead, {{they have a}} plug within the [...] "cylinder" [...] that, with the correct key, turns and allows a mechanism, {{referred to as a}} [...] "locking dog" [...] (such as the ball bearings found in American Lock Company padlocks) to retract from notches cut into the shackle. Padlocks with modular locking mechanisms can often be taken apart to change <b>the</b> <b>tumblers</b> or to service the lock. Modular locking mechanism cylinders frequently employ pin, wafer, and disc tumblers. Padlocks with modular mechanisms are usually automatic, or self-locking (that is, the key is not required to lock the padlock) ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of padlock locking mechanisms: {{integrated}} & modular. Integrated locking mechanisms directly engage the padlock's shackle with <b>the</b> <b>tumblers.</b> Examples of integrated locking mechanisms are rotating disks (found in [...] "Scandinavian" [...] style padlocks where a disk rotated by the key enters a notch cut into the shackle to block it from moving) or lever tumblers (where {{a portion of the}} bolt that secures the shackle enters <b>the</b> <b>tumblers</b> when <b>the</b> correct key is turned in the lock). Padlocks with integrated locking mechanisms are characterized by a design that does not allow disassembly of the padlock. They are usually older than padlocks with modular mechanisms and often require the use of a key to lock.|$|R

500|$|The {{final month}} of {{additional}} content release, December 2015, saw {{the release of}} the Christian Bale Batsuit from The Dark Knight, due to a multitude of fan requests since it was not featured in <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> pack in September 2015; the original Arkham Asylum Batmobile; a fifth [...] "Crime Fighter Challenge Pack", featuring 6 AR combat and predator challenges for all playable characters; a skin for Harley Quinn based on her classic look and the Arkham Knight skin for Red Hood; a Rocksteady-themed Batmobile skin; a [...] skin; and four [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] missions, which see Mad Hatter playing sinister mind-games with Batman, with members of the GCPD caught in the middle; Killer Croc escaping from his maximum security cell and wreaking havoc on a crashed airship; the League of Assassins returning to Gotham City in order to restore Ra's al Ghul's health; and Mister Freeze returning to Gotham City, where the Arkham Knight's militia kidnaps Freeze's wife Nora in exchange for his help capturing Batman. The [...] "Season of Infamy" [...] missions add new areas to the main game, including a new wing at the GCPD and the interior of Elliot General Hospital, new enemies such as assassins from the League of Assassins, and new gameplay mechanics.|$|E
500|$|The film {{introduces}} the Batpod, {{which is a}} recreation of the Batcycle. Production designer Nathan Crowley, who designed <b>the</b> <b>Tumbler</b> for Batman Begins, designed six models (built by special effects supervisor Chris Corbould) {{for use in the}} film's production, because of necessary crash scenes and possible accidents. Crowley built a prototype in Nolan's garage, before six months of safety tests were conducted. The Batpod is steered by shoulder instead of hand, and the rider's arms are protected by sleeve-like shields. The bike has 508-millimeter (20-inch) front and rear tires, and is made to appear as if it is armed with grappling hooks, cannons, and machine guns. The engines are located in the hubs of the wheels, which are set 3feet (1067mm) apart {{on either side of the}} tank. The rider lies belly down on the tank, which can move up and down to dodge any incoming gunfire that Batman may encounter. Stuntman Jean-Pierre Goy doubled for Christian Bale during the riding sequences in The Dark Knight. The Batpod was highly unstable for riding, and Goy was the only stuntman who could manage to balance the bike, even commenting that he had to [...] "nearly un-learn how to ride a motorcycle" [...] to manage riding the Batpod. Bale did insist on doing shots on the Batpod himself, but was prohibited by the team fearing his safety.|$|E
