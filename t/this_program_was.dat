5|$|The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was {{a planned}} {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on the}} F-22 with enhanced thrust vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup. The aircraft was to be solely controlled by thrust vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> halted in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{currently}} {{receive the}} greatest attention {{in regards to}} conservation. Arguably the most successful fauna recovery plan in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery Plan. Initiated in 1968, its main objective was to downlist the Puerto Rican parrot's status from critical to threatened by 2020. Other objectives include the establishment of two separate, effective, wild populations (500 or more individuals for 5 years), the protection of habitat for those populations and the control of predators, parasites and competitors of the species. Currently, the total wild parrot population is estimated at 44 individuals, and 105 birds are in captivity. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> fundamental in raising ecological awareness in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight {{times and}} the American Civil War, the College {{continued}} to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) {{during the summer of}} 1893, but <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. Perhaps one of the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall's preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated. By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, a 173rd Airborne {{battalion}} of around 600 American paratroopers headed to Ukraine to train Ukrainian national guard troops. The training {{took place at}} the Yavoriv training center near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. The 173rd Airborne paratroopers trained the Ukrainians on how to better defend themselves against Russian and rebel artillery and rockets. Training also included securing roads, bridges, and other infrastructure and treating and evacuating casualties. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> known as Fearless Guardian which was congressionally approved under the Global Contingency Security Fund. Under the program, the United States trained three battalions of Ukrainian troops over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, when there were fears of a German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish volunteers, who would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons of explosives were hidden in caches in case the area came under German occupation. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> terminated immediately upon the training of the volunteers, and orders issued for the collection of all equipment and explosives to be returned to the British.|$|E
5|$|Peasants {{and their}} {{supporters}} advocated the notion that each family was supposed to receive at least four hectares of land; in their system, which made note of differences in local traditional, peasants living in wetlands were to be assigned 16 pogoane (approx. eight hectares), those living in plains 14 (approx. seven hectares), inhabitants of hilly areas 11 (between five and six hectares), while people inhabiting the Southern Carpathian areas were supposed to receive eight pogoane (approx. four hectares). <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> instantly rejected by many landowners, and the negotiations were ended through a decision taken by Heliade Rădulescu, when it was again decided that the ultimate resolution was a prerogative of the future Assembly. The failure to address this most significant of the problems faced by Wallachians contributed to weakening support for the revolutionary cause.|$|E

5|$|Since 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have {{commissioned}} {{a new work}} for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> begun {{to add to the}} wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. A number of these commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as Frank Ticheli's An American Elegy, commissioned by the Alpha Iota chapter in memory of the Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 had {{resulted}} in a Russian withdrawal from the Adriatic and the French takeover of the strategic island fortress of Corfu. The Treaty of Schönbrunn with the Austrian Empire in 1809 had further solidified French influence in the area by formalising their control of the Illyrian Provinces on the Eastern shore. To protect these gains, the French and Italian governments had instigated a shipbuilding program in Venice and other Italian ports {{in an effort to}} rebuild their Mediterranean fleet and challenge British hegemony. These efforts were hampered by the poverty of the Italian government and the difficulty that the French Navy had in manning and equipping their ships. As a result, the first ship of the line built in the Adriatic under <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> not launched until 1810 and not completed until early 1812.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>was</b> not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E
