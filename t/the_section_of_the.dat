Other genera are known, but do not persist from the upper section of the formation, and therefore are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus.|$|E
5|$|A railway, the Bristol Port Railway, {{was built}} through the gorge {{on the east}} side from Hotwells to Avonmouth between 1863 and 1865. The Portishead Railway was opened on the west side in 1867. <b>The</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Port Railway between Hotwells and Sneyd Park {{junction}} was closed in 1922, when construction of a major road through the gorge, the Portway, was started. The Portway was opened in 1926. The road is now part of the A4 road, linking Bristol city centre to the M5 motorway, which bypasses the city near Avonmouth.|$|E

The trunkline was partially turned back to local control in 1953, and the business loop designation was removed at that time. <b>The</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roadway in downtown Newberry has carried several different designations {{in addition to the}} original M-28.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the portion}} of the highway between the eastern {{terminus}} and the Muskogee Turnpike, known as the Broken Arrow south loop, was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001.

Unlike <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turnpike built in the early 1990s, this section was expected to displace few residents; the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the right-of-way ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike.|$|E

5|$|East Tilbury, {{which stands}} at {{the western end of}} <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thames known as Lower Hope Reach, was {{fortified}} long before the building of Coalhouse Fort due to its vulnerability to seaborne attackers.

The attack prompted the building of Cooling Castle on Kent's Hoo Peninsula between 1380 and 1385 but there was initially no corresponding move to improve the defences of East Tilbury.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1890s, the CCE struggled unsuccessfully to raise the capital it needed to fund the construction. Whilst it did so it continued to develop its route proposals. In 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. <b>The</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes which raised the necessary money.|$|E
