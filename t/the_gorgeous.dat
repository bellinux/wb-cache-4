5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire {{from the individual}} to society; he feared that the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; <b>the</b> <b>gorgeous</b> but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E

[...] However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system. As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, [...] "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor." ...|$|E

Rodriguez also approves of a production aesthetic that allows instruments to [...] "sparkle" [...] and [...] "breathing space" [...] for his melodies, and rates Harrison's guitar playing as [...] "stellar" [...] throughout.

[...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make you fall head over heels, <b>the</b> <b>gorgeous</b> scenery surely will, as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'."

500|$|The {{final chapter}} begins with {{examples}} of sexual dimorphism, such as [...] "the antlers of the stag, the spurs of the cock... and <b>the</b> <b>gorgeous</b> plumes found in the males of the birds of paradise", with other examples chosen from across the animal kingdom. Darwin's theory of sexual selection is explained; Beddard then states the objection that female birds must be supposed to have [...] "a highly-developed aesthetic sense" [...] to choose between similar-looking males, and worse, that females of closely related species must have [...] "immense" [...] different tastes. He concludes, though, that the question cannot be answered by what we consider improbable, but requires [...] "actual observation". He calls Poulton's arguments for sexual selection [...] "very ingenious", but writes that Wallace's two different (non-selective) explanations [...] "might both be accepted". He concludes that [...] "it {{is quite possible that}} sexual selection may have played a subordinate part" [...] in producing sexually dimorphic coloration.|$|E

She also thought all of the record's tracks [...] "represent the best of Miguel" [...] and noted the Romance medleys [...] "best {{illustrate}} why Miguel is the top-selling pop singer in Latin America". Richard Torres of Newsday wrote a positive review of the record noting Miguel's vocals are [...] "deeper and gruffer than on his studio albums" [...] which he felt gives the uptempo songs [...] "a deeper, funkier edge". He praised Miguel's ballads [...] "sublime", the bolero medleys, and the mariachi songs, concluding: [...] "Miguel's the best purveyor of love songs around, and Vivo captures the best at his best." ...|$|E

[...] Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network declared Mika as [...] "the worst Street Fighter character," [...] reasoning [...] "every little detail about her annoyed me, from the stupid boob-hearts on her costume to the way she whomped opponents with her butt—and rubbed it after she hit the ground." [...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can say that I have nothing against, er, voluptuous women in games. Or even scantily-clad women", and that [...] "My problem has always been women characters whom I'm expected to take seriously while they slay dragons/wander the desert/travel the frozen wastes while baring their midriff through the majority of their journey", and that she enjoys Mika's [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "goofy" [...] design.|$|E
500|$|... "Why I Love You" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics.

[...] Rob Harvilla of Spin commented that [...] "Why I Love You" [...] closes out the album proper with a monster Cassius-lifted chorus." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that the song is [...] "pure pop aggrandisement", musing that [...] "this rather enjoyable piece of maximalism feels quite at home on an album writ so large, both in sound and verse, that a planetarium was deemed the only fitting venue for its first playback." [...] Craig Jenkins of Prefix wrote that [...] "Mike Dean's titanic, Cassius-sampling [...] "Why I Love You" [...] slowly peels layers off its stuffy largess to reveal <b>the</b> <b>gorgeous</b> string accompaniment underfoot. Kanye and his team are still trafficking in proggy, kitchen-sink experimentation, and Kanye's transformation into rap's own ELO is nearly complete." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson was less enthusiastic about the track, writing that [...] "Everything falls apart on the album-closing [...] "Why I Love You," [...] which cranks up West's love of prog-rock bombast {{so much that it}} sounds like guest crooner Mr Hudson is trying to sing the hook over a poorly recorded bootleg of a Muse concert." ...|$|E
