Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.|$|E

In 1974, with the help of friends Tim Smith and Peter Copeland, he revised a list of the series episodes {{supplied}} by the BBC, and his own earlier research, into a [...] "much more complete typewritten list". He then sent it to Robson Books, who showed an interest. While writing the accompanying text he was [...] "approached by the late Jimmy Grafton, who had been involved with the Goons in their early days, and had helped to get the show on the air. He suggested combining his memoirs with my book, and this is what happened, with the book being published in 1976 under the title The Goon Show Companion."Wilmut was then signed by the agent Roger Hancock, who then commissioned him to [...] "write a similar book about Tony Hancock", his elder brother. The result was 1978s Tony Hancock - Artiste, the book for which he conducted his first interviews. Whilst considering a book on Monty Pythons Flying Circus, Roger Hancock suggested that he cover [...] "the entire generation of comedy which arose from Oxford and Cambridge Universities after 1961". The result was From Fringe to Flying Circus. It wasnt until 1985 that Wilmuts next book appeared, a history of theatrical variety, titled Kindly Leave The Stage. Over seventy people were interviewed for the project, with Wilmut remarking he thought he [...] "ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> as soon as possible in view of the age of the people involved."In 1989 he produced Didnt You Kill My Mother-in-Law?, a history of British alternative comedy. The book was originally the idea of Peter Rosengard, a life insurance salesman who had helped start this comedy movement by opening The Comedy Store in London in 1979. Like Jimmy Grafton with The Goon Show Companion, the book was part memoir (this time Rosengards), and part history of the subject by Wilmut.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} chronic diseases puts a high {{burden on the}} health care systems of Low and Middle Income Countries which are often not adapted to provide the care needed. Peer support programmes are promoted to address health system constraints. This case study analyses a peer educator diabetes programme in Cambodia, MoPoTsyo, from a health system’s perspective. Which strategies were used and how did these strategies change? How is the programme perceived? Methods: Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with patients, MoPoTsyo staff and peer educators, contracted pharmacy staff and health workers, health care workers and non-contracted pharmacists and managers and policy makers at district, provincial and national level. Four areas were purposively selected <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews.</b> An inductive content analysis was done independently by two researchers. Results: MoPoTsyo developed into three stages: a focus on diabetes self-management; a widening scope to ensure affordable medicines and access to other health care services; and aiming for sustainability through more integration with the Cambodian public system and further upscaling. All respondents acknowledged the peer educators’ role and competence in patient education, but their ideas about additional tasks and their place in the system differed. Indirectly involved stakeholders and district managers emphasized the particular roles and responsibilities of all actors in the system and the particular role of the peer educator in the community. MoPoTsyo’s diagnostics and laboratory services were perceived as useful, especially by patients and project staff. Respondents were positive about the revolving drug fund, but expressed concerns about its integration into the government system. The degree of collaboration between health care staff and peer educators varied. Conclusion: MoPoTsyo responds to the needs of people with diabetes in Cambodia. Key success factors were: consistent focus on and involvement of the target group, backed up by a strong organisation; simultaneous reduction of other barriers to care; and the ongoing maintenance of relations at all levels within the health system. Despite resistance, MoPoTsyo has established a more balanced relationship between patients and health service providers, empowering patients to self-manage and access services that meet their needs.

40|$|This {{research}} gives a {{start for}} {{an action plan}} {{on how to do}} research about visual literacy in a developing country as well as on how to use semiotics as a research instrument. Nevertheless, it also shows that without knowledge about cultural conventions of the other, this is not possible. Learning from the other, or in other words, literacy of the researcher when it comes to designing education material for the intended audience, is essential. Visual education material is very common for patient education, especially in developing countries where illiteracy often is a serious problem. In this research, visual education material will be studied from the perspective of visual literacy. According to Messaris and Moriarty (2005) visual literacy is defined in terms of two constant components, first, the ability to understand visual images, and second, the ability to create or use images as means of expression and communication. To understand visual images, the materials should be made according to the cultural and visual conventions of the intended audience. Therefore, the job of a designer is to listen and observe before presenting draft messages to the intended audience; this {{needs to be done in}} order to validate if they conform to their needs and customs (Zimmer & Zimmer, 1978; and Mody 1991). According to Finan (2002) semiotics will justify a higher profile in the design of health education material. To gain more insights about the intended audience of a medical clinic in Nueva Santa Rosa, Guatemala semiotics is used as a research instrument. Based on the research of Cook (1981) about the visual literacy of people in Papua New Guinea, a picture story was designed in order to form a topic list to overcome possible language barriers by letting the research participants perform certain tasks with the picture story to collect information. Kress and Van Leeuwen (2006) say that even though social semiotics is not a ‘universal’ grammar, western culture is a dominant culture and in many parts of the world, Western communication exists side by side with local forms. This is the case in Guatemala, perhaps because of the Spanish colonization and/or the immense influence of the United States. The message itself, that they had to clean their hands before certain acts while cooking, was more than clear to the audience. This suggests that washing hands is part of already existing knowledge, even though the tools and equipment of the kitchen were not always a realistic reflection of reality. To make sure the kitchen reflects the reality of the women coming to the clinic, it is important to take photos of several kitchens in the houses of the intended audience. In that case the designer has a better idea of what tools and equipment are being used and how the kitchens look like. This furthermore reduces the influence of the designers’ own interpretation while designing the visual education material, a factor that could, as this research shows, easily lead to misinterpretations and miscommunication. Cultural differences influenced this research. On the one hand, the photos that were being used to design the visual education material were selected by the designer. This left too much room for the designer’s own interpretation and influence. And on the other hand, it was difficult to get straight-forward answers from the Guatemalan research participants since people are very polite and do not always say what they honestly think. This was especially prominent when asking for someone’s opinion. This difficulty could also have to do with cultural differences. For example, the case might be that the people in Guatemala communicate in a different kind of way than Dutch people do when they want to know someone’s opinion. This shows that to speak about visual literacy, it is essential that the researcher is highly literate when it comes to knowledge about the intended audience in another culture. Based on this research the following suggestions have been made: •	Before designing the visual education material it is important to get to know the intended audience and to learn from the other. Listen, observe and experience. •	In order to design a realistic reflection of the intended audience’s reality, it is also useful to take photos while visiting the houses of the intended audience. These photos should form the basis on which the visual education material are to be designed. •	The designer can then create a draft version of education material and present it to the intended audience to validate whether it conforms to their needs and customs. •	To get valid and in-depth answers of the research participants, it is useful to instruct a native speaker <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>interviews</b> for the researcher him/herself. This way cultural differences that could have otherwise influenced the research can be avoided and they usually know better strategies how to get valid and in-depth answers...|$|E
