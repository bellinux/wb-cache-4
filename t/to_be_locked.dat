5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber for two or more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E

25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} hammer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the hammer completely covered by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|E

25|$|Emmett J. Roe, {{owner of}} Imperial Foods Products Inc.; his son Brad, who was {{operations}} {{manager for the}} company; and plant manager James N. Hair surrendered on March 13, 1992, and were charged with non-negligent manslaughter. There was no trial. On September 15, 1992, owner Emmett Roe pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involuntary manslaughter. No one else was found guilty. Emmett Roe had personally ordered the doors <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> from the outside. He received a prison sentence of 19 years and 11 months. The sentence was unpopular among many of the workers and their families who {{point out that it}} amounts to less than a year for each dead person.

25|$|In {{the third}} part, Price {{is forced to}} be {{inactive}} again, to see if Crawford is worthy of her or not; at the same time, Price knows she can best serve the Bertrams by refusing to marry Crawford despite their pressure on her to give in. When Price does become active again when she loses interest in her needlework to allow her eyes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> with Crawford’s, she nearly loses Edmund who is convinced she does not love him. When Crawford comes to court Price at Portsmouth, despite being impressed {{to a certain extent}} by him, by remaining inactive, she demands of Crawford more perseverance and moral commitment than he is capable of, which causes the superficial Crawford to soon lose interest in her. And in this way, Price marries Edmund and upholds the values which she cherishes.|$|E
25|$|The play proper resumes with Saul (the play {{does not}} include his {{renaming}} as Paul), now dressed as a disciple of Jesus, delivering to the audience a rather lengthy sermon on the Seven Deadly Sins. Saul is taken to Caypha and Anna, who order {{the gates of the}} city <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> that they might kill him shortly. However, an angel appears and tells Saul that he will not die yet, and that a place for him in heaven is assured. Saul's escape from the city in a basket is described, not staged. The play ends with Poeta inviting the audience to sing the hymn Exultet caelum laudibus. While Scherb praises the swift ending and finds its reliance on words rather than images appropriate to the play's thematic focus on faith and the movement from iconography to rhetoric, Coldewey simply finds it abrupt.|$|E
25|$|The low {{probability}} of the 4f electrons existing at the outer {{region of the}} atom or ion permits little effective overlap between the orbitals of a lanthanide ion and any binding ligand. Thus lanthanide complexes typically {{have little or no}} covalent character and are not influenced by orbital geometries. The lack of orbital interaction also means that varying the metal typically has little effect on the complex (other than size), especially when compared to transition metals. Complexes are held together by weaker electrostatic forces which are omni-directional and thus the ligands alone dictate the symmetry and coordination of complexes. Steric factors therefore dominate, with coordinative saturation of the metal being balanced against inter-ligand repulsion. This results in a diverse range of coordination geometries, many of which are irregular, and also manifests itself in the highly fluxional nature of the complexes. As there is no energetic reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> into a single geometry, rapid intramolecular and intermolecular ligand exchange will take place. This typically results in complexes that rapidly fluctuate between all possible configurations.|$|E
