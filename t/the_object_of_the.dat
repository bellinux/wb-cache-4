5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution. However, if <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E

40|$|When a {{data set}} {{contains}} <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> multiple types, to cluster <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> one type, {{it is often}} necessary to consider the cluster structure on <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other types. Co-clustering <b>the</b> related <b>objects</b> often generates better clusters. One basic connection here is that <b>the</b> similarity among <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> one type is often affected by the cluster structures on <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other types. Although many co-clustering schemes have been proposed, none has explicitly explored such a connection. We propose a framework that utilizes this connection directly. In this framework, employing a spectral-embeddingbased approach, we first obtain certain approximate cluster information about <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> individual types. Such information is then used to refine the similarity measures for <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> related types. The final clustering is performed with the refined similarity. We tested our framework on both bipartite-graph and document clustering. Our experiments showed that the refined similarity leads to much better clustering, indicating that our refinement makes the similarity measures closer to their true values. ...|$|R

5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E

Up to four ships can be maneuvered at a time. <b>The</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mode is to prevent the enemy ones from reaching the Great Fox. It also allows players to fire missiles from the Great Fox that they have picked up from exploring in this mode, or from meeting certain conditions in the battle mode (usually destroying all enemies). When a craft that {{is controlled by the}} player encounters an enemy group or missile in this mode, the gameplay switches to the battle mode.|$|E

The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E
