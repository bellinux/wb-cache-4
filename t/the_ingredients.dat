5|$|Cooking styles vary {{by region}} and {{each type of}} cooking style and <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> used are {{generally}} based on the climate and location of the particular region and on traditions.

The Gaza cuisine is {{a variation of the}} Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too.
