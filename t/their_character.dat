5|$|The Character Creation {{section of}} the game was refined to take less time than Fallout 3, with players able to skip the {{tutorials}} and proceed across the Wasteland once <b>their</b> <b>character</b> is set up. The option to make any last minute changes to <b>their</b> <b>character</b> occurs when the player steps {{beyond the boundaries of}} the starting location of Goodsprings.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit <b>their</b> <b>character</b> rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play <b>their</b> <b>character.</b> PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, Tecmo {{released}} a demo {{and a new}} game mode, Survival Mode, for Sigma over the PlayStation Network. The demo limits players to {{the first chapter of}} the game, but lets them play as Rachel in a separate mission. Survival Mode comprises missions in which players keep fighting until they have either killed all their opponents, or <b>their</b> <b>character</b> has been defeated.|$|E
50|$|The game {{broke the}} fourth wall, {{encouraging}} players who had advanced <b>their</b> <b>characters</b> to Lord of Creation status to then in turn take {{the role of}} gamemaster, refereeing the game in <b>their</b> <b>character's</b> pocket universe.|$|R
50|$|The players then discuss who <b>their</b> <b>characters</b> are, {{what they}} are called, and how they relate to each other, and the objects, needs, and {{locations}} <b>their</b> <b>characters</b> share. Once this is decided Act One is ready to begin.|$|R

5|$|The aim of Scouts South Africa is to {{contribute}} to the development of boys, girls and young adults in achieving their full potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national, and international communities by developing <b>their</b> <b>character,</b> training them in citizenship and developing their spiritual, social, mental, and physical qualities.|$|E
5|$|A third sequel, Toy Story 4, will be {{released}} on June 21, 2019. It will be directed by John Lasseter, and {{will focus on the}} toys going to find Bo Peep, who was given away before the third film. Most of the cast of the previous will again reprise <b>their</b> <b>character</b> roles. However Mr. Potato Head will likely be recast for the film because of Don Rickles' death in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Bloodlines is {{presented}} from first- and third-person perspectives. The player assigns <b>their</b> <b>character</b> {{to one of}} several vampire clanseach with unique powers, customizes their combat and dialog abilities and progresses through Bloodlines using violent and nonviolent methods. The selection of clan affects how the player is perceived in the game world, and which powers and abilities they possess; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely between the available hubs: Santa Monica, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown.|$|E
50|$|The main cast of {{the movie}} created Facebook {{profiles}} for <b>their</b> respective <b>characters</b> where they explain some aspects of <b>their</b> <b>characters</b> that weren't explored in the movie.|$|R
25|$|GURPS has {{a profusion}} of {{advantages}} and disadvantages which enable players or Game Masters to customize <b>their</b> <b>characters.</b> The myriad options available and the rewards the system provides players for carefully creating <b>their</b> <b>characters</b> are attractive to gamers who enjoy {{a high degree of}} flexibility in character design.|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>characters</b> are {{guests at}} the event in One Esplanade.|$|R
5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told <b>their</b> <b>character</b> is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender <b>their</b> <b>character</b> is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills <b>their</b> <b>character</b> focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series of question, or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E
5|$|Enix remade Dragon Quest and Dragon QuestII for a one-cartridge {{compilation}} {{known as}} Dragon QuestI+II for the Super Famicom on December18, 1993. The remake sold over 1.2million copies in Japan. In 1998, Enix released BS Dragon Quest for the Super Famicom Satellaview extension exclusively in Japan. The latter consisted of four one-hour scenarios which players would download {{on a weekly}} schedule. Players were tasked with leveling <b>their</b> <b>character,</b> collecting medals and completing scenario-specific conditions with special events designed to occur under specific conditions in real-time.|$|E

5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving <b>their</b> <b>character</b> idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|He next {{turned to}} the subject of wartime female factory workers in The Most Beautiful, a {{propaganda}} film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by <b>their</b> <b>character</b> names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly to examine <b>their</b> <b>character,</b> but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view}} to expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, key {{elements}} of the park, including the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, were grade II listed to preserve <b>their</b> <b>character.</b> Following the 2004 film Closer, based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber, Postman's Park experienced a resurgence of interest; key scenes of both were set in the park itself. In June 2009, a city worker, Jane Shaka (née Michele), via the Diocese of London added a new tablet to the Memorial, the first new addition for 78 years. In November 2013 a free mobile app, The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park, was launched which documents the lives and deaths of those commemorated on the memorial.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in <b>their</b> <b>character.</b> These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil – Code: Veronica {{features}} traditional survival horror gameplay {{found in}} most early Resident Evil games. This includes the series signature controls, interface, puzzles, as well as zombies and monsters to battle. Unlike previous games in the series which used pre-rendered backgrounds, Code: Veronica uses real-time 3D environments. Because of this, the camera is more dynamic than in previous games. The camera will follow, pan, and zoom as the player navigates <b>their</b> <b>character</b> through the environment, similar to Capcom's own Dino Crisis (1999). The story is told through cinematic CGI sequences and in-game cutscenes.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} among anime and manga authors to mention <b>their</b> <b>character's</b> blood types {{and to give}} <b>their</b> <b>{{characters}}</b> blood types to match their personalities.

5|$|Tales of Legendia is a console {{role-playing}} game set in {{a fantasy}} world featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. The game is presented from a top-down perspective, and players must move <b>their</b> <b>character</b> {{through a number of}} locales, battle monsters, and interact with non-player characters to advance the story. Unlike previous games in the series where monsters were visible before being encountered, Tales of Legendia features randomized battles that occur every few steps while inside dungeons or other hostile areas.|$|E
5|$|The Great American Bash event {{featured}} a card, which contained matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed {{a series of}} events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray <b>their</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E

Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed {{a series of}} events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's birth name, as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray <b>their</b> <b>character.</b> All wrestlers were from the SmackDown! brand– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other being Raw.|$|E
