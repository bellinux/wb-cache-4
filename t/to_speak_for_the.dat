Unlike her previous videos, Madonna portrays a narrator, whose song comments on the story, appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action.

5|$|In {{the next}} two years, Jinnah worked to build support among Muslims for the League. He secured the right <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Muslim-led Bengali and Punjabi provincial {{government}}s in the central government in New Delhi ("the centre"). He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League {{along the lines of}} the Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, Liaquat estimated that the League had three million two-anna members.|$|E
5|$|The third letter openly {{incorporates}} Swift's {{argument that}} political authority {{stems from the}} consent of a population. As such, the third letter {{has been seen as}} a response in part to the Declaratory Act, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.|$|E

5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E
5|$|At The Hague 28 April to 1 May 1915, a large {{congress}} of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals. The event {{was called the}} International Congress of Women, or the Women's Peace Congress. The 180-strong contingent of British women was greatly reduced by Winston Churchill's purposeful cancellation of British ferry service across the Channel, stranding most of the British activists. Already in Antwerp, Macmillan easily attended the women's conference <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> UK—she {{was one of only}} three British women present. Macmillan was selected {{as a member of the}} international committee who were to travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world, and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President Woodrow Wilson with it. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his Fourteen Points, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the League of Nations.|$|E

25|$|Virtual {{representation}} {{stated that}} the members of Parliament, including the Lords and the Crown-in-Parliament, reserved the right <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interests of all British subjects, rather than for the interests of only the district that elected them or for the regions in which they held peerages and spiritual sway. Virtual Representation was the British response to the First Continental Congress in the American colonies. The Second Continental Congress asked for representation in Parliament in the Suffolk Resolves, also known as the first Olive Branch Petition. Parliament claimed that their members had the well being of the colonists in mind. The Colonies rejected this premise.|$|E

She stated that she accidentally kept Monk's weekly money allowance {{with the intention of}} giving it back to her, but forgot to do this and was therefore removed from the group. In a 2017 Woman's Day interview, Barry stated that she was paid $1000 to leave and keep quiet on the matter, and blamed her actions on her youth and naivety.|$|E
25|$|The Confederation of British Industry is a UK {{business}} organisation, {{which in}} total speaks for 190,000 businesses, {{made up of}} around 1,500 direct and 188,500 indirect members. There are 140 trade associations within the confederation who, alongside those direct members of the CBI, employ 7 million people, about {{one third of the}} UK private sector-employed workforce. The National Farmers' Union with its 55,000 members is the largest component of the 188,500 indirect members the CBI claims <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> Country Land and Business association brings another 30,000 indirect members, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed 20,000 indirect members, the Freight Transport Association 13,000, the Federation of Master Builders 9,500 and the Road Haulage Association 8,100.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the United Textile Workers (UTW) {{attempted}} {{to break the}} strike, claiming <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> workers of Lawrence. The striking operatives ignored the UTW. The IWW had successfully united the operatives behind ethnic based leaders. These leaders, members of the strike committee, were able to communicate the message of Joseph Ettor to stage only peaceful demonstrations. Ettor did not consider intimidating operatives trying to enter the mills as breaking the peace. The IWW was successful, even with AFL affiliated operatives, because it defended the grievances of all operatives from all the mills. Conversely, the AFL and the mill owners preferred to keep negotiations between each mill and its own operatives. But {{in a move that}} frustrated the UTW, Oliver Christian, national secretary of the Loomfixers Association—an AFL affiliate itself—said he believed John Golden—Massachusetts UTW president—was a detriment to the cause of labor. This statement and missteps by William M. Wood quickly shifted public sentiment to favor the strikers.|$|E

40|$|There’s an {{implicit}} {{assumption that the}} mass media, by definition, {{have something to do}} with the functioning of public in democracy. It is especially the case with the public-service media which would equate serving <b>the</b> public <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> public. The private media are also under pressure to incorporate citizens as actors in the production of their editorial contents. The logic here is the point that, though private in ownership, these media institutionally benefit from the maximum privilege of the speech- and press-freedoms that most societies stipulate in their constitutions. Also noted in this logic is the view that the media are arguably a critical agent of information nurturing an informed citizenry, a prerequisite to fostering consolidation of democracy (Diamond, 1999). In the field of mass communication studies, indeed the concept of public sphere has been made a sophisticated territory a...|$|R
25|$|In 1880, {{he married}} Jessie Ohl, and {{eight years later}} he moved to Chicago {{with his wife and}} young son, Paul. He did not have much {{business}} when he first moved to Chicago, and spent as little as possible. He joined the Henry George Club and made some friends and connections in the city. Being part of the club also gave him an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party on the upcoming election. He slowly {{made a name for himself}} through these speeches, eventually earning the standing to speak in whatever hall he liked. He was offered work as an attorney for the city of Chicago. Darrow worked in the city law department for two years when he resigned and took a position as a lawyer at the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company. In 1894, Darrow represented Eugene V. Debs, the leader of the American Railway Union, who was prosecuted by the federal government for leading the Pullman Strike of 1894. Darrow severed his ties with the railroad to represent Debs, making a financial sacrifice. He saved Debs in one trial but could not keep him from being jailed in another.|$|E

500|$|According to Robert Mahony, the Drapier's Letters, {{especially}} the fourth, were later praised by Irish nationalists. However, as he continued, many recent critics have re-examined this nationalistic claim and asserted a counterclaim that Swift is speaking {{more for the}} Protestants of Ireland than for the entire nation. Many critics, including Carol Fabricant, have asked who [...] "the Whole People of Ireland" [...] are, [...] "who" [...] the Drapier's Letters are speaking [...] "to", and if Swift has the right, as a Protestant Englishman, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire nation. R. F. Foster believes that Swift represented [...] "Ascendancy attitudes," [...] but this view is not held by all. Some critics, like Joep Leerssen, believe that Swift's work contributed greatly to a common Irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation, and that Swift was able to relate to all of Ireland through a unified suffering under the British rule. In overall effect, Fabricant argued that Swift's ability <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole populace is further suggested by the wide consensus opposed to the coinage plan. Along with this, Swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights, in the Drapier's Letters, to all people of Ireland without any regard to restriction.|$|E

He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} also contradicted previous precedent as to {{the nature}} of evidence. John Baker notes that it violates strong rules which exclude the use of written evidence to interpret a document, unless the evidence was found in said document. Baker also argued that ministerial statements should not be used as evidence because they are irrelevant; [...] "no individual member of Parliament {{is in a position to}} state what that intention is or <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silent majority. Parliament acts as a corporate body and the only expression of its common intention is the text to which the Queen and both Houses have given their unqualified assent. What passes in one House is not formally known to the other". An individual MP's statements, minister or not, may be based on a false understanding of the legal issues; MPs regularly vote for proposals having disagreed with the statements of the spokesman simply because they like the proposal itself.|$|E
