The school became a well-known training school for teachers.|$|E

5|$|The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the all-university {{undergraduate}} {{student government}} of Michigan State University. It is unusual amongst university student governments for its decentralized bicameral structure, {{and the relatively}} non-existent influence of the Greek system. The structure has since changed to a single General Assembly as part of reorganization in the late 2000s. ASMSU representatives are nonpartisan and many are elected in noncompetitive races. Their mission is to enhance the individual and collective student experience through education, empowerment, and advocacy by education to <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> interest of students. Some services they offer include: free blue books, low cost copies and printing, free yearbooks, interest free loans, funding for student organizations, free legal consultation, and iClicker and graphing calculator rentals.|$|E

5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{ruled the}} empire {{for over a}} century, until 379. Indeed, until 363, power was held by descendants {{of one of the}} original Junta members. Constantine I' s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a Caesar (deputy emperor) in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. Constantine's grandson Julian ruled until 363. These emperors restored the army to its former strength and effectiveness, but were solely concerned with <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> interests of the military. They were also divorced from the wealthy Roman senatorial families that dominated the Senate and owned much of the empire's land. This in turn bred a feeling of alienation from the army among the Roman aristocracy which in the later 4th century began to resist the military's exorbitant demands for recruits and supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} pitched to the Nine Network through Harris and Graeme-Evans' joint {{independent}} production company, Kids Like Us. A pilot was filmed in mid-1998, which {{was shown to}} a test audience. No changes to the format were made after this test.

The Nine Network initially signed a co-venture with Kids Like Us to produce two 45-episode series of the show and the first went to air on Nine in April 1999.

The first series was produced for US$20,000 to US$30,000 for each episode.|$|E
