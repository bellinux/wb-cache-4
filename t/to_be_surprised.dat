5|$|Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, the arrangers for the Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Legends concerts, {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arrangers for the concert. Additional arrangements were made by Jani Laaksonen and Masashi Hamauzu, and Mikko Laine served as the lyricist for the choral components of the concert. Uematsu {{was not involved in}} any aspect of the production, even song selection, as he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by the result. The style of arrangements followed {{in the tradition of the}} shows preceding Symphonic Odysseys, featuring a number of rich, sophisticated suites structured for melodic storytelling. A focus was put on presenting a balanced mix of fan favorites as well as lesser known material that was not commonly performed in orchestra concerts based on video game music. Böcker styled the concert to be a mix of Shades and Fantasies, in that there was a mix of shorter pieces with longer suites. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were the Final Fantasy series, King's Knight, Chrono Trigger, the SaGa series, The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and Lost Odyssey. Additionally, Uematsu composed an original fanfare to open the concert, which was arranged by Jonne Valtonen.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered {{more dangerous than}} brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by approaching humans. They {{are also likely to}} attack when protecting food.|$|E

Kemp received praise from the Sergeant's Mess and from Prince Harry, who briefly served in Afghanistan as a forward air controller.

Another story {{claims that he}} never took a bath {{because he did not}} want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> unarmed. While the former claim {{may or may not have}} some basis in reality, the latter seems improbable. An unwashed member of the warrior caste would not have been received as a guest by such houses as Honda, Ogasawara, and Hosokawa. These and many other details are likely embellishments that were added to his legend, or misinterpretations of literature describing him.|$|E
25|$|Promoter Vladimir Hryunov won {{the right}} to promote the fight with a purse bid of $23,333,330 and Russian {{businessman}} Andrey Ryabinsky putting up the money. Failed bids made were from K2 Promotions ($7,130,000) and Povetkin's promoter Sauerland Event ($6,014,444). It allowed Ryabinsky to dictate the location of the fight and guaranteed the fighters the biggest purses of their careers. Based on being entitled to 75 percent of the winning bid, Klitschko got $17,499,997, while Povetkin received $5,833,333. The Klitschko camp were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by the bid.|$|E

There is a Vergilian quality in the lines, haunting indeed, a pathos not mentioned {{because it is the}} whole of the story. I suppose that in Satan determining to destroy the innocent happiness of Eden, for the highest political motives, without hatred, not without tears, we may find some echo of the Elizabethan fulness of life that Milton as a poet abandoned, and as a Puritan helped to destroy.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{trademarks}} {{was the use}} of {{two different}} bouncers. One was delivered at a slower pace and was often dealt with quite easily by the batsman. However, this was a ploy by Roberts to lull the batsman into a false sense of security. Roberts would then deliver the second bouncer, pitching in a similar spot to the first, but delivered at far greater pace. The batsman would attempt to play this delivery in the same fashion as the first slower bouncer only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by the extra pace and bounce of the ball. Many batsmen were dismissed, and many more struck painful blows, by Roberts using this ploy.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, Dreamer {{took part}} in the ECW brand's {{elimination}} chase to name a number one contender to the ECW Championship. During the series of matches, also involving Stevie Richards, Elijah Burke, and Kevin Thorn he added a bandana, worn on his head, to his ring gear. He received the original one from a young boy with a brain tumor, and from then on began wearing one as a sign of solidarity and strength to anyone going through that struggle. Dreamer emerged victorious in the final match against Burke, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by ECW's general manager Armando Estrada forcing him to face Big Daddy V, who promptly beat him for the number one contendership.|$|E

When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles dangling from his neck. Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that nobody seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by it. When two friends of Davis (Roy Jenkins and Katie Finneran) come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.|$|E
25|$|In 502, the Anastasian War with Sassanid Persia broke out. Thus in 503, {{along with}} Hypatius and Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus, Patricius was sent east to {{campaign}} against the Persians. He invaded the Persian province of Arzanene, sacking various forts and taking prisoners, before returning to encamp join forces with Hypatius. While Areobindus was detailed to keep watch at the Persian stronghold of Nisibis and the army of Shah Kavadh I (r. 488–531) from Dara, Patricius and Hypatius, with the main force of 40,000 men (an enormous army for the time), were tasked with the recapture of Amida. Although the siege of Amida proved fruitless, together they won a skirmish against some Hephthalite Huns. Their success, however, made them careless allowing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by the main Persian army under Kavadh. Defeated, they retreated across the Euphrates to Samosata. In the aftermath of this, Hypatius was recalled, but Patricius stayed on.|$|E
25|$|Recent bear {{attacks on}} humans have been {{reported}} from Junbesi and Langtang National Park in Nepal, and occurred in villages {{as well as in}} the surrounding forest. Li Guoxing, the second person in history to have received a facial transplant, was a victim of a black bear attack. Nine people were killed by black bears in Japan between 1979–1989, and more recently, in September 2009 it was reported that a black bear attacked a group of tourists, seriously injuring four, while they were waiting at a bus station in the built-up area of Takayama, Gifu in central Japan. The majority of attacks tend to occur when black bears are encountered suddenly, and in close quarters. Because of this, black bears are generally considered more dangerous than sympatric brown bears, which live in more open spaces and are thus less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by approaching humans. They are also likely to attack when protecting food.|$|E
5000|$|This later sparked {{an outrage}} by Cox, who {{intended}} Weird Era Cont. <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> those purchasing the album on its street release date.

25|$|Throughout 2001, 2002 and 2003, {{the band}} worked on writing new material, {{initially}} renting {{a house in}} St. Tropez where sound engineer Mark Tinley built a recording studio for their first serious writing session. They then returned to London to do some self-financed work with various producers (including old friend Nile Rodgers) and {{search for a new}} record deal. It proved difficult to find a record label willing to gamble on the band's comeback, so Duran Duran went on tour to prove the drawing power of the reunited band. The response of the fans and the media exceeded expectations. The band played a handful of 25th-anniversary dates across 2003, starting with two arena dates in Tokyo filled to capacity. Tickets sold out for each show within minutes, and celebrities turned out en masse for reunion dates. Amongst these were a number of shows at smaller venues that the band had played {{on both sides of the}} pond when they first got together in the early 80s. In August, the band were booked as presenters at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> with a Lifetime Achievement Award. They also received a Lifetime Achievement award from Q magazine in October, and the equivalent Outstanding Contribution award at the BRIT Awards in February 2004.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Hot Chip re-recorded several {{songs from}} Made in the Dark, {{with one of}} their [...] "all-time heroes", Robert Wyatt. Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised.</b> I try to do that in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E
500|$|Orci also said, [...] "The comic has {{the themes}} of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has the setting of that {{specific}} time period, so we kept the inspiration from all of that. In terms of {{the specifics of the}} story and who these characters are, we wanted the audience <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> and to not feel like they've already seen everything if they were fans of the comic. So, while the themes and the setting and many of the elements are a great inspiration, the story is completely adapted and translated for live action." [...] The aliens were loosely based on the Anunnaki gods of Zecharia Sitchin's interpretation of the Babylonian religion, who have a distinct interest in gold.|$|E

500|$|Although the C5 reached {{retail stores}} {{at the start}} of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of {{teenagers}} to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that [...] "we haven't done... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off." [...] Sinclair was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> at the lack of demand and blamed the press for [...] "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting". Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.|$|E
500|$|... "Radar" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Britney Spears for her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007). It was written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant and The Clutch, with additional writing from Henrik Jonback, as a record that did not relate to any of her personal problems at the time. The recording sessions took place the day after Spears filed for divorce from Kevin Federline, and members of The Clutch claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> by her work ethic. [...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, but [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was chosen instead. The song was then planned as the fourth single, but the release was cancelled as Spears began recording her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). [...] "Radar" [...] was later included as a bonus track on Circus, and released as the fourth and final single from the album on June 22, 2009 by Jive Records.|$|E
500|$|As Clemmons fled, Officer Richards {{struggled}} {{with him in}} the restaurant's doorway, then shot Clemmons in the back before the officer succumbed to a bullet wound to his head. The shooter stole Richards' Glock pistols before escaping. Clemmons returned to the truck and Allen drove him away. Allen later told detectives he stopped at an intersection and abandoned Clemmons and the truck, claiming he [...] "wants no part of this". Authorities however, later disputed this claim and said there was no evidence Allen abandoned the vehicle. Clemmons was identified later that day as a [...] "person of interest" [...] in the murders, but soon after was identified as a wanted suspect. Police identified no motive for the murders, and Detective Ed Troyer, Pierce County Sheriff’s Office spokesman, said, [...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> if there is a motive worth mentioning."
