5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for retrial {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose this method of execution <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E

One of the men from the lake is there to show his boss' champion Lochaber King. He plots to dye Lad's coat red <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having to answer for the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton {{thought it was a good}} idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
25|$|Several Conservative party members, {{including}} Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, apparently assumed Arar's guilt, labeling him a terrorist.

25|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the Palestinian refugee problem after the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, many Palestinians tried, in one way or another, to return to their homes. For some time these practices continued <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> Israeli authorities until they passed the Prevention of Infiltration Law, which defines offenses of armed and non-armed infiltration to Israel and from Israel to hostile neighboring countries. According to Arab Israeli writer Sabri Jiryis, the purpose of the law was to prevent Palestinians from returning to Israel, those who did so being regarded as infiltrators.|$|E

25|$|The day {{also saw}} the most hyped event of these games, at least in Europe, as the Men's 10km Cross Country Relay was scheduled. The battle stemmed from the Lillehammer games 12 years ago in which Italy out-dueled Norway in that very same event. To that extent, many Norwegians wanted to win this event in order <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> Italians on their home turf, {{but it was not}} to be as Italy crushed the field winning over Germany by over 15seconds to take their 5th {{straight}} gold in this event.

25|$|A trial, which officially {{concerned}} the massacre at Portella della Ginestra convened at Viterbo, Lazio on 12 June 1950, but was quickly adjourned and reconvened in 1951. It then spun {{into a wide}} examination of Giuliano's career. There were thirty six defendants, all with attorneys, many of whom wanted to expand {{the scope of the}} trial <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> conservative government. All of the defendants except Pisciotta denied even being present at the May Day event. Pisciotta named many of the names previously cited, but also included Mario Scelba, Minister of the Interior. His revelations often occurred during barely coherent outburts—his behavior indicated a man in the grip of fear and uncertainty. On 11 May 1951, he admitted murdering Giuliano.|$|E
25|$|Bastia's food {{reserves}} ran dry on 21 May, and Gentili finally sailed {{from the}} harbour on 22 May, sending envoys aboard Hood's flagship HMS Victory {{to sign the}} terms. The conditions were generous: the French troops were to be repatriated to France along with those Corsican who wished to leave. All Corsicans who had joined the French were granted an amnesty and their property was to be respected. Paoli and his Corsicans were furious; Paoli's deputy Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo attempted to intervene and was rebuffed by Hood, and Moore suggested that Hood had granted these terms <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> army, whom the admiral publicly blamed for the length and failures of the siege. Historian Desmond Gregory has suggested instead however that Hood needed the siege concluded primarily so that his fleet to return to urgent operations elsewhere in the Mediterranean.|$|E

25|$|Cripps's mission failed as Gandhi {{would accept}} {{nothing less than}} independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi had stated: Some say Pandit Nehru and I were estranged. It will require much more than {{difference}} of opinion to estrange us. We had differences {{from the time we}} became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor.Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945.|$|E
25|$|Becker {{also had}} to work to resolve an ongoing and lengthy strike in the rubber industry. The United Rubber Workers had struck the Japanese-owned Bridgestone/Firestone tire {{manufacturer}} in July 1994. The company subsequently hired more than 6,000 workers to permanently replace the strikers. The 74,000-member Rubber Workers Union voted {{to return to work}} without a contract. Although the Rubber Workers had rejected merger with the Steelworkers and other unions in the past, now the union's leadership sought merger. The merger was agreed to just as the workers returned to work, and approved by Rubber Workers' members in July 1995. The rubber workers won immediate access to the Steelworkers' $166 million strike fund, research staff, and highly influential pension fund. Becker pushed for a comprehensive campaign strategy to be used against Bridgestone/Firestone. The Steelworkers worked with Japanese labor unions to press the company to negotiate. An innovative public campaign was used <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> company at major events (including the use of a blimp at the Indianapolis 500). These tactics convinced Bridgestone/Firestone management to return to the bargaining table, and the union eventually signed contract that weakened or eliminated a number of management's demands.|$|E

500|$|Henry Cornelius Burnett (October 25, 1825 – October 1, 1866) was a U.S. Representative {{from the}} state of Kentucky and a Confederate States senator. A lawyer by profession, Burnett had held only one public office—circuit court clerk—before being elected to Congress. He {{represented}} Kentucky's 1st congressional district immediately prior to the Civil War. This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state, which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky. Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason. Unionist newspaper editor George D. Prentice described Burnett as [...] "a big, burly, loud-mouthed fellow who is forever raising points of order and objections, <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> Republicans in the House".|$|E

500|$|After the verdict, the District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced {{a furious}} gay {{community}} {{to explain what}} had gone wrong. The prosecutor admitted to feeling sorry for White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who had recorded White's confession (and who was a childhood friend of White's and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, {{he did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> detective in front of his family in court. Nor did Freitas question White's frame of mind, lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive. Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver testified {{on the last day of}} the trial that White and Milk were not friendly, yet she had contacted the prosecutor and insisted on testifying. It was the only testimony the jury heard about their strained relationship. Freitas blamed the jury whom he claimed had been [...] "taken in by the whole emotional aspect of [...] trial".|$|E
500|$|Gardner was {{diagnosed}} with antisocial personality disorder. [...] In June 1985, Gardner pleaded guilty {{to the murder of}} Otterstrom and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At one point, Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a leg brace that would lock if he attempted to escape again. He was advised by guards that it would be to his benefit to behave in front of prospective jurors. District Judge Jay E. Banks instructed the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the option of a verdict for the lesser offense of manslaughter if they found Gardner to be under mental or emotional duress when he shot Burdell. The jurors deliberated less than three hours and found Gardner guilty of capital murder. Ultimately sentenced to death, Gardner selected execution by firing squad over lethal injection. Legislators in Utah had eliminated the firing squad as a method of execution in 2004, but convicts who were sentenced before that date, such as Gardner, could still select that option. Since 1976, only two other people have been executed by firing squad in the United States, both in Utah: Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor. In contrast to Taylor, who said he chose the firing squad <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> state, Gardner's attorney said that his client did not want to attract attention and simply preferred to die this way.|$|E
500|$|Bradley {{called the}} militia to Frankfort to {{maintain}} order, and considered adjourning the session to an opera house in Louisville where more security could be provided. Some leading Democrats in Louisville lauded Bradley for preserving order, but Democratic lawmakers in the Senate sought {{the passage of}} resolutions to convict Bradley of interference with the election, fine him $500, and sentence him to six months in jail. These same legislators also threatened to imprison Lieutenant Governor William Jackson Worthington, allowing Democratic President pro tem of the Senate William Goebel to become acting governor. A committee was appointed to investigate Bradley, but the resolutions to convict and imprison him were not passed. On March 16, Governor Bradley declared martial law in the capital. The session adjourned later that day without having elected a senator. Among the session's few accomplishments were bills creating two reform houses {{in the state and}} providing for free turnpikes and gravel roads. A bill forbidding the employment of children of school age who had not attended at least twelve weeks of school during the year passed over Bradley's veto. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>embarrass</b> <b>the</b> governor, the Senate refused to pass a revenue bill, leaving the governor with no money to run the state. Following the session, a Northern Kentucky newspaper opined [...] "It is hard to conceive how a legislature would go about accomplishing less than this present one has." ...|$|E
