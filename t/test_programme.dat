5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the <b>test</b> <b>programme,</b> Senior Prom was {{cancelled}} in 1982; reportedly one reason for the cancellation of the project was that the size and configuration of the Senior Prom aircraft rendered it incapable of being carried in internal weapons bays such as that on the B-1 bomber; the AGM-129 ACM, a competing design to Senior Prom for the cruise missile requirement, had a more slender airframe with retractable wings, which rendered it capable of internal carriage; it began flight testing shortly {{after the end of the}} Senior Prom programme.|$|E
5|$|In {{presence}} of then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was {{rolled out of}} the final assembly line on 14 February 1987 and made its maiden flight on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes from Toulouse. The flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> took 1,200 hours on 530 flights, European Joint Aviation Authorities certification was delivered on 26 February 1988. The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March 1988.|$|E

5|$|The flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> {{started in}} 1985 with the maiden flight of a {{converted}} Tu-142M fitted with the advanced avionics; state acceptance trials began within two years. Test results proved excellent, as the aircraft successfully tracked nuclear-powered submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets. The aircraft became operational with Russian Naval Aviation (AV-MP) in 1993. The last Tu-142MZ {{rolled off the}} Taganrog production line the following year, bringing an end to a 26-year production run during which 100 Tu-142s were produced.|$|E
5|$|In December 1999, the Russian {{government}} outlined that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 {{estimated that the}} country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on its belly after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It looked as though the A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E

Also, {{although it is not}} directly representative of real operating conditions, the appropriateness of a towing lank for the model tidal current turbine testing has been supported, by having obtained compatible force and wake profiles in the two <b>test</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
25|$|The initial <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> {{was flown}} by Ilyushin staff, ending two months ahead of {{schedule}} on October 20, 1978.

(According to a faster schedule announced {{at the time of}} the first flight, Ilyushin tests were to have ended in time for the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution on November 7, 1977.) In-house testing involved speeds up to Mach 0.93 and bank angles up to 11 degrees greater than specified.|$|E

50|$|The US National Institute on Aging {{currently}} funds {{an intervention}} <b>testing</b> <b>programme,</b> whereby investigators nominate compounds (based on specific molecular ageing theories) to have evaluated {{with respect to}} their effects on lifespan and age-related biomarkers in outbred mice. Previous age-related testing in mammals has proved largely irreproducible, because of small numbers of animals and lax mouse husbandry conditions. The intervention <b>testing</b> <b>programme</b> aims to address this by conducting parallel experiments at three internationally recognised mouse ageing-centres, the Barshop Institute at UTHSCSA, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the Jackson Laboratory.|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) Directive 97 / 12 /EC {{allows the}} trade of cattle within the EU of animals {{originating}} from an 'officially brucellosis-free herd'.

The authors conducted a study to compare the merits and costs of <b>testing</b> <b>programmes</b> given in the Directive and of some alternative testing strategies. The effectiveness of <b>testing</b> <b>programmes</b> was evaluated by a Monte Carlo simulation model. Programmes listed in the Directive do not appear to have identical sensitivity and specificity. Simulations of the programmes showed that milk testing may be more effective and efficient than blood testing to identify infected herds. Results indicated that it could be advisable that legislation, rather than defining very detailed procedures both for laboratory <b>tests</b> and <b>testing</b> <b>programmes,</b> should establish minimal requirements in terms of efficacy of testing procedures (i. e. the probability of detecting an infected herd) ...|$|R
