A narrowly divided court overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for receiving child pornography <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail,</b> ruling that postal inspectors had implanted a desire to do so through repeated written entreaties.|$|E
5|$|Keith Jacobson {{was offered}} only two {{opportunities}} to buy child pornography <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail.</b> Both times, he ordered. Both times, {{he asked for}} opportunities to buy more. He needed no Government agent to coax, threaten, or persuade him; no one played on his sympathies, friendship, or suggested that his committing the crime would further a greater good. In fact, no Government agent even contacted him face to face.|$|E

Reich and another associate, Dr. Michael Silvert, were charged with contempt of court; Silvert had been looking after the inventory in Reich's absence. Reich at first refused to attend court, and was arrested and held for two days until a supporter posted bail of $30,000.|$|E

5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail.</b> New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail,</b> or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E

It is misleading because the cancelled envelope appears to have gone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mails</b> though it has not. For instance, it is missing additional postal markings typically applied to real mail.|$|R
