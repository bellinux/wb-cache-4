5|$|A {{call for}} <b>tenders</b> was made, and the tender {{accepted}} was for £1,833, {{well above the}} £1,200 maximum specified in the call for <b>tenders.</b> Payment was delayed until February 1839.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nearly {{fifteen of}} the <b>tenders</b> {{remained}} wedded {{to their original}} locomotives, others received new partners - the very first tender to be manufactured swapped partners seven times. After the Second World War, when the streamlined <b>tenders</b> were de-streamlined, {{it was difficult to}} spot any mismatches. The most readily visible mismatches were those of locomotives Nos. 6249–6252 where pre-produced Type 'A' streamlined <b>tenders</b> were married to unstreamlined locomotives.|$|E

When a <b>tender</b> or bid is being called, a <b>tender</b> or bid number is usually issued as a reference number for the <b>tender</b> box. The <b>tender</b> box would be open for interested parties to submit their proposals {{for the duration of the}} bid or <b>tender.</b>|$|R

50|$|Invitation to <b>tender</b> is also {{a similar}} process to a <b>tender</b> notification. The major {{difference}} is the institution or organisation who created the <b>tender</b> chooses who to invite, often {{in the form of}} a closed <b>tender.</b> <b>Tender</b> notification services provide a vast array of people and companies about an open <b>tender</b> that anyone can apply for.|$|R
5|$|All LMS <b>tenders</b> {{were given}} {{their own unique}} {{identity}} numbers and they tended to be constructed {{in advance of the}} locomotives they would be paired with. Hence, they were made in four batches, Nos. 9703–9709, 9743–9752, 9798–9817 and 10622-10624.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in <b>tenders,</b> which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the <b>tenders</b> pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} state governments issued {{requests}} for tender for {{the supply of}} sterile fluids and PD fluids. Baxter responded to the requests with <b>tenders</b> that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate.|$|E

50|$|It was a {{tank wagon}} type <b>tender,</b> similar in {{appearance}} to the North American Vanderbilt type <b>tender,</b> with a cylindrical water tank which had an inside diameter of 6 ft. The <b>tender</b> {{was similar to}} the Type MX <b>tender,</b> but its wheelbase was 10 ft shorter. Like the Type MX <b>tender,</b> it rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies, supplied by General Steel Castings of Eddystone, Pennsylvania, and became commonly known as a Torpedo <b>tender.</b> Like its engine, the <b>tender</b> was equipped with vacuum brakes.|$|R

5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' <b>tenders</b> were distinguishable from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E
5|$|A tram {{network has}} long been planned in Skopje and the idea was first {{proposed}} in the 1980s. The project became real in 2006 when the mayor Trifun Kostovski asked for feasibility studies. His successor Koce Trajanovski launched a call for <b>tenders</b> in 2010 and the first line is scheduled for 2019.|$|E
5|$|By May 1985, {{three months}} behind schedule, the review board narrowed the <b>tenders</b> {{down to two}} contenders in each group: IKL/HDW and Kockums for the submarine, Rockwell and Signaal for the combat system. The Walrus and Type 2400submarine designs were {{considered}} to be too expensive to manufacture because of inefficient building practices, while the combat data system <b>tenders</b> had been narrowed down by unjustified development risk in the Plessey and Krupp/Ferranti proposals, and the dual problems in the Sintra Alcatel tender of excessive power usage and incompatibility with the proposed American weapons system. On 9 May, the Australian cabinet approved the selections for the funded studies and decided that six submarines would be built, with the option for two more, all in Australia.|$|E

The front of the engine and the back of the <b>tender</b> were fitted with modified and strengthened draft gear. The intermediate drawgear between engine and <b>tender</b> was similar in design to that of the Class 15F. The engine and <b>tender</b> were both fitted with vacuum brakes.|$|R

5|$|The company's {{financial}} difficulties after 1866 had precluded the purchasing of any more locomotives until six 4-4-0 locomotives {{were built in}} 1876 by Neilson's, partly to replace the Deeside locomotives. These had larger boilers and fireboxes than previous locomotives and {{were the first to}} be built with cabs. The next twelve locomotives had rounded splashers over the trailing driving wheels, meaning the shape of the cab was different, but retained the brass dome on the firebox, copper capped chimney and had brass bands joining the firebox and boiler. After James Manson became locomotive superintendent in 1883 he introduced a more contemporary design of locomotive, with inside cylinders and doors on the side of cabs and without brass domes or copper chimneys. The first six were built by Kitson & Co in Leeds in 1884, followed by three similar but lighter in 1885. The railway had inherited most of its tank engines from the Deeside, Morayshire and Banffshire Railways and these needed replacing, so six arrived in 1884 and three slightly larger the following year. The first tank engines in the country to be fitted with doors on the cabs, these worked on the suburban services and one was fitted with a cowcatcher to work the St Combs Light Railway at Fraserburgh. In 1887 two locomotives were built at Kittybrewster works. Although there was only space for four locomotives in the cramped repair shops the board expected to save £300 to £400 by building the locomotives themselves. Nine express locomotives with six-wheeled <b>tenders</b> were built by Kitsons in 1888 and these were followed by six more with eight-wheeled <b>tenders</b> built by Stephenson & Co, one of which was successfully trialled in 1914 with a superheater. Most of Manson's later locomotives were subsequently fitted with superheaters, the eight-wheeled <b>tenders</b> being replaced in most cases with six-wheeled <b>tenders</b> during the rebuild.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{concluded}} that the IKL/HDW Type2000 was the best design offered, the Walrus class was rated as 'fair', while Kockums' and Vickers' proposals were considered 'marginal' contenders. However, none of the <b>tenders</b> completely matched the desired RAN specifications, and the two proposals selected {{would have to be}} redesigned during the funded study.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} by a contractor, Mark Farrell, {{for the cost}} of £15,232, using prison labor, and supervised by Beazeley. Both the lighthouse and three sandstone lighthouse keeper cottages were constructed from locally quarried sandstone. The lighthouse was first displayed in February 1857, though <b>tenders</b> for painting the tower were called for only in December 1858.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{variations}} on the Pump <b>Tender</b> are the Pump Aerial <b>Tender</b> and the Pump Rescue <b>Tender.</b> The Pump Aerial <b>Tender</b> has an additional aerial ladder and monitor for high-rise and aerial attacks.

Typical equipment includes hydraulic rescue tools (aka [...] "The Jaws of Life"), vehicle stabilisation equipment, and winches.|$|R
