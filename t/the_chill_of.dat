These dogs have huge lung capacity for swimming extremely long distances, and a thick, oily, and waterproof double coat which protects them from <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> icy waters. The double coat makes the dog hard to groom, and also causes a lot of shedding to occur. The droopy lips and jowls make the dog drool, especially in high heat.|$|E

500|$|On {{the last}} {{evening of the}} visit, as they lie in their {{respective}} beds, the chief protagonists muse on their personal histories in a surreal series of interwoven dialogues. Nixon and Pat recall the struggles of their youth; Nixon evokes wartime memories ("Sitting round the radio"). Mao and Chiang Ch'ing dance together, as the Chairman remembers [...] "the tasty little starlet" [...] who came to his headquarters {{in the early days}} of the revolution. As they reminisce, Chiang Ch'ing asserts that [...] "the revolution must not end". Chou meditates alone; the opera finishes on a thoughtful note with his aria [...] "I am old and I cannot sleep", asking: [...] "How much of what we did was good?"

2500|$|Publishers Weekly {{said the}} third volume was [...] "one {{of the more}} {{rewarding}} examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy. [...] The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates. Those two fantasy greats are also evoked by Martin's ability to convey such sensual experiences as the heat of wildfire, <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> ice, {{the smell of the}} sea and the sheer gargantuan indigestibility of the medieval banquet at its most excessive. Perhaps this saga doesn't go as far beyond the previous bounds of high fantasy as some claim, but for most readers it certainly goes far enough to command their attention." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hirohito and {{all members}} of the {{imperial}} family implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Takeda and Prince Higashikuni were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of Bonner Fellers who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment. Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, [...] "with the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor" [...] and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime [...] "cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in <b>the</b> <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> the Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister Nobusuke Kishi." [...] For Herbert Bix, [...] "MacArthur's truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{substitution}} of air condensation by water condensation in <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> <b>of</b> a university building. This building has a surface of about 30, 000 m 2, {{is located in a}} city of the Spanish north coast, and refrigeration is needed for six months a year. In this paper, the novelty lies in the cooling system of the condensation water, since the typical cooling tower {{is not going to be}} considered; instead, the domestic cold water consumed in the building would be used to cool <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> condensing water. As the domestic water consumption in the building is neither constant nor coincident with the cooling requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller,</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> the fire water tank as heat storage was proposed. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is cooled by the water contained in the fire tank and this fire water is then cooled by the domestic water. With this solution, the reduction in the annual energy consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chiller</b> is around 18. 6...|$|R
