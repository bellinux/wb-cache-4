5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E
5|$|Born to an upper-class family, David {{rebelled against}} social {{norms of the}} day. In the 1930s she studied art in Paris, became an actress, and ran off with a married man with whom she sailed in a small boat to Italy, where their boat was confiscated. They reached Greece, where they were nearly <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German {{invasion}} in 1941, but escaped to Egypt, where they parted. She then worked for the British government, running a library in Cairo. While there she married, but the marriage was not long-lived.|$|E
5|$|During the cease-fire, {{the abbey}} offers shelter to {{refugees}} fleeing the regions affected by fallout, {{which results in}} a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's ciborium containing consecrated hosts, {{but it is too}} late. He is <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> falling walls of the abbey, and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).|$|E

Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} by Day 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his acute asthma. Nevertheless, he {{continues}} to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast from the community of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1940, Fraser, {{her sister}} , and the cruiser Calcutta were {{returning}} from St. Jean de Luz after rescuing refugees <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German Army (Operation Ariel), when Fraser was rammed by Calcutta in the Gironde estuary. Struck {{forward of the}} bridge by the cruiser's bow, Fraser was cut in half and sank immediately. All but 45 of the ship's crew were rescued by Restigouche and other nearby ships. Many of the survivors from Fraser transferred that later summer to , and were lost when that vessel sank on 22 October 1940 {{as a result of}} a collision with the freighter MV Port Fairy.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> body of the ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{hydrogen}} diffusion in plasma hydrogenated Si/SiGe/Si heterostructure at different temperatures. At low temperature, intrinsic point defects in the {{molecular beam epitaxy}} grown Si capping layer are found {{to compete with the}} buried strain SiGe layer for hydrogen trapping. The interaction of hydrogen with point defects affects the hydrogen long-range diffusion, and restricts the amount of hydrogen available for <b>trapping</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SiGe layer. However, hydrogen <b>trapping</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> capping layer is attenuated with increasing hydrogenation temperature allowing more hydrogen to be trapped in the strain SiGe layer with subsequent surface blister formation. A potential temperature window for plasma hydrogenation induced layer separation is identified based on the combined considerations of trap-limited diffusion at low temperature and outdiffusion of H{sub 2 } molecule together with the dissociation of Si-H bonds inside of H platelet at high temperature...|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Elite Force, Wildstorm {{published}} a graphic novel based on Raven Software's story. The graphic novel was released in July 2000 as part of a Star Trek: Voyager graphic novel series produced by Wildstorm, written by British comic book authors Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The book's artwork was produced by Jeffrey Moy and W.C. Carani. The book follows a broadly similar storyline to that of the game, predominantly focusing on USS Voyager being <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Forge, which is controlled by an ancient race, the Tarlus, for the purpose of creating an army to conquer the galaxy. The Elite Force graphic novel focuses on a limited number of the Hazard Team, and does not expand on the plot points created by the Etherians and the scavengers in the game, instead using the Borg to fill in these roles.|$|E
5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex decidua), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
5|$|The party meets Xezat, one of Galuf's companions and {{a former}} Warrior of Dawn, and learn that Bartz's father was part of their group. Joining forces, they {{deactivate}} the barrier around Exdeath's castle, but {{at the cost of}} Xezat's life. They then learn of Exdeath's origins, traveling to the Guardian Tree to dispel the seals. Exdeath anticipates the party's actions and torches Moore Forest, ensnaring the group. Krile arrives to help, but is herself <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> warlock's powers. At the sight of his granddaughter's capture, Galuf frees himself and battles Exdeath to the point of death, refusing to fall until the creature flees. Collapsing from his wounds, Galuf dies despite the party's efforts to save him, imparting his abilities to Krile. The party pursues Exdeath to his tower and defeats him, but the remaining Crystals shatter and the worlds are reunited.|$|E

5|$|These dismal {{business}} efforts—and his misadventures in Sardinia—provided {{an appropriate}} milieu {{in which to}} set the two-volume Illusions perdues (Lost Illusions, 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré, a young poet {{trying to make a}} name for himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work is informed by Balzac's own failed ventures in the field. Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (The Harlot High and Low, 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Abbé Herrera (Vautrin) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.|$|E
5|$|Written by Robert Holmes, {{this story}} was planned as the 20th anniversary special. The 90-minute single-part story was {{commissioned}} on 2 August 1982 and would involve the various Doctors and companions drawn to the planet Maladoom where they are <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Master who is working for the Cybermen. The Cybermen want to isolate the genetic material that permits Time Lords to time travel freely {{so that they can}} incorporate that information into their own biology. The First Doctor would be revealed as an android, hence the title being the Six Doctors. Holmes made little headway with the script and withdrew from the project on 13 October 1982. Holmes would later use part of the storyline in The Two Doctors.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression to suddenly pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E

40|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of {{addition of}} benzoyloxyl radicals to the conformationally rigid cyclohexene, trans- 2 -octalin, {{in the presence}} of the free radical scavenger 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 1 H-isoindol- 2 -yloxyl, is reported. Axial addition was favoured over equatorial addition with modest selectivity (axialequatorial = 1. 71. 0). The aminoxyl trapping reaction was more selective with a ratio of transcis addition of 4. 41. 0. Interestingly, when the benzoate group is axial, axial <b>trapping</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sterically hindered aminoxyl is strongly favoured (axialequatorial = 7. 41. 0), whereas when the benzoate group is equatorial, there is only a small preference for equatorial <b>trapping</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aminoxyl (equatorialaxial = 2. 41. 0). The structures of the four possible addition products were determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and confirmed in the case of the diaxial addition product [2 (ax) -benzoyloxy- 3 (ax) -(1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyl- 2, 3 -dihydroisoindol- 2 -yloxy) -trans-decalin 3] by X-ray crystallographic analysis.

5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the Forge to tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Forge to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the Forge and destroys the station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. Voyager and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently <b>trapped</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E

Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E
