5|$|Decorative mosaic tilings made {{of small}} squared blocks called <b>tesserae</b> were widely {{employed}} in classical antiquity, sometimes displaying geometric patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of <b>tesserae.</b> The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of <b>tesserae,</b> on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of <b>tesserae</b> smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of <b>tesserae,</b> but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} showing the embayment of <b>tessera</b> by pdl's material in some <b>tessera</b> margins. Thus, {{it is possible}} that this unit is younger than the <b>tessera</b> unit.|$|R
5000|$|McWilliams was President and CEO of <b>Tessera</b> Technologies from 1999 to 2008 and Chairman and CSO until 2009 [...] McWilliams was {{recruited}} by <b>Tessera</b> {{to turn around}} the chip packaging business into a profitable and growing company. McWilliams changed the strategic direction away from manufacturing and built a successful licensing business model focused on the mobile phone and semiconductor memory market. <b>Tessera</b> has licensed its chip packaging technology to numerous semiconductor manufacturers, including Intel and Samsung Electronics. McWilliams took <b>Tessera</b> public in 2003. [...] During McWiliams’ tenure, <b>Tessera</b> experienced remarkable compounded revenue and operating profit growth which led to <b>Tessera</b> being cited by Business Week as the Second Hottest Growing Company in America in 2006 and the 20th Hottest Growing Company in 2007. In 2006, Electronic Business cited <b>Tessera</b> as the 4th Best Small Electronics Company in the US.|$|R
25|$|Isothermal Systems and <b>Tessera</b> Technologies partnered on {{a defense}} project that {{received}} $4.5 million in earmarks over 2003 and 2004. Isothermal had Letitia White as a lobbyist; <b>Tessera</b> had her husband, Richard. <b>Tessera</b> paid Richard White $300,000 in fees between 2003 and 2005.|$|R
5|$|Mosaics {{are among}} the most {{enduring}} of Roman decorative arts, and are found on the surfaces of floors and other architectural features such as walls, vaulted ceilings, and columns. The most common form is the tessellated mosaic, formed from uniform pieces (<b>tesserae)</b> of materials such as stone and glass. Mosaics were usually crafted on site, but sometimes assembled and shipped as ready-made panels. A mosaic workshop was led by the master artist (pictor) who worked with two grades of assistants.|$|E
5|$|The paved {{walkways}} of Delos {{range from}} simple pebble or chip-pavement constructions to elaborate mosaic floors composed of <b>tesserae.</b> Most motifs contain simple geometric patterns, while {{only a handful}} utilize the opus tessellatum and opus vermiculatum techniques to create lucid, naturalistic, and richly-colored scenes and figures. Mosaics {{have been found in}} places of worship, public buildings, and private homes, the latter usually containing either an irregular-shaped floor plan or peristyle central courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{a symbol}} of the Punic-Phoenician goddess Tanit, all {{pavement}} motifs are typically Hellenistic Greek in origin, although some pavement mortars used with <b>tesserae</b> designs betray some Italian influence. Although the three major ethnic groups of Delos included Greeks (largely of Athenian origin), Syrians/Phoenicians, and Italians/Romans, it is very likely that many of these Italians were Italiotes, Greek-speaking natives of Magna Graecia in what is now southern Italy. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that the designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{similarity}} between the morphologies of Venus trough-and-ridge <b>tessera</b> and the earth's ocean floor is discussed. The hypothesis that <b>tessera</b> texture {{might be related to}} a crustal fabric produced at spreading centers is examined. It is suggested that the proccesses that produce the ocean floor fabric on earth are good candidates for the origin and production of the trough-and-ridge <b>tessera.</b> To support this hypothesis, the characteristics of the trough-and-ridge terrain in Laima <b>Tessera</b> are described and compared to the seafloor at spreading centers...|$|R
5|$|Celtiberian is {{documented}} as a written language only after {{contact with the}} Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens (<b>tesserae</b> hospitales), twenty {{of which are in}} the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for composing Pharaoh, Prus made a painstaking study of Egyptological sources, including works by John William Draper, Ignacy Żagiell, Georg Ebers and Gaston Maspero. Prus actually incorporated ancient texts into his novel like <b>tesserae</b> into a mosaic; drawn from one such text {{was a major}} character, Ennana.|$|E
25|$|It {{is the art}} {{of putting}} {{together}} or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design.Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as <b>tesserae,</b> (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.|$|E

50|$|The {{boundaries}} of <b>tessera</b> shows embayment by other materials of other units. By this cross-cutting relationship, it provides evidence of <b>tessera</b> being the oldest unit within the strata.|$|R
50|$|In the {{downwelling}} model, mantle downwelling, possibly due to mantle convection, causes {{compression and}} thickening of the crust, creating the compressional elements of <b>tessera</b> terrain. Isostatic rebound occurs {{due to the}} crustal thickening. After downwelling ends, a delamination event within the mantle produces extensional elements of <b>tessera.</b> This model does not currently explain <b>tessera's</b> location within crustal plateaus, and instead predicts a domical shape.|$|R
25|$|Shards {{of broken}} glass or glass rods were being used in mosaics from the Augustan period onwards, but by the {{beginning}} of the 1st century small glass tiles, known as <b>tesserae,</b> were being produced specifically for use in mosaics. These were usually in shades of yellow, blue or green, and were predominantly used in mosaics laid under fountains or as highlights.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of this glass has revealed {{that they are a}} soda-lime-silica glass but with a lower iron and manganese oxide content than the high iron, manganese and titanium glass used to make vessels. The similarity between the composition of the glass inlays and Roman coloured glass is remarkable, so much so that {{it is likely that the}} Anglo-Saxon craftworkers were re-using Roman opaque glass, possibly Roman glass <b>tesserae.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{latter is}} well preserved, {{and is one}} of the finest Italian cloisters now extant both for size and beauty of detail. It is about 2,200m2, with pointed arches {{decorated}} with diaper work, supported on pairs of columns in white marble, 216 in all, which were alternately plain and decorated by bands of patterns in gold and colors, made of glass <b>tesserae,</b> arranged either spirally or vertically from end to end of each shaft. The marble capitals are each carved with foliage, biblical scenes and allegories, no two being alike. At one angle, a square pillared projection contains the marble fountain or monks' lavatorium, evidently the work of Muslim sculptors.|$|E
40|$|Tectonic {{deformation}} {{is cited}} as the cause for the complex morphology and topography of Eastern Ishtar Terra. A number of models proposed to account for this deformation are reviewed, and their predictions for the geology of Fortuna <b>Tessera</b> are examined. The detailed geology, topography, and structural fabric of Eastern Ishtar are reviewed, and these observations are compared to the predictions of the existing models for the formation and evolution of Fortuna <b>Tessera.</b> On {{the basis of the}} analysis, a number of conclusions are drawn regarding the evolution of Eastern Ishtar Terra. These include the recognition of primary morphological and topographical patterns which allow Eastern Ishtar Terra to be divided into four major physiographic regions named Maxwell Montes, Eastern Fortuna <b>Tessera,</b> Central Fortuna <b>Tessera,</b> and Northern Fortuna <b>Tessera.</b> A model is suggested that accounts for the morphology and high topography of Eastern Ishtar Terra...|$|R
40|$|The Tellus Regio-Meni <b>Tessera</b> {{region is}} an {{interesting}} highland area characterized by large areas of complex ridged terrain or <b>tessera</b> terrain. The area was previously studied from the Venera 15 / 16 data, typical characteristics of complex <b>tessera</b> terrain of Tellus Regio were analyzed, and a formation mechanism was proposed. Apparent depths of compensation of approximately 30 - 50 km were calculated from Pioneer Venus gravity and topography data. These values indicate predominant Airy compensation for the area. Regional stresses and lithospheric structures were defined from analysis of surface structures, topography, and gravity data. In this work we concentrate on northeastern Tellus Regio and Meni <b>Tessera,</b> which are situated north and west of Tellus Regio. Structural features and relationships are analyzed in order to interpret tectonic history of the area. Study area was divided into three subareas: northeastern Tellus Regio, Meni <b>Tessera,</b> and the deformed plain between them...|$|R
40|$|Mapping of <b>tessera</b> terrain using Magellan global {{high-resolution}} {{data has}} shown that it comprises about 10 percent of the surface area of Venus, is not randomly distributed, is extremely highly deformed relative to intervening plains, lies at {{a wide range of}} elevations, is embayed by and largely predates adjacent volcanic plains, is generally negatively correlated with broad lowlands and volcanic rises, may underlie a considerable percentage of the superposed volcanic plains, and has linear/tectonic margins for about 27 percent of its boundaries. In this paper, we investigate further the distribution and origin of <b>tessera</b> through analysis of the changing nature of <b>tessera</b> occurrences during sequential flooding, and assessment of the nature and distribution of Type 2 (linear/tectonic) <b>tessera</b> boundaries...|$|R
25|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} phrase book plate was in 1791 by John Ireland in Hogarth Illustrated. Bookplates of that period offer very distinctive characteristics. In the simplicity of their heraldic arrangements they recall those of the previous age; but their physiognomy is totally different. In the first place, they invariably display the tincture lines and dots, after the method originally devised {{in the middle of}} the century by Petra Sancta, the author of <b>Tesserae</b> Gentilitiae, which by this time had become adopted throughout Europe. In the second, the mantling assumes a much more elaborate appearance—one that irresistibly recalls that of the periwig of the period surrounding the face of the shield. This style was undoubtedly imported from France, but it assumed a character of its own in England.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the common}} law courts do not regard coats of arms as either {{property}} or as being defensible by action, armorial bearings are a form of property nevertheless, generally described as <b>tesserae</b> gentilitatis or insignia of gentility. Armorial bearings are incorporeal and impartible hereditaments, inalienable, and descendable {{according to the law}} of arms. Generally speaking (there have been very rare examples of patents in which the arms are granted to descend with some different limitation), this means they are inherited by the issue (male and female) in the male line of the grantee, though they can be inherited as quarterings by the sons of an heraldic heiress, where there is no surviving male heir, provided her issue also have a right to bear arms in their own male line.|$|E
500|$|Red-figure pottery was {{no longer}} {{produced}} {{by the time the}} Delos mosaics were made. However, the black background technique of red-figure pottery was still appreciated in not only 4th-century-BC Macedonian pebble mosaics from Pella, but also mosaics at Delos, such as the white-figured tritoness mosaic with <b>tesserae.</b> The black background technique was later used in glass art such as cameo glass, particularly Roman glass (e.g. Portland Vase, Gemma Augustea, Great Cameo of France, etc.).|$|E

40|$|We analyze night-time {{near-infrared}} (NIR) {{images of}} Beta-Phoebe region obtained with the 1 -μm channel of the Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC) onboard Venus Express. Comparisons {{with the results}} of the Magellan radar survey and the model NIR images show that the night-time VMC images provide reliable information on spatial variations of the NIR surface emission. Here we consider if <b>tessera</b> terrain has the different NIR emissivity (and thus mineralogical composition) in com- parison to the surrounding basaltic plains. This is done through the study of an area SW of Beta Regio where there is a massif of <b>tessera</b> terrain, Chimon-mana <b>Tessera,</b> surrounded by supposedly basaltic plains. Our analysis showed that 1 -μm emissivity of <b>tessera</b> surface material is by 15 – 35...|$|R
500|$|The Maya {{exhibited}} {{a preference for}} the colour green or blue-green, and used the same word for the colours blue and green. Correspondingly, they placed high value on apple-green jade, and other greenstones, associating them with the sun-god K'inich Ajau. They sculpted artefacts that included fine <b>tesserae</b> and beads, to carved heads weighing [...] The Maya nobility practised dental modification, and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth. Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade, {{such as that of}} K'inich Janaab' Pakal, king of Palenque.|$|E
500|$|The Delos {{mosaic of}} Dionysos riding a tiger in the House of Dionysos {{is one of}} the finest {{examples}} of opus vermiculatum, according to Dunbabin, and is comparable to the Dionysos riding a leopard from the House of the Masks if not the simpler [...] from the Macedonian capital at Pella. A key thematic difference, however, are the wings of Dionysos that suggest his incarnation as a daimon instead of a god. The <b>tesserae</b> materials, made of glass, faience, terracotta and natural stones, are fashioned into pieces measuring roughly one millimeter square, allowing for sharp detail and an elaborate color scheme.|$|E
500|$|The city of Rome had a {{place called}} the Campus Martius ("Field of Mars"), which was a sort of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth {{assembled}} to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. [...] Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. [...] In the countryside, pastimes included fishing and hunting. [...] Board games played in Rome included dice (<b>Tesserae</b> or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. Other activities included chariot races, and musical and theatrical performances.|$|E
50|$|The low {{viscosity}} basaltic flows that compose Irnini Mons overlay several regional plains and <b>tessera</b> units of Eistla Regio. The oldest observed rocks are a highly deformed <b>tessera</b> unit with ridges and grabens at high angles between one another which create the tessera-textured pattern {{for which it}} is named. The plains units are generally less deformed, but show a dominant linear trend of wrinkle ridges going in an east-west direction from the prevalent north-south compression. The <b>tessera</b> structures are truncated by the east-west wrinkle ridges, indicating the <b>tessera</b> formed before the wrinkle ridges. The youngest plains material is significantly less deformed than the older plains material and underlies the Irnini flows. All impact craters observed occurred prior to formation of the east-west wrinkle ridges.|$|R
