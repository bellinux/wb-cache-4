5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that {{the goals of the}} campaign were <b>too</b> <b>broad,</b> that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|E
5|$|Google has {{questioned}} the proposal, saying the prohibitions would be <b>too</b> <b>broad.</b> It is strongly opposed by free speech groups. A poll conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research for the Hungry Beast television program found that 80% of their 1,000 respondents were {{in favour of}} the concept of the plan. The survey also found that 91% were concerned about the government's intent to keep the list of filtered websites a secret.|$|E
5|$|In May 2004, Trend Micro filed a legal {{complaint}} against Fortinet alleging that its antivirus technology infringed Trend Micro's patents on methods for scanning email and internet traffic. That August the International Trade Commission ruled against Fortinet, prohibiting {{the sale of}} affected products. Fortinet said Trend Micro's patents were <b>too</b> <b>broad,</b> but it complied with the ruling. Fortinet and Trend Micro reached an agreement with undisclosed terms in January 2006 and Fortinet modified its antivirus products to avoid Trend Micro's patents.|$|E
50|$|In his view, {{the badge}} {{requirement}} directly regulated {{the content of}} speech, and was <b>too</b> overly <b>broad</b> to satisfy narrow tailoring. In addition, the compelling government interest at hand, the prevention of fraud and misconduct, had not been sufficiently shown to exist as a real problem.|$|R

5|$|The FEPP {{conducted}} a survey in 2001 which revealed that online monitoring software, including Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cybersitter, cast <b>too</b> <b>broad</b> a net and often blocked legitimate educational websites {{in their attempts to}} censor material from youths. In 2003, the organization assisted 33 academics in filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted the sale of violent video games to minors. In coordination with the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP released a public policy report in 2006 on the inefficiency of Internet filtering; the report concluded that freedom of expression was harmed by such online censorship activity. In 2007, the FEPP became an independent organization.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; many felt {{that while the}} episode had an interesting theme and {{that much of the}} drama was successful, the humor was <b>too</b> <b>broad</b> or forced. The episode was viewed by 3.44 million viewers and received a 1.8/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, though it was lowest rated episode of The Office at the time of airing.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who appreciated the {{improvements in the}} accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list {{was considered to be}} <b>too</b> <b>broad,</b> and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.|$|E

50|$|At {{the eastern}} end, a branch to the {{important}} city of Wells was opened on 15 March 1859. This {{had originally been}} planned {{to be part of}} a main line extension towards Frome, where the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway could be joined, giving the yearned-for access to the South Coast towns, but by now the Somerset Central thought that joining up with the Dorset Central Railway would be a more cost-effective option. Wells therefore was a branch line only, with the station at Priory Road. It <b>too</b> was <b>broad</b> gauge, and one intermediate station at Polsham was opened in 1861.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, the Free Expression Policy Project {{assisted}} 33 academics {{specializing in}} journalism, with filing a friend-of-the-court brief challenging a law which restricted {{the sale of}} violent video games to youths. In 2004 the organization operated at the National Coalition Against Censorship. In 2005 the organization {{was part of the}} Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Within the Brennan Center for Justice, the FEPP operated through the Democracy Program at the law school. In 2006 the organization, in collaboration with the Brennan Center for Justice, released a report on the inefficiency of Internet filtering. The 87-page report concluded that academic-based censorship of material on the Internet was far <b>too</b> <b>broad</b> and harmed free expression of ideas. The FEPP became independent from both the National Coalition Against Censorship and the Brennan Center for Justice in 2007.|$|E
5|$|She {{was sent}} to Portsmouth {{after the end of}} the war where she was made {{available}} to investigate the cause of her sister ship Glattons magazine explosion. She was moved to Devonport as a temporary tender to the stone frigate Vivid in April 1919. She was paid off on 31 August and joined the Reserve Fleet in September. She was offered back to the Norwegians, but they rejected her as unsuitable to their requirements, especially since she was now <b>too</b> <b>broad</b> for their dock at Horten. Several attempts were made to sell her, but she was disarmed in 1922 and used as a target ship to evaluate the effects of bombs bursting underwater near a ship and the effects of six-inch gunfire. She was finally sold for scrap on 26 August 1928 and broken up at the former naval dockyard at Pembroke.|$|E

30|$|Color {{optimization}} has a {{lower rate}} than the design optimization. Due to {{a wider variety of}} colors, their scoring range is <b>broader,</b> <b>too.</b> Consequently, more generations are necessary in this instance. Moreover, automatic scoring of repeated designs helps the software performs faster. One of the significant aspects of this software is the existence of a variable database which can make a better optimization and increase design range size.|$|R

5|$|The case of Epiphyllum is complex. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus {{created the}} genus Cactus. As more species were {{discovered}} this proved <b>too</b> <b>broad,</b> and new genera {{were set up}} to subdivide the cacti. The genus Epiphyllum was created in 1812 by Haworth, based on Linnaeus's Cactus phyllanthus. In 1831 Johann Link created the genus Phyllocactus {{based on the same}} species. Following Ludwig Pfeiffer in 1837, the European tradition was to use Phyllocactus for epiphytic cacti with large regular flowers and Epiphyllum for the irregular-flowered species now called Schlumbergera truncata. Under modern rules, Phyllocactus is an illegitimate name, as is Epiphyllum in the sense of Pfeiffer; thus Epiphyllum Pfeiff. is a synonym of Schlumbergera. The true genus Epiphyllum Haw. now has around 19 species.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of Section (V) is ambiguous, which led some critics {{to worry that}} the language was <b>too</b> <b>broad,</b> potentially enabling students to circumvent copyright to access books, films, and music for coursework, or allowing professors to create course packs without obtaining permission from publishers.|$|E
25|$|Turning to shame, Nussbaum {{argues that}} shame takes <b>too</b> <b>broad</b> a target, {{attempting}} to inculcate humiliation on a scope {{that is too}} intrusive and limiting on human freedom.

2500|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), {{which was}} {{headquartered}} in Philadelphia, acquired tunnel rights from the Schuylkill River to 15th Street {{from the city}} of Philadelphia in return for land that the city needed to construct the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. This allowed the company to build both Suburban Station and the 30th Street Station, which replaced [...] Broad Street Station as the latter was <b>too</b> small. <b>Broad</b> St. Station was a stub-end terminal in Center City and through trains had to back in and out, and the company wanted a location which would accommodate trains between New York City and Washington.

(Because of the Depression and World War II, Broad St. Station didn't close until 1952.) ...|$|R
50|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{were built}} in India in early years as they cost less to build as they were usually lighter in construction, used smaller cars and locomotives (smaller loading gauge), as well as smaller bridges, smaller tunnels (smaller structure gauge) and tighter curves.

It was also used in sparsely populated areas where the potential demand was <b>too</b> low for <b>broader</b> gauge railways to be economically viable.|$|R

60|$|Not a {{human being}} was out of doors at the dairy. The denizens were all enjoying the usual {{afternoon}} nap of {{an hour or so}} which the exceedingly early hours kept in summer-time rendered a necessity. At the door the wood-hooped pails, sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings, hung like hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed there for that purpose; all of them ready and dry for the evening milking. Angel entered, and went through the silent passages of the house to the back quarters, where he listened for a moment. Sustained snores came from the cart-house, where some of the men were lying down; the grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further distance. The large-leaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept <b>too,</b> their <b>broad</b> limp surfaces hanging in the sun like half-closed umbrellas.|$|R
60|$|To define Azuma-zi {{was beyond}} ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid than {{anything}} else, though {{his hair was}} curly rather than frizzy, and his nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black, and the whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheek-bones and narrow chin gave his face something of the viperine V. His head, <b>too,</b> was <b>broad</b> behind, and low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in the reverse way to a European's. He was short of stature and still shorter of English. In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known marketable value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs, and--especially after whiskey--lectured to him against superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however, shirked the discussion of his gods, {{even though he was}} kicked for it.|$|R

25|$|The primary {{model of}} {{contemporary}} mainstream Western psychiatry is the biopsychosocial model (BPS), which merges biological, {{psychological and social}} factors.

It may be commonly neglected or misapplied in practice due to being <b>too</b> <b>broad</b> or relativistic, however.|$|E

25|$|The first {{train to}} run via the {{entirety}} of the line was a test train that operated on June 15, 1915. The trip used the local tracks as the express tracks were not yet completed. A trial trip that ran earlier in the day ripped a piece off of the platform at DeKalb Avenue as it was <b>too</b> <b>broad.</b> At this time, the line was scheduled to be inaugurated with a ceremonial trip on June 19, before being opened to the public on June 21. However, the opening was delayed a day to June 22, 1915, when the line opened from the Manhattan Bridge through to the Sea Beach Line. The ceremonial trip took place three days prior. Initially, service only ran via the Nassau Loop tracks to Chambers Street as the new subway under Broadway was not yet open. Construction on the initial portion of the line cost about $30,000,000.|$|E
