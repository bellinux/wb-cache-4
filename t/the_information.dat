To utilize <b>the</b> local <b>information</b> and <b>the</b> nonlocal <b>information</b> simultaneously and utilize them distinctively, a new feature extraction approach called weighted linear embedding (WLE) is pro-posed by using the Gaussian weighting. Further, a method to set the optimal parameter of the Gaussian weighting is put forward.
