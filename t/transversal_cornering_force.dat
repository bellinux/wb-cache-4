40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to study the effect of various parameters on the <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> produced by a rolling aircraft tire installed on a tilted, free-swiveling nose gear. The parameters studied included tilt angle, trial, tire inflation pressure, rake angle, vertical load, {{and whether or not}} a twin tire configuration corotates. These parameters were evaluated by measuring the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> produced by an aircraft tire installed on the nose gear of a modified vehicle as it was towed slowly. <b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficient increased with increasing tilt angle. Increasing trial or rake angle decreased the magnitude of the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficient. Tire inflation pressure had no effect on the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficient. Increasing vertical load decreased the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficient. When the tires of a twin tire system rotated independently, the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficients were the same as those for the single-tire configuration. When the twin tire system was made to corotate, however, the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficients increased significantly...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> is {{the lateral}} (i.e. {{parallel}} to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tyre during <b>cornering.</b> <b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> coefficients of motorcycle tyres tends to decrease with increased vertical load, increased inflation pressure, and increased temperature.|$|R
50|$|While {{the tread}} element {{moves through the}} contact patch it is {{deflected}} further from the wheel mid-plane. This deflection {{gives rise to the}} slip angle, and to the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> The rate at which the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> builds up is described by the relaxation length.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effects of pavement surface condition on the <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> developed by a group of 6. 50 x 13 automobile tires of different tread design was conducted at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility. The tests were made at fixed yaw angles of 3, 4. 5, and 6 deg at forward speeds up to 80 knots on two concrete surfaces of different texture under dry, damp, and flooded conditions. The results showed that the <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> were extremely sensitive to tread pattern and runway surface texture under all conditions and that under flooded conditions tire hydroplaning and complete loss of <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> occurred at a forward velocity predicted from an existing formula based on tire inflation pressure. Futher, tests on the damp concrete with a smooth tire and a four-groove tire showed higher <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> at a yaw angle of 3 deg than at 4. 5 deg; this indicated that maximum <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> are developed at extremely small steering angles under these conditions...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> is {{generated}} by tire slip and is proportional to slip angle at low slip angles. The rate at which <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> builds up is described by relaxation length. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire contact patch, and this deflection of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring.|$|R
50|$|The diagram is {{misleading}} because the reaction force {{would appear to}} be acting in the wrong direction. It is simply a matter of convention to quote positive <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> as acting in the opposite direction to positive tire slip so that calculations are simplified, since a vehicle cornering under the influence of a <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> to the left will generate a tire slip to the right.|$|R
50|$|Relaxation length {{describes}} the delay between when a slip angle is introduced {{and when the}} <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> reaches its steady-state value.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cornering</b> <b>force</b> or {{side force}} is the lateral (i.e. {{parallel}} to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.|$|R

50|$|Relaxation {{length is}} a {{property}} of pneumatic tires {{that describes the}} delay between when a slip angle is introduced and when the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> reaches its steady-state value.It is also described as the distance that a tire rolls before the lateral force builds up to 63% of its steady-state value.It can be calculated as the ratio of cornering stiffness over the lateral stiffness, wherecornering stiffness is the ratio of <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> over slip angle, andlateral stiffness is the ratio of lateral force over lateral displacement.|$|R
5000|$|As with {{deformation}} of a spring, {{deformation of}} the tire contact patch generates a reaction {{force in the}} tire; the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> Although the term, [...] "tread element" [...] is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance {{is a factor in}} tire construction and inflation pressure.|$|R
50|$|Untripped rollovers {{occur when}} <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> destabilize the vehicle. As a vehicle rounds a <b>corner,</b> three <b>forces</b> act on it: tire forces (the {{centripetal}} force), inertial effects (the centrifugal force), and gravity. The <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> from the tire push the vehicle towards {{the center of}} the curve. This force acts at ground level, below the center of mass. The force of inertia acts horizontally through the vehicle's center of mass away from {{the center of the}} turn. These two forces make the vehicle roll towards the outside of the curve. The force of the vehicle's weight acts downward through the center of mass in the opposite direction. When the tire and inertial forces are enough to overcome the force of gravity, the vehicle starts to turn over.|$|R

5000|$|In vehicle dynamics, {{slip angle}} or {{sideslip}} angle is the angle between a rolling wheel's actual {{direction of travel}} and the direction towards which it is pointing (i.e., {{the angle of the}} vector sum of wheel forward velocity [...] and lateral velocity [...] ). For a free-rolling wheel this slip angle results in a force parallel to the axle and the component of the force perpendicular to the wheel's direction of travel is the <b>cornering</b> <b>force.</b> This <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> increases approximately linearly for the first few degrees of slip angle, then increases non-linearly to a maximum before beginning to decrease.|$|R

50|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of mountain biking can be greatly reduced by not riding on wet or sensitive trails, keeping speeds modest so as to minimize <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> and braking forces, not skidding, and by staying on the trail.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} {{pneumatic}} tires, bicycle tires generate <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> that varies with slip angle and camber thrust that varies with camber angle. These {{forces have been}} measured by several researchers since the 1970s, and {{have been shown to}} influence bicycle stability.|$|R
50|$|Short spindle SLAs tend {{to require}} stiffer {{bushings}} at the body, as the braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>forces</b> are higher. Also {{they tend to}} have poorer kingpin geometry, due to the difficulty of packaging the upper ball joint and the brakes inside the wheel.|$|R

30|$|In {{equilateral}} polygons, the superposed corners {{are independent}} of each other, but they are inscribed in the same circle. However, in natural pores, the cross sections are more irregular, and the complex structure of the polygonal <b>corners</b> <b>forces</b> the fluid distributions to be more complicated.|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic {{trail is}} a trail-like effect {{generated}} by compliant tyres rolling {{on a hard}} surface and subject to side loads, as in a turn. It is the distance that the resultant <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> of side-slip occurs behind the geometric centre of the contact patch.|$|R
50|$|There is {{risk with}} trail braking because {{excessive}} use of the front brake {{can result in a}} loss of grip as the tire's adhesion is split between braking and <b>cornering</b> <b>forces.</b> Effective trail braking requires finesse from the rider, which can be difficult to learn.|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of four model aircraft tires of various construction were evaluated experimentally and compared with available theory. The experimental investigation consisted of measuring the <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> and the self-aligning torque {{developed by the}} tires undergoing sinusoidal steering inputs while operating on a small scale, road-wheel tire testing apparatus. The force and moment data from the different tires are compared with both finite- and point-contact patch string theory predictions. In general, agreement between finite contact patch theory and experimental observation is good. A modified string theory is also presented in which coefficients for <b>cornering</b> <b>force</b> and self-aligning torque are determined separately. This theory improves the correspondence between the experimental and analytical data, particularly on tires with relatively high self-aligning torques...|$|R

Based on the {{production}} practice of boron microalloyed medium-carbon steel, oscillating curve, cooling water flow in mould, secondary cooling system and arc alignment precision, rolling gap precision on <b>transversal</b> <b>corner</b> crack in slab was analyzed, and the corresponding control measures were put forward.
