5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|Each {{captain had}} {{different}} interpretations of The Rule of the Road believing his ship {{had the right}} of way. Captain John Boutwood of the Curacoa kept to the liner's mean course <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> his ability to defend the liner from enemy aircraft, while Commodore Sir Cyril G. Illingworth of Queen Mary continued their zig-zag pattern expecting the escort cruiser to give way.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located {{at the entrance to the}} stacks <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, I-75 through Detroit was completed, and two {{additional}} sections of M-76 {{were converted to}} freeway. The northern section ran from the US27-to-I-75 transition south of Grayling to the Crawford–Roscommon county line, and the second was an extension from Alger to the West Branch area. The first ice-detection system in the state was installed on the River Rouge bridges in the Detroit area in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> driver safety.|$|E
5|$|Murray had {{designed}} {{a car for}} the 1979 season called the BT47 that had a Chaparral 2J-type box rear end with twin variable geometry fans on the rear <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> ground effect. The car was never built due to the FIA closing the loophole in the regulations for the 1979 season.|$|E
5|$|Rome's revenue equaled {{the amount}} of the {{successful}} bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.|$|E

5|$|The Arabs {{hoped that}} the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already {{established}} contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general intended to use the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The XF4H-1 was {{designed}} to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45° and was equipped with blown flaps for better low-speed handling.|$|E
5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> food intake. This theory has been tested by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E

5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often disregarding the quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E
5|$|Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, {{including}} a penthouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side and a trophy girlfriend, interior decorator Darien (Daryl Hannah). Bud is promoted {{to a senior}} stockbroker {{as a result of}} the large commission fees he is bringing in from Gekko's trading, and is given a corner office with a view. He continues <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> inside information and use friends as straw buyers to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|E

5|$|Evans used a woodblock {{printing}} technique known as chromoxylography, {{which was used}} primarily for inexpensive serialised books and children's books requiring few colours, so as <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> profits. However, chromoxylography allowed a variety of hues and tones to be produced by mixing colours. The process was complicated and required intricate engraving to achieve the best results. Evans possessed a meticulous eye for detail and used a hand-press {{and as many as}} a dozen colour blocks for a single image. He {{went on to become the}} preeminent wood engraver and colour printer in Britain during the second half of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{defeated}} Virginia Tech, 2722 in {{the first}} ACC Championship game. Following the 2005 game, the ACC requested that ABC schedule the 2006 contest for the afternoon in order <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> television ratings. Heading into the 2006 college football season, Florida State and Miami were picked in the annual ACC pre-season media poll as favorites {{to appear in the}} 2006 ACC Championship Game. Georgia Tech received the third-most votes on the Coastal Division side of the poll, while Wake Forest was picked to finish last in the Atlantic Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} Democratic party whip, serving under party leader Lyndon B. Johnson. In addition, he retained his {{chairmanship of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee for the 1954 election cycle. He and Democratic National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell agreed that the two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations in order <b>to</b> <b>maximize</b> donations for Democratic candidates. Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having his committee provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E
