5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as <b>tidal</b> <b>lock.</b> Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Kelston Lock and weir have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the lock and weir. The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last <b>tidal</b> <b>lock,</b> after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E
5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow <b>Tidal</b> <b>Lock</b> was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E
5000|$|Note however {{that how}} quickly <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> occurs can depend upon a planets oceans and even atmosphere, and {{may mean that}} <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> fails to happen even after many gigayears. Additionally <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> {{is not the only}} {{possible}} end state of tidal dampning. Mercury for example has had sufficient time to tidally lock, but is in a 3:2 spin orbit resonance.|$|R
30|$|Studies of {{the ozone}} {{concentration}} of a tidally locked planet would need to account for both {{the effects of the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> and the altered stellar irradiance spectrum. This would complicate the cause–effect attribution analysis, making the attribution of the changes in the ozone distribution to either the <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> or the altered UV radiation exceedingly challenging. We therefore did not include the effects of the altered UV radiation in our study and focused only on the magnitude of the impact of <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> on the Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star.|$|R

500|$|Prior to the work, the {{arrangement}} {{had been to}} regulate the navigation with the Pond Lane Flood Gates and Marshgate Lane <b>tidal</b> <b>lock.</b> The new lock at Carpenter's Road gave access to the Waterworks River, providing barge access to Temple Mills. At high tides, the low headroom of the Northern Outfall Sewer aqueduct prevented access to the southern reaches of the system, and to allow access City Mill Lock was constructed near Blaker Road. [...] In 2005, the lock was partially restored {{as part of the}} planning gain required from the developers of the adjacent Bellamy Homes housing scheme.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{its small}} {{separation}} from Gliese 581, the planet has been {{generally considered to}} always have one hemisphere facing the star (only day), and the other always facing away (only night), or in other words being tidally locked. [...] The most recent orbital fit to the system, taking stellar activity into account indicates a circular orbit, but older fits use an eccentricity between 0.10 and 0.22. If the orbit of the planet were eccentric, it would undergo violent tidal flexing. Because tidal forces are stronger when the planet {{is close to the}} star, eccentric planets are expected to have a rotation period which is shorter than its orbital period, also called pseudo-synchronization. An example of this effect is seen in Mercury, which is tidally locked in a 3:2 resonance, completing three rotations every two orbits. In any case, even in the case of 1:1 <b>tidal</b> <b>lock,</b> the planet would undergo libration and the terminator would be alternatively lit and darkened during libration.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>tidal</b> <b>lock</b> is {{generally}} any lock that connects tidal with non-tidal water.

2500|$|Denver sluice was reconstructed in 1834, {{after the}} Eau Brink Cut had been completed. [...] Sir John Rennie {{designed}} the new structure, which incorporated a <b>tidal</b> <b>lock</b> with {{four sets of}} gates, enabling it to be used at most states of the tide. [...] Sir Thomas Cullam, who had inherited a part share of the upper river, invested large amounts {{of his own money}} in rebuilding the locks, sluices and staunches in the 1830s and 1840s. The South Level Drainage and Navigation Act of 1827 created Commissioners who dredged the river from Hermitage Lock to Littleport bridge, and also dredged several of its tributaries. They constructed a new cut near Ely to bypass a long meander near Padnall Fen and Burnt Fen, but although the works cost £70,000, they were too late to return the navigation to prosperity. Railways arrived in the area rapidly after 1845, reaching Cambridge, Ely, Huntingdon, King's Lynn, St Ives, St Neots and Tempsford by 1850. The river below King's Lynn was improved by the construction of the [...] Marsh Cut and the building of training walls beyond that to constrain the channel, but the railways were welcomed by the Bedford Levels Corporation, for whom navigation interfered with drainage, and by King's Lynn Corporation, {{who did not want to}} be superseded by other towns with railway interchange facilities.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results show}} that the {{majority}} of the changes in the middle atmospheric circulation appear due to the <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> which results in the breakdown of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The vertical circulation is replaced by a dayside downwelling, centred on the subsolar point and a nightside upwelling, centred on the antisolar point. The <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> also alters the horizontal wind at all altitudes, resulting in lower wind speeds, wider and stronger jet streams and the appearance of large scale vortices at various locations compared to the PDE, possibly due to the reduced Coriolis force of the TLE.|$|R
50|$|An eyeball {{planet is}} a {{hypothetical}} type of tidally locked planet, for which <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> induces spatial features (for {{example in the}} geography or composition of the planet) resembling an eyeball.

This temperature gradient will therefore limit the places in which liquid may exist {{on the surface of}} the planet to ring or disk shaped areas.|$|R

Along the way, the canal passed through Savannah’s 19th century industrial corridor, former rice fields, timber tracts, and a still lush tidal river swamp and adjacent sandhill environment that is the characteristic habitat for several unique species of flora and fauna. Nowadays much of this area comprises the Savannah suburbs of Garden City and Pooler. The canal was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 1997.|$|E
50|$|For most planets, the {{rotation}} period and axial tilt (also called obliquity) are not known, {{but a large}} number of planets have been detected with very short orbits (where tidal effects are greater) that will probably have reached an equilibrium rotation that can be predicted (i.e. <b>tidal</b> <b>lock,</b> spin-orbit resonances, and non-resonant equilibria such as retrograde rotation).|$|E
50|$|Any planet or moon with a {{sufficient}} axial tilt that rotates {{with respect to}} its star significantly more frequently than it orbits the star (no <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> between the two) will experience the same phenomenon (a nighttime lasting more than one rotation period).|$|R
5000|$|Tidal effects become {{particularly}} pronounced near small {{bodies of}} high mass, such as neutron stars or black holes, {{where they are}} responsible for the [...] "spaghettification" [...] of infalling matter. Tidal forces create the oceanic tide of Earth's oceans, where the attracting bodies are the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. Tidal forces are also responsible for <b>tidal</b> <b>locking,</b> <b>tidal</b> acceleration, and tidal heating. Tides may also induce seismicity.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause <b>tidal</b> <b>locking,</b> {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such <b>tidal</b> <b>locking</b> was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|R
