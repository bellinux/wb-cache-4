50|$|Best safety {{requires}} that the chain is properly sharpened. One key sharpening parameter is the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> setting. The <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is the small steel protuberance {{in front of each}} cutting tooth. The difference in height between the leading cutting edge and the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> determines the thickness of the wood chip taken by the cutter. If the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is too low, the cutter takes too deep a bite from the wood, the saw becomes difficult to control and the chances of kickback increase.|$|R

5000|$|Chain design plays a {{major part}} in {{kickback}} reduction. Older, non-safety designs carried only teeth and <b>depth</b> <b>gauges.</b> Since these present a solid leading edge at the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> should an object be suddenly forced into the chain, they can easily be made to engage fully with the foreign body and launch into a full kickback. Careful filing of the <b>depth</b> <b>gauges,</b> making a radius down to the leading edge, reduces the risk somewhat. Newer chains with ramped drive links {{fill in the gap}} ahead of the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge,</b> reducing the tendency to grab still further. Full safety chains have extra bumper links between the cutting links, maintaining nearly full <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> height along {{the full extent of the}} chain and reducing the risk of kickback to very low levels. Full safety (bumpered) chains are often fitted as original equipment to domestic and entry level saws. Modern [...] "professional" [...] chains offer far higher cutting performance than full safety chain, and offset their increased risk with an assumption of a much higher degree of operator competence. In reality they are still safer than traditional chains due to the vastly improved <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> design, with a deep ramp ahead of the gauge point.|$|R

40|$|Non-uniformity {{of steps}} within a flight {{is a major}} risk factor for falls. Guidelines and {{requirements}} for uniformity of step risers and <b>tread</b> <b>depths</b> assume the measurement system provides precise dimensional values. The state-of-the-art measurement system {{is a relatively new}} method, known as the nosing-to-nosing method. It involves measuring the distance between the noses of adjacent steps and the angle formed with the horizontal. From these measurements, the effective riser height and <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> are calculated. This study was undertaken for the purpose of evaluating the measurement system to determine how much of total measurement variability comes from the step variations versus that due to repeatability and reproducibility (R 2 ̆ 6 R) associated with the measurers. Using an experimental design quality control professionals call a measurement system experiment, two measurers measured all steps in six randomly selected flights, and repeated the process on a subsequent day. After marking each step in a flight in three lateral places (left, center, and right), the measurers took their measurement. This process yielded 774 values of riser height and 672 values of <b>tread</b> <b>depth.</b> Results of applying the Gage R 2 ̆ 6 R ANOVA procedure in Minitab software indicated that the R 2 ̆ 6 R contribution to riser height variability was 1. 42...|$|R

The European commission has posted a tender aimed to study what measures on a European level can be taken {{in relation to the}} use of tyres to improve road safety. The results of this study, supported by a cost benefit analyses and carried out by TNO and TML, are described in this report. The study considers the use of Winter tyres, <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> requirements, tyre inflation pressure maintenance and tyre ageing effects and damages. An assessment has been made of the tyre safety performance, current use of tyre and consumer awareness, tyre related accident statistics and existing regulations for the different tyre aspects (including TPMS). Results from analyses on accident records from Germany (GIDAS) and a NHTSA study provide estimation of safety benefits. Policy options are defined and estimations are made of the accident reduction on a European scale to assess the monetary benefits, which are compared to the associated cost of execution of the policies. The results indicate that extended enforcement of <b>tread</b> <b>depth</b> regulation and increase of tyre pressure maintenance are most cost effective.

50|$|The hydrolevel device used {{in recent}} Voronja expeditions {{comprises}} a 50 m transparent tube filled with water, which is coiled or {{placed on a}} reel. A rubber glove which acts as a reservoir is placed {{on one end of}} the tube, and a metal box with a transparent window is placed on the other. A diver's digital wristwatch with a <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> function is submerged in the box. If the rubber glove is placed on one station and the box with the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> is placed on a lower one, then the hydrostatic pressure between the two points depends only on the difference in heights and the density of the water, i.e. the route of the tube does not affect the pressure in the box. Reading the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> gives the apparent depth change between the higher and lower station. Depth changes are 'apparent' because <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> are calibrated for sea water, and the hydrolevel is filled with fresh water. Therefore, a coefficient must be determined to convert apparent depth changes to true depth changes. Adding the readings for consecutive pairs of stations gives the total depth of the cave.|$|R

40|$|Maintenance {{operations}} on ITER tokamak components will be largely performed by remote handling. In previous work {{it was shown}} that representative maintenance tasks could be performed significantly faster with direct visual feedback than with camera feedback. In post-test interviews, operators indicated that they regarded the lack of 3 D perception as the primary factor hindering their performance. This paper discusses various techniques to improve depth perception in teleoperation, including stereo vision, head tracking, virtual camera views and <b>depth</b> <b>gauges.</b> The most promising techniques were tested. Performance metrics included time-to-complete, path analysis and operator work-load. In a first experiment, artificial <b>depth</b> <b>gauges</b> views were tested in a 1 : 1 scale hardware testbed with mechanical master-slave manipulators handled by experienced operators. Robust real-time image processing was achieved with marker-based objects. The simple <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> and graphical overlay did not significantly improve task performance. Operators commented on {{their view of the}} task being “obstructed” by the graphical overlay, and the <b>depth</b> <b>gauge</b> was judged not very informative.

The friction coefficient is expressed as the product of a 'dry' friction coefficient by a function expressing the actions of water. It was stated that this function is a product of four weighting functions expressing respectively the water intrusion - due to the speed and the water depth - and the water drainage - thanks to the road surface macrotexture and the tire <b>tread</b> <b>depth.</b> It was shown that existing friction models are a special case of the proposed model. The model was calibrated by friction measurements issued from an exhaustive test campaign conducted at Ifsttar's test track. The test program includes 2 commercial tire types, 3 road surfaces, 6 speeds, 3 water depths and 3 tire <b>tread</b> <b>depths.</b> It was shown that the model fits remarkably well experimental data, except for very high water depth (8 mm) at high speed (over 80 km/h). Considering the fact that these conditions induce mechanisms like dragging that are not considered in the model and that the water depths used by friction monitoring devices generally are lower than 1 mm, it was considered that the proposed model is satisfactory. Discussions are made in terms of using the model for monitoring purposes or for harmonization of friction devices...|$|R
