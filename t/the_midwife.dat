25|$|The actual {{duties of}} <b>the</b> <b>midwife</b> in antiquity {{consisted}} mainly of assisting in the birthing process, {{although they may}} also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, <b>the</b> <b>midwife</b> would call for {{the assistance of a}} physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases <b>the</b> <b>midwife</b> brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. <b>The</b> <b>midwife</b> sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards {{on the top of the}} mother's abdomen.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this Bachelor Thesis is Support of Fathers? Attendance at Midwifery. The Thesis is {{dividend}} in two parts, {{theoretical and practical}} ones. The theoretical part concentrates on the father?s role within the pregnancy {{and in the course}} of delivery, on <b>the</b> <b>midwife?s</b> care during <b>the</b> delivery as well as on both laymen and professionals? opinions on the fathers? attendance at delivery. Nowadays, fathers? birth attendance appears quite a common thing, which did not use to be obvious in the past. However, we can meet with various views of the matter. The first aim of the research investigation was to ascertain <b>the</b> <b>midwive?s</b> opinion on fathers? birth attendance, and the way they support those fathers attending the birth. The second aim was to ascertain how much the fathers were satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>midwive?s</b> support. So as to reach these aims, the qualitative research investigation in the form of semi-structured interviews was adopted. The research sample was made up by eight <b>midwives</b> from <b>the</b> Maternity Unit of the Hospital in Třebíč, and eleven randomly chosen partners/fathers attended the births in this Hospital. The data collected from the interviews were processed via the quantitative analysis. It was ascertained that <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> had a positive approach towards the fathers? birth attendance, and they preferred cooperation with those partners/fathers who had not been made to their attendance in any way. <b>The</b> <b>midwives</b> expressed their support for the partners/fathers attended in form of their communication with both of the expectant parents, and not forcing the partners they tried to involve them in the delivery process. Fathers/partners mentioned that they did not feel to be a burden but a part of the team. Concerning <b>the</b> <b>midwive?s</b> support, most of the interviewed partners/fathers found it satisfactory. Only one of them did not need this support, he claimed it for his wife only. Other two of the interviewed fathers/partners did not feel the support of <b>the</b> <b>midwives.</b> <b>The</b> results of this research investigation could be used as the information material for <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> working at <b>the</b> delivery room, or for students studying this specialization, and for the expectant fathers as well...|$|R

The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, <b>the</b> <b>midwife</b> made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is to create a}} well-arranged and comprehensible review of the current status and possibilities of the prenatal diagnosis, as it nowadays represents an integral part of almost all pregnancies and many pregnant women decide whether to undergo a prenatal diagnosis and which method of the prenatal diagnosis should be employed in order to achieve a maximum guarantee that they will not give birth to a child with a defect. This thesis has a total of six aims. To find out if <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> are informed about possibilities of screening examinations in the pregnancy, whether they proceed in compliance with the recommendations of the Society for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during these examinations, whether the pregnant women according to <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> understand <b>the</b> meaning of the screening examinations, whether the pregnant women according to <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> are interested in performance of screening examinations in pregnancy and whether the pregnant women are interested in optional, above standard examinations that are not fully covered from the health insurance. In order to ascertain these aims, a total of six hypotheses were postulated on the grounds of which an anonymous questionnaire was created that was focused on evaluation of the theoretical knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> about possibilities of screening examinations in pregnancy and on evaluations of pregnant womens interest in these examinations based on the opinions of <b>the</b> <b>midwives.</b> <b>The</b> questionnaire contained a total of 26 questions.

40|$|Abstract Over {{the last}} decades it has become less common to become a teenage mother both in Norway and the other scandinavian countries. Even though there is {{extensive}} research concerning teenage pregnancy in european countries, questions concerning healthcare professionals approach to this marginal groups of pregnant women, has hardly been investigated in a scandinavian context. The aim of this qualitative study was to gain knowledge about midwives reflections about their profesional roles in caring for pregnant teenagers during prenatal care, and their understanding of young motherhood as a social phenomena. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} 10 <b>midwives</b> working in <b>the</b> public health care system in 7 different counties in Norway. Four categories were developed from <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> descriptions: structural factors determining <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> obligations, <b>the</b> relationship with the teeange mother, <b>the</b> <b>midwife’s</b> interpretation of her own role in caring for pregnant teenager, and preparing for change:the realistic mootherhood. By the use of existing theory these categories were further elaborated to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>midwives</b> role due to both academic and institutional changes, has been transformed and expanded from a primary orientation towards the individual pregnant adolescent, to include several concerns in what can be perceived as an ambigous intepretation of <b>the</b> <b>midwifes</b> professional role. Furthermore caring for a marginal group the shift between an individual or contextual oriented approach holds important implications about reflections on normality.
