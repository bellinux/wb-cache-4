The full concert video was subsequently released in 1999 on DVD and re-released again in 2007 with a Special Edition, which peaked at number 9 on the UK Video Charts.|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, {{all known}} {{naturally}} occurring codes are very similar. The coding mechanism is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> all organisms: three-base codons, tRNA, ribosomes, single direction reading and translating single codons into single amino acids.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, a local street, Durant Avenue, {{was renamed}} to Detective Russel Timoshenko Way in the detective's honor. Incidentally, {{following}} the controversial decision to rename a street to Sean Bell Way for police shooting victim Sean Bell, some community members had recommended doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> Timoshenko. However, {{the latter case}} had attracted much less media attention.|$|E
50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{population is}} highly mobile with only 39.2% of residents having lived at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> address <b>for</b> {{five years or}} longer. One in five residents (22.4%) have lived at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> address <b>for</b> under one year, and another one in four (25.3%) have lived at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> address <b>for</b> one to three years.|$|R
50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} population, {{according to}} the 2005 municipal census, is comparatively stable with just over half the residents (51.8%) having lived in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> residence <b>for</b> at least five years.

5|$|In each regulartuning, the musicalintervals are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> {{each pair}} of {{consecutive}} strings. Other regular tunings include all-fourths, augmented-fourths, and all-fifths tunings. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and advanced players' improvisation.|$|E
5|$|Premiums must be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> {{everyone}} {{of a given}} age, regardless of preexisting conditions. Premiums are allowed to vary by enrollee age, but those for the oldest enrollees (age 45–64 average expenses $5,542) can only be three times as large as those for adults (18–24 $1,836).|$|E
5|$|Sony {{announced}} {{before the}} PS3 launch in Europe that the PlayStation 2's Emotion Engine CPU would {{be removed from}} it for cost savings, and all backwards compatibility would be software-based.

5|$|The {{huge number}} of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it {{possible}} for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> coins dating from 350 onwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} benefit of {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E

5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> all {{the frequencies of}} the pulse) smears out over time, {{a process known as}} dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E
5|$|Although Paisley was now {{in charge}} of the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead them onto the pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> Leeds but Revie, who watched the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E

5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> all observers. Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E
5|$|Beginning to play {{organized}} hockey {{at the age}} of four, Hamhuis was {{competing against}} other players as old as eight years, as his hometown was not big enough to fill teams for younger age groups. He went to provincials four seasons in a row and won the title with his club, the Smithers Storm, in overtime during his last year of minor hockey. Future Predators teammate Cody Franson was a stick boy for Hamhuis' team, while another Nashville blueliner, Shea Weber, did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> a competing team at provincial tournaments. Hamhuis grew up cheering for the Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks.|$|E

5|$|Brunner {{returned}} {{to the mouth of}} the Buller River in March 1861 but this time aboard a ship. Working in much greater comfort than on his last visit to the area in 1848, with other members of his staff he surveyed and laid out sections for what would become the town of Westport. Later that month he did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> Greymouth. The work was soon completed and the party {{returned to}} Nelson in April 1861.|$|E
5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
5|$|Episode Two was {{developed}} simultaneously with Episode One by a development {{team led by}} David Speyrer. This schedule of simultaneous development aided them in streamlining the story between the two games to create an immersive story. The technology used was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> both games, allowing the development teams to quickly fix any technical problems that might arise from either game; this happened often because of the multi-platform release.|$|E
