5|$|Other images, such as Thalaba {{reclaiming}} his father's magic sword, are {{symbols that}} effectively reinforce Southey's moral themes. However, these events represent the {{minority of the}} plot and are rarely relied on early in the story. To the contrary, the heavily represented magic ring is used to protect Thalaba with little explanation as to how it works {{and there is no}} moral statements tied to its use. As a whole, the poem is able to portray scenery and events in strongly descriptive manners, but the manner in doing this <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their meaning and effect. In terms of religious imagery, Islam within the poem is more similar to Zoroastrian thought and morality. Other religious images lose their power as Southey removes any mystical aspects of them, including Simorgh being stripped of it being a symbol of harmony with life. In terms of the divine, there is a dual entity: Allah representing preservation and Eblis representing destruction. However, evil, though an opposite to good, is never explained but merely used to further the plot.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
25|$|According to Christopher B. Doob, {{outsourcing}} is companies' subcontracting {{of services}} to other companies instead of continuing to provide those services themselves. This <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> jobs offered in the United States and {{makes it more difficult}} to maintain and get jobs. Outsourcing raises the unemployment rate, and while outsourcing has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, data on the subject is limited by the power elite. Companies like Apple and Nike outsource jobs overseas so they can have cheaper labor to make their products and keep from raising prices in the States.|$|E

500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's [...] "expansive {{vocabulary}} and vivid imagination", adding that [...] "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make The Slim Shady LP {{one of the great}} debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album's [...] "unapologetic outrageousness" [...] as a reaction to the [...] "soul positivity" [...] of conscious hip hop, noting that [...] "The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch." [...] Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that [...] "He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" [...] but lamented the [...] "sometimes flat production that <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing for the New Statesman and Nation, Raymond Mortimer {{wrote that}} the panels [...] "seems served from Picasso's Crucifixion , but further distorted, with ostrich necks and button heads {{protruding}} from bags—the whole effect gloomily phallic, like Bosch without the humour.

I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies?

2500|$|These intersections {{with real}} economies remain controversial. Markets that {{capitalize}} in gaming are not widely {{accepted by the}} gaming industry. Reasons for this controversy are varied. [...] Firstly, the developers of the games often consider themselves as trying to present a fantasy experience, so the involvement of real world transactions <b>takes</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it. [...] Further, in most games, it would be unacceptable to offer another player real currency {{in order to have}} them play a certain way (e.g., in a game of Monopoly between friends, offering another player a real dollar in exchange for a property on the board); and for this to be necessary or valuable may indicate a Kingmaker scenario within the game. [...] However, such rules of etiquette need not apply, and in practice they often don't, to massive game worlds with thousands of players who know one another only through the game system.|$|E
2500|$|This {{version has}} been {{somewhat}} controversial, as Mamet chose to film it as a realist piece: the scene takes place in an actual theatre, and the principals are dressed as a director and his assistant might look. “When the director (D) made his peremptory demands for light from his female assistant (A) he received it not for his cigar, as in the original, but {{in the form of}} torchlight for his script. This weakened the sense of gratuitous offensiveness hanging about the character. D., played by Pinter, received rather too much camera attention and a patient John Gielgud rather too little, above all at the final moment” when he raises his head in defiance.
