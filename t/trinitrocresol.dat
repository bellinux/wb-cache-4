50|$|Ecrasite is an {{explosive}} material which is unaffected by moisture, shock or fire. It {{is a mixture}} of ammonium salts of cresol, phenol and various nitrocresols and nitrophenols principally <b>trinitrocresol</b> and picric acid. It was invented in 1888-1889 by Siersch and Kubin, and used in Austria-Hungary to load artillery shells.|$|E
5000|$|Japan {{followed}} with an [...] "improved" [...] formula known as shimose powder. In 1889, a similar material, {{a mixture of}} ammonium cresylate with <b>trinitrocresol,</b> or an ammonium salt of <b>trinitrocresol,</b> started to be manufactured under the name ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894, Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) {{was used by the}} United States beginning in 1906. Germany began filling artillery shells with TNT in 1902. Toluene was less readily available than phenol, and TNT is less powerful than picric acid, but the improved safety of munitions manufacturing and storage caused the replacement of picric acid by TNT for most military purposes between the World Wars. However, pure TNT was expensive to produce and most nations made some use of mixtures using cruder TNT and ammonium nitrate, some with other compounds included. These fills included Ammonal, Schneiderite and Amatol. The latter was still in wide use in World War II.|$|E
50|$|Ecrasite is {{a bright}} yellow solid. It is waxy to touch and melts at about 100 °C. When {{subjected}} to open flame, it burns without detonation, unless confined. It is insensitive to friction. It requires a detonator for initiation. Its general adoption was hindered by several unexplained explosions during loading into shells, {{which might have been}} caused by creation of unstable metal salts of <b>trinitrocresol</b> and/or trinitrophenol when the explosive came in contact with metals or alloys such as copper, brass (widely used for manufacturing detonator parts) and possibly other ones.|$|E
5000|$|Picric acid was {{the first}} high {{explosive}} nitrated organic compound widely considered suitable to withstand the shock of firing in conventional artillery. Nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose (guncotton) were available earlier but shock sensitivity sometimes caused detonation in the artillery barrel {{at the time of}} firing. In 1885, based on research of Hermann Sprengel, French chemist Eugène Turpin patented the use of pressed and cast picric acid in blasting charges and artillery shells. In 1887 the French government adopted a mixture of picric acid and guncotton under the name Melinite. In 1888, Britain started manufacturing a very similar mixture in Lydd, Kent, under the name Lyddite. Japan followed with an [...] "improved" [...] formula known as shimose powder. In 1889, a similar material, a mixture of ammonium cresylate with <b>trinitrocresol,</b> or an ammonium salt of <b>trinitrocresol,</b> started to be manufactured under the name ecrasite in Austria-Hungary. By 1894 Russia was manufacturing artillery shells filled with picric acid. Ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite or explosive D) was used by the United States beginning in 1906. However, shells filled with picric acid become highly unstable if the compound reacts with metal shell or fuze casings to form metal picrates which are more sensitive than the parent phenol. The sensitivity of picric acid was demonstrated in the Halifax Explosion. Picric acid was used in the Battle of Omdurman, Second Boer War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I.
