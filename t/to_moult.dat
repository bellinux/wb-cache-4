5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which {{are larger than}} those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E
5|$|Birds appear <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> {{once a year}} {{in spring}} or summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that anting is related <b>to</b> <b>moulting.</b> Correlation with moulting, however, may be attributable to the greater activity of ants in summer.|$|R

5|$|The young hatch {{after a few}} weeks, and {{typically}} have only three pairs of legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually moult, adding further segments and legs as they do so. Some species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although some species continue <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> after adulthood. Furthermore, some species alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures regress during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.|$|E
5|$|This species breeds in vegetated {{areas of}} {{freshwater}} lakes across Europe, Asia, Africa, northern South America and {{the southwest and}} western United States. After breeding, this bird migrates to saline lakes <b>to</b> <b>moult.</b> Then, after completing the moult and waiting for sometimes several months, it migrates to winter {{in places such as}} the south-western Palearctic and the eastern parts of both Africa and Asia. It also winters in southern Africa, another place where it breeds. In the Americas, it winters as far south as Guatemala, although the wintering population there is mainly restricted to islands in the Gulf of California, the Salton Sea, and Baja California. When not breeding, its habitat is primarily saline lakes and coastal estuaries.|$|E
5|$|Feathers become abraded {{over time}} and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are {{particularly}} dependent {{on their ability to}} fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.|$|E

50|$|This is a small-to-medium-sized, yellow-crested, {{black-and-white}} penguin, at 50 - 70 cm {{and weighing}} 2.5 - 6 kg.

25|$|Dense swarms can {{elicit a}} feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, {{especially}} near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy.|$|E
25|$|Larvae have 3 {{pairs of}} {{legs and the}} nymphs and adults 4 pairs. Ixodes holocyclus {{requires}} three hosts to complete its life cycle, thus it is a 'three-host tick'. <b>To</b> <b>moult</b> to the next stage a blood meal must be obtained by the larva or nymph. Moulting is known as ecdysis.|$|E
25|$|The female is {{identical}} in appearance {{to the male}} except that her lower mandible is orange-red with a black tip. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black. Feathers are moulted gradually between July and November with the main flight feathers taking 90–100 days <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> and regrow. Some that moult late may suspend their moult during cold winter weather.|$|E

25|$|Each {{stage of}} {{development}} between moults for insects in the taxon endopterygota is called an instar, or stadium, and each stage between moults of insects in the Exopterygota is called a nymph: there may be up to 15 nymphal stages.

Endopterygotes have more alternatives <b>to</b> <b>moulting,</b> such as expansion of the cuticle and collapse of air sacs to allow growth of internal organs.|$|R

25|$|At {{its most}} complete, a crustacean's life cycle {{begins with an}} egg, which is usually fertilised, but may instead be {{produced}} by parthenogenesis. This egg hatches into a pre-larva or pre-zoea. Through a series of moults, the young animal then passes through various zoea stages, followed by a megalopa or post-larva. This is followed by metamorphosis into an immature form, which broadly resembles the adult, and after further moults, the adult form is finally reached. Some crustaceans continue <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> as adults, while for others, the development of gonads signals the final moult.|$|E
25|$|The newly hatched nymph soon {{begins to}} feed and, {{if it is}} a gragarious individual, is {{attracted}} to other hoppers and they group together. As it grows it needs <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> (shed its exoskeleton). Is hard cuticle splits and its body expands while the new exoskeleton is still soft. The stages between moulting are called instars and the desert locust nymph undergoes five moults before becoming a winged adult. Immature and mature individuals in the gregarious phase individuals form bands which feed, bask and move as cohesive units, while solitary phase individuals do not seek gregariousness.|$|E
25|$|Fledgelings moult part {{of their}} {{juvenile}} plumage before their first winter, and the rest in spring. Adults moult on their breeding grounds before going on migration, or before the depth of winter if they are resident. Sometimes adults also seem <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> some feathers before attempting to breed. As moult requires a considerable investment of energy, some significant evolutionary benefits to offset this are likely. Reducing feather wear and parasite load, moulting can make a bird more physically attractive and healthy, and may thus increase its chance of successful reproduction. The phenomenon is not well understood, however.|$|E

25|$|Acrochordonichthys {{species are}} cryptically colored. The {{colouration}} is extremely variable, {{particularly in the}} A. rugosus group; colouration is less variable in the A. ischnosoma species group. Most have a light-brown saddle extending {{for the length of}} the adipose fin and some have spots {{on the side of the}} body in place of the saddle. Variation in colouration may be due <b>to</b> <b>moulting</b> of the skin. However, even though the colouration is highly variable, some general patterns are evident that allows colour to be a useful diagnostic character when variation is taken into account.|$|R
25|$|A {{parasitoid}} {{sooner or}} later kills its prey, so this form of parasitism is close to predation. Idiobiont parasitoid wasps sting their prey on capture, either killing them outright or paralyzing them immediately. The prey is then carried to a nest, an egg is laid on or in it, and the parasitoid develops rapidly. Koinobiont parasitoid wasps lay their eggs in young hosts, usually larvae, which are allowed to go on growing, so the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period. Some koinobionts regulate their host's development hormonally, for example preventing it from pupating or making it moult whenever the parasitoid is ready <b>to</b> <b>moult.</b>|$|E
25|$|The larva has 9 {{abdominal}} segments, but {{the number}} increases through moulting until the full adult number of 12 is reached. Further moults may occur, but do not add any more body segments, {{and it is not}} known whether the adults continue <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> through their lives. Eggs have only been observed in a few species. Five developmental stages follow: the prelarva hatches from the egg and has only weakly developed mouthparts and 9 abdominal segments; larva I follows and has fully developed mouthparts; larva II has ten abdominal segments; maturus junior has 12 abdominal segments and is followed by the adult. The family Acerentomidae differs in having an extra preimago stage, with partially developed genitalia, between the maturus junior and the adult.|$|E
25|$|It inhabits steppe to taiga and {{mountain}} valleys near freshwater, grazing on {{plants such as}} sedges (Cyperaceae), and rarely swimming. It forms small flocks outside the breeding season. In the winter, it grazes on plains and stubble fields, sometimes far from water. Birds return from the winter quarters around April, and the breeding season starts soon thereafter. It breeds as single pairs or loose groups near marshes and other wetlands, with nesting activity starting about May. The clutch is usually 5–6 but sometimes up to 8 eggs, which are laid in a shallow nest made from plants, placed directly on the ground, often on a small knoll to keep it dry. The precocial young hatch after about 28 days and become sexually mature at 2–3 years of age. Around late August/early September, the birds leave for winter quarters, where they gather in small groups <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> their worn plumage.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the mating habits and {{reproductive}} timing of the banded tunnelweb spider, as it has proven difficult to observe them mating inside their silk tunnel constructs. It is assumed that mating takes place inside the burrow of the female spider, although there are no reported sightings of the actual mating taking place. The actual mating of the spiders is assumed to happen in the same fashion as it does with other closely related mygalomorphs. There has been one recorded sighting of the behaviors leading up to mating, although the actual mating was unsuccessful; it was observed that as the male approached the female’s burrow he outstretched his front pair of legs, exposing his reproductive organs, then whilst vibrating his outstretched legs he moved toward the female. In this instance the female was unresponsive to the male’s advances, and nothing eventuated from the encounter. When a female is impregnated she lays her eggs in early to mid summer, wrapping them in a loose silk egg sack that is stored near the entrance of her burrow. In approximately thirty days the spiderlings hatch and stay nearby in the mother's web before leaving to construct their own silky tunnel web close by. There is a lack of information on the actual lifespan of the spiders, although the lifespan of the males and females differ greatly. Once leaving their mother the males only have a matter of months to find a mate before they die, but females have been known to live up to six years in captivity, being able <b>to</b> <b>moult</b> their skin and reproduce multiple times.|$|E
