5|$|Isotope {{studies have}} {{established}} that the lake has long had a permanent ice cover. Further, studies carried out during the austral summer confirm the lake's homogeneous characteristics, with <b>thermal</b> <b>convection</b> as the reason given for its hydro-geochemical and isotropical nature. It is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice. It is also stated that the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a melt-water pond.|$|E
5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of energy transfer. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of <b>thermal</b> <b>convection.</b> Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E

25|$|Gel {{electrophoresis}} uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or {{sieving medium}} during electrophoresis, {{the movement of}} a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the <b>thermal</b> <b>convection</b> caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but {{may be used as}} a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the <b>thermal</b> <b>convection</b> currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just {{that portion of the}} envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the Edison effect, thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{rainfall}} regime {{is generated by}} two factors: general atmospheric circulation, physical and geographical conditions, respectively. Advection of temperate oceanic air from west and north-west direction, especially during the summer, as well as frequent ingress of cold air masses from the north or those temperate continental from north-east and east, during the winter, plus advection of maritime tropical air from the south-west and south, explain all influences of atmospheric action centres which are felt in this area. Taking into account these elements, plus relief influences, atmospheric rainfall are unevenly spread across the county. The average amount of precipitation is 600–700mm, in Zalău being 634.2mm (calculated for the period 1961–1990). The most abundant precipitation falls in summer, when besides frontal processes occurs the intense <b>thermal</b> <b>convection,</b> causing showers, rich in terms of quantity. During the winter, rainfall is less quantitatively, {{although the number of}} days with precipitation is not smaller. By and large, the pluviometric maximum overlaps the months of May–June, and the pluviometric minimum is registered in January–February.|$|E

500|$|The {{bald eagle}} is a {{powerful}} flier, and soars on <b>thermal</b> <b>convection</b> currents. It reaches speeds of [...] when gliding and flapping, and about [...] while carrying fish. Its dive speed is between , though it seldom dives vertically. Regarding their flying abilities, the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight, bounty hunters shooting from helicopters opined that they were far more difficult to hunt while flying than golden eagles as they would turn, double back or dive as soon as approached. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast. It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, {{making it impossible to}} obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer. The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of thermals, updrafts, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00a.m. and 6:00p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{intensity}} falls exponentially with depth y, heat absorption is concentrated {{at the top}} layers. Typically in the tropics, surface temperature values are in excess of , while at , the temperature is about [...] The warmer (and hence lighter) waters at the surface means there are no <b>thermal</b> <b>convection</b> currents. Due to the small temperature gradients, heat transfer by conduction is too low to equalize the temperatures. The ocean is thus both a practically infinite heat source and a practically infinite heat sink.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{oxidizer}} is oxygen {{from the}} surrounding air, {{the presence of a}} force of gravity, or of some similar force caused by acceleration, is necessary to produce convection, which removes combustion products and brings a supply of oxygen to the fire. Without gravity, a fire rapidly surrounds itself with its own combustion products and non-oxidizing gases from the air, which exclude oxygen and [...] the fire. Because of this, the risk of fire in a spacecraft is small when it is coasting in inertial flight. Of course, this does not apply if oxygen is supplied to the fire by some process other than <b>thermal</b> <b>convection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vertical {{furnaces}} also eliminate {{an issue}} that plagued horizontal furnaces: non-uniformity of grown oxide across the wafer. Horizontal furnaces typically have convection currents inside the tube which causes {{the bottom of the}} tube to be slightly colder than the top of the tube. As the wafers lie vertically in the tube the convection and the temperature gradient with it causes the top of the wafer to have a thicker oxide than the bottom of the wafer. Vertical furnaces solve this problem by having wafer sitting horizontally, and then having the gas flow in the furnace flowing from top to bottom, significantly damping any <b>thermal</b> <b>convections.</b>|$|R
