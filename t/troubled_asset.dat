During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund.
