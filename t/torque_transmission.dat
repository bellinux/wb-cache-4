5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, road surface temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high <b>torque</b> <b>transmission</b> systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E

50|$|For light loads (such as {{encountered}} by a lathe tailstock or a drill press), tools with self-holding tapers are simply slipped onto {{or into the}} spindle; {{the pressure of the}} spindle against the workpiece drives the tapered shank tightly into the tapered hole. The friction across the entire surface area of the interface provides a large amount of <b>torque</b> <b>transmission,</b> so that splines or keys are not required.|$|E

50|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, a key is {{a machine}} element used to connect a rotating machine element to a shaft.

The whole system is called a keyed joint. A keyed joint may allow relative axial movement between the parts.|$|E
