40|$|Summary Objective: To {{characterize}} the motor performance of newborns in a neonatal unit of tertiary level {{and compare the}} results to the values recommended by the Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP). Method: Newborns between 34 and 416 / 7 weeks of corrected gestational age, breathing spontaneously and presenting state of consciousness 4 or 5, according to Brazelton, were included. TIMP {{was used to evaluate}} the motor performance. Results: <b>The</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> 34 - 35 and 36 - 37 weeks showed on average TIMP scores similar to the reference values (p> 0. 05), while in <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> 38 - 39 weeks and 40 - 41 weeks TIMP scores were statistically lower than the reference values (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 018, respectively).

Conclusion: The newborns showed average scores compared to the TIMP reference values; however, there were two groups whose performances were within the low average. There {{was no significant difference in}} motor performance <b>of</b> newborns in <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> 38 - 39 and 40 - 41 weeks.
