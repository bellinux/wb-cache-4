25|$|In every control dialect, some syllables with {{different}} spellings will be pronounced the same. However, which these are differs from dialect to dialect. There are some irregular correlations: Often a particular variety {{will have a}} pronunciation for a syllable <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> one would expect from other syllables with similar spellings, due to irregular developments in that variety. This is especially true with the voicing of Japanese consonants, which has evolved idiosyncratically in different compound words. However, except for Japanese voicing, the system is phonetic about 90% of the time.|$|E

And {{even if it}} were a rendition, we understand as a government what our obligations are with respect to anyone who is rendered by this government to another country, and that is that we seek to satisfy ourselves {{that they will not be}} tortured. And we do that in every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, we would have sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|E
25|$|Note that v {{does not}} {{represent}} the velocity that magnetic fields lines travel through the conductor. The magnetic field pattern observed depends on the frame of reference. They have no velocity on their own. To illustrate, imagine that one were to take a magnet and flip it 180 degrees. The result of assuming that these field lines actually have velocity of their own would be that magnetic field lines far away would swing to the other side, potentially faster {{than the speed of}} light, however, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> happens.|$|E

25|$|It is Tobias’s friend Harry (and his wife, Edna) {{who bring}} the play to its conclusion, forcing Tobias {{to define what}} {{friendship}} is all about. In the end, Tobias proclaims that friendship is not about wants but rather about rights. Tobias’s friend Harry {{has the right to}} move into Tobias’s house even if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> Tobias, or the rest of his family, wants. Contradicting this conclusion is the story concerning his cat that Tobias tells {{in the middle of the}} play. In this case, the cat wanted to be left alone. Tobias was uncomfortable with the cat’s noncompliance, and eventually he hits the cat and then has the cat euthanised. But disregarding the cat, Tobias seems true to his definition of friendship. He has, after all, allowed his sister-in-law to live off him. He allows his thirty-something daughter to continually move in and out of his house, and he tolerates his wife. He also tolerates his friend Harry’s moving into his house uninvited. At the end of the play, Tobias questions Harry’s efforts at friendship and honesty. Then he apologizes. Albee admits that the character of Tobias is based on his adopted father.|$|E
500|$|Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, {{disagreed}} with these interpretations of koi {{and the notion}} that the story was a [...] "bittersweet romance" [...] or [...] "another love story", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations—in their [...] "garden of words"—they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, [...] "romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> the story is about". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship [...] "without needing to cling to each other". However, neither could [...] "learn to walk again" [...] if they continued to isolate themselves {{from the rest of the}} world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.|$|E

[...] However, the DOJ Inspector General's report {{concluded}} that there was nothing false or intentionally misleading in Gonzales' account.|$|E

2500|$|The Runs {{producer}} Alex Grimbley {{confirmed that}} The Run would not feature {{any form of}} vehicle customization, stating: [...] "We decided against customization because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> The Run is about. It is an understandable stance given that {{is a whole new}} direction for the franchise. We want to focus on the story and the race itself." [...] However, this statement was retracted after some trailers and screenshots of the game featured visually modified vehicles. A GameSpot trailer released on November 2, 2011 officially confirmed that body kits and selectable body paints can be placed on vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{has also}} been a regular {{contributor}} to discussions about issues of race and religion, among other topics, in national magazines and on television. He has written a regular column for Time, for example, and he appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday, January 25, 2015, to talk about a recent column, which pointed out that Islam should not be blamed for the actions of violent extremists, just as Christianity has not been blamed for the actions of violent extremists who profess Christianity. [...] When asked about being Muslim, he said: [...] "I don't have any misgiving about my faith. I'm very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> Islam is about, and that should not be what people think of when they think about Muslims. But it's up to all of us to do something about all of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{detailed}} review of four sittings done by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all the statements on the TV show Hollywood Medium. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter {{felt that the}} reading was very successful. In after interviews with each sitter all four claimed that Henry had made specific statements, but after reviewing the show it showed that he had not. Each sitter misremembered the statement. One of many examples of this was when Henry during a session with celebrity Ross Matthews stated [...] "Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi"? Matthews stated that his father who was a hunter would not shoot deer because of the movie Bambi. In the post interview, Matthews stated that [...] "it was weird that Henry knew that my father would not shoot deer because of Bambi", when <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> was said, Matthews had misremembered what Henry had said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 Vollenhoven {{founded the}} “Association for Calvinistic Philosophy,” with Philosophia Reformata as its {{academic}} journal, Mededelingen to report its internal affairs, and Correspondentiebladen for exploratory discussions. Vollenhoven, {{who was the}} chairperson, opened the first meeting with the words: “ brings us together here is something glorious. It is not philosophy, for <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> comes first in our lives. Rather it is the bond to God’s Word, for by grace we have learned to desire to live solely through Christ, [...] religion, as concern of the heart, has become {{the center of our}} whole existence.” Of philosophy, as then current, Vollenhoven said: “ knows nothing of a God as understood in the Scriptures; nothing of a heart that can only find rest in Him; nothing of world history, which lies anchored in the first and second Adam; also very little of the difference between life terrains, the distinction of which appears so necessary in daily life.” ...|$|E
