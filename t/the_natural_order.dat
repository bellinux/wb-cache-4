5|$|In 1799, the Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described Protea acufera, later {{identified as}} a synonym by Salisbury and Robert Brown. I.anethifolius gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill-leaved isopogon (Isopogon anethifolius) by English plantsman Joseph Knight in his controversial work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of Proteeae. Robert Brown had written of the genus Isopogon but Knight had hurried out his work before Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper On <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of plants called Proteaceae in the Transactions of the Linnean Society in 1810.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E

5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} in New South Wales, the wallum banksia had gone by the {{scientific}} name of Banksia serratifolia. Richard Anthony Salisbury had published this binomial name in 1796, which was followed by Otto Kuntze, and then Karel Domin in 1921. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George conclusively established aemula as the correct name {{to be used in}} his 1981 revision of the genus. He pointed out that Salisbury's original described the leaves only, was insufficient to diagnose the species and is hence a nomen dubium—the description could have fit juvenile leaves of B.paludosa as well. In fact, Brown himself had been unsure whether serratifolia applied to what he called Banksia aemula. Salisbury's taxon appeared as Banksia serraefolia in Knight's 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of Proteeae, but that entry might also refer to serrata. Where Salisbury got his material is unclear, but John White had sent material to James Edward Smith now held in the Linnean Society marked as B.serratifolia Salisb. as well as B.aemula R.Br.|$|E

5|$|The early Western Han court {{simultaneously}} {{accepted the}} philosophical teachings of Legalism, Huang-Lao Daoism, and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy. However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (bóshì 博士) {{not dealing with}} the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551–479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign {{was the creation of}} Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BC). Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual, filial piety, and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies. Much to the interest of the ruler, Dong's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of the universe. The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century AD. A Confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns, where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} people have lived {{on or near the}} St. Johns, {{including}} Paleo-indians, Archaic people, Timucua, Mocama, French and Spanish settlers, Seminoles, slaves and freemen, Florida crackers, land developers, tourists and retirees. It {{has been the subject of}} William Bartram's journals, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' books, and Harriet Beecher Stowe's letters home. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, it was the last U.S. territory on the east coast to be developed; it remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. When attention was turned to the state, however, much of the land was rapidly overdeveloped in a national zeal for progress. The St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers. It suffered severe pollution and human interference that has diminished <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> of life in and around the river. In all, 3.5 million people live within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River. The St. Johns, named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008. Restoration efforts are under way for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida continues to deal with population increases in the river's vicinity.|$|E

25|$|One problem {{posed by}} the {{question}} of the existence of God is that traditional beliefs usually ascribe to God various supernatural powers. Supernatural beings may be able to conceal and reveal themselves for their own purposes, as for example in the tale of Baucis and Philemon. In addition, according to concepts of God, God is not part of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order,</b> but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus in Aristotelian philosophy, God is viewed as part of the explanatory structure needed to support scientific conclusions and any powers God possesses are—strictly speaking—of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>order</b> that is derived from God's place as originator of nature (see also Monadology).|$|E

40|$|Introduction It is {{well-known}} (see, e. g. [2] and [4]) {{that the use}} of red/black or multicolor orderings to parallelize SSOR or ILU preconditioning may seriously degrade the rate of convergence of the conjugate gradient method, as compared with <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>ordering.</b> <b>The</b> SOR iteration itself, however, does not suffer this degradation. Indeed, if the coefficient matrix is consistently ordered with property A, the asymptotic rates of convergence of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> and red/black orderings are identical (Young[9]); moreover, in practice one quite often sees faster convergence in the red/black <b>ordering</b> than in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>ordering.</b> This suggests <b>the</b> possible use of SOR as a parallel preconditioner. It cannot be a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method on symmetric positive definite systems since the corresponding preconditioned matrix is not symmetric. But this restriction does not apply to nonsymmetric systems and conjugate-gradient type methods such as GMRE...|$|R
