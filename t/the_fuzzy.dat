It is {{pointed out that}} <b>the</b> n-dimensional <b>fuzzy</b> set is a generalization of <b>the</b> Zadeh <b>fuzzy</b> set, <b>the</b> interval-valued <b>fuzzy</b> set, <b>the</b> intuitionistic <b>fuzzy</b> set, <b>the</b> interval-valued intuitionistic <b>fuzzy</b> set and <b>the</b> three dimensional <b>fuzzy</b> set.

The cut set of <b>the</b> n-dimensional <b>fuzzy</b> set and n-dimensional vector level set of <b>the</b> Zadeh <b>fuzzy</b> set are both defined as n+ 1 -valued fuzzy sets. It is shown that a cut set defined in this way has the same properties as a normal cut set of <b>the</b> Zadeh <b>fuzzy</b> set.

50|$|<b>The</b> second book, <b>Fuzzy</b> Sapiens, {{deals with}} the newly 'Charterless Zarathustra Company' and its gradual {{cooperation}} with the planet's new governor to ensure chaos does not take over the planet, while <b>the</b> <b>Fuzzies</b> attach themselves to individual human guardians including members of the Company staff. Victor Grego, one of the villains of the first book and {{the manager of the}} CZC, finds a Fuzzy in his private apartment in the Company tower, adopts him, names him Diamond, and become a firm supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Fuzzies.</b> This enables <b>the</b> Company to cooperate with the new planetary government headed up by naturalist Ben Rainsford and work with the Native Affairs Commission headed up by Jack Holloway. It becomes clear that criminals are using the irregular status of the government and of the Company to attack it and steal sunstones. With the help of <b>the</b> <b>Fuzzies,</b> <b>the</b> thieves are thwarted. There is also further exploration into the biology of <b>the</b> <b>Fuzzies,</b> and it is established that <b>the</b> <b>Fuzzies</b> may be in a biological dead end, doomed to extinction without aid from the humans.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fuzzy</b> logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how {{likely it is that}} a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of <b>the</b> <b>fuzzy</b> logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E

25|$|Kiwi berries are edible berry- or grape-sized fruits {{similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>fuzzy</b> kiwifruit in taste and appearance, but with thin, smooth green skin. They are {{primarily}} produced by three species of kiwifruit; hardy kiwi (Actinidia arguta), Arctic beauty (A. kolomikta), and silver vine (A. polygama).

25|$|The golden kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) has a smooth, bronze skin, with a beak shape at {{the stem}} attachment. Flesh color varies from bright green to a clear, intense yellow.

One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around {{the center of the}} fruit and yellow flesh outside.

25|$|Canon {{developed}} an autofocusing camera {{that uses a}} charge-coupled device (CCD) to measure {{the clarity of the}} image in six regions of its field of view and use the information provided to determine if the image is in focus. It also tracks the rate of change of lens movement during focusing, and controls its speed to prevent overshoot. The camera's fuzzy control system uses 12 inputs: 6 to obtain the current clarity data provided by the CCD and 6 to measure the rate of change of lens movement. The output is the position of the lens. <b>The</b> <b>fuzzy</b> control system uses 13 rules and requires 1.1 kilobytes of memory.|$|E

Fuzzy clustering has shown advantages over crisp and probabilistic clustering, especially when there are signicant overlaps between clusters.
