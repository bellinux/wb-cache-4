His grandmother persuaded him to adopt his cousin Alexander, a youth of much more promise, who took the name of Severus. The soldiers were charmed with him; Elagabalus became jealous, {{and was going to}} strip him of his honors; but this angered the Prætorians, so that they put the elder Emperor to death in 222.|$|E

5000|$|C++ and C99, but not its {{predecessors}} K&R C and C89, have support for [...] functions, though with different semantics. In both cases, [...] does not force inlining; the compiler is free <b>to</b> <b>chose</b> not to inline the function at all, or only in some cases.

Mainstream C++ compilers like Microsoft Visual C++ and GCC support {{an option that}} lets the compilers automatically inline any suitable function, even those not marked as [...] functions. However, simply omitting the [...] keyword to let the compiler make all inlining decisions is not possible, since the linker will then complain about duplicate definitions in different translation units.
