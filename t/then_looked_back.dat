2500|$|The lordship {{attributes}} {{associated with}} the Kyrios image of Jesus also implied his power over all creation. Paul <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> and reasoned that the final lordship of Jesus was prepared from the very beginning, starting with pre-existence and the Nativity, based on his obedience as the image of God. Over time, based {{on the influence of}} Anselm of Canterbury, Bernard of Clairvaux and others, the Kyrios image of Jesus began to be supplemented with a more [...] "tender image of Jesus", and the Franciscan approach to popular piety was instrumental in establishing this image.|$|E
60|$|Vane {{liked the}} man's face and manner. He {{shook hands with}} him, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at Kitty.|$|E
60|$|The gaunt Ladd {{rose from}} his shaded seat, and removed his pipe from smiling lips, and turned to nod at Jim, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And ugly. Don't forget that--and ugly. Look {{where you}} like. Look near you, here abroad where you are, and <b>then</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at home, whence you came." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked away}} at Giovanelli, who was decorating {{himself with his}} almond blossom. <b>Then</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> at Winterbourne, [...] "I shouldn't think you would let people be so unkind!" [...] she said.|$|R
50|$|Even though The Buddha {{is set in}} the 1970s {{and ends}} just before the Thatcher era begins, Kureishi was writing it under the direct {{influence}} of the outcome of Thatcherism. It is not surprising <b>then,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> that he can see the roots of conservatism already in the '70s.|$|R
60|$|Addressed thus directly, {{the manager}} allowed {{his gaze to}} wander from the ceiling. He eyed Psmith for a moment like an elderly basilisk, <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at the ceiling again.|$|E
60|$|And at a {{touch the}} {{impatient}} King was off. From far {{up the slope}} near a monument Lucy looked back. Slone was watching her. She waved a gauntleted hand--and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> no more.|$|E
60|$|Arthur Inglewood glanced curiously for {{an instant}} at the huge {{creature}} {{at the foot of}} the table, who was fitting a paper figure with a cocked hat, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at Dr. Pym, who was concluding in a quieter tone.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> and saw Mr. Sumner at his desk, and his astonishment increased.|$|R
60|$|About half-way up the defile, {{when they}} had traversed it for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, Sheikh Hassan {{suddenly}} galloped forward and hurled his spear with great force at an isolated crag, the base of which was covered with oleanders, and <b>then</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> he shouted to his companions. Tancred and the foremost hurried up to him.|$|R
60|$|We {{thought him}} very wicked <b>then,</b> but, <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> I {{am not sure}} that we were not very wicked ourselves.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood at}} the window {{watching}} Ferrand start into the world again; <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at his own comfortable room, {{with the number of}} things that had accumulated somehow--the photographs of countless friends, the old arm-chairs, the stock of coloured pipes. Into him restlessness had passed with the farewell clasp of the foreigner's damp hand. To wait about in London was unbearable.|$|E
60|$|A {{week later}} Frank and Harry and Jake sailed {{out in the}} sloop to {{intercept}} the south-bound steamer. She came up, with side-wheels churning a broad track of foam and her smoke trail streaming astern. When her engines stopped, Frank and Harry dropped into the canoe {{and in a few}} minutes they were alongside. Frank swung himself up on board and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at the canoe.|$|E
60|$|He took a reef in the counterpane {{and with}} {{a fair amount of}} dignity, {{considering}} his appearance, stalked upstairs again and stood gloomily considering affairs in his bedroom. Ever since Gladys and Dorothy had been big enough to be objects of interest to the young men of the neighbourhood the clothes nuisance had been rampant. He peeped through the window-blind at the bright sunshine outside, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at the tumbled bed. A murmur of voices downstairs apprised him that the conspirators were awaiting the result.|$|E
60|$|The wedding-journeyers hung, {{they knew}} not how long, in rapture on the sight; and <b>then,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> {{from the shore}} {{to the spot where}} they had stood, they felt {{relieved}} that unreality should possess itself of all, and that the bridge should swing there in mid-air like a filmy web, scarce more passable than the rainbow that flings its arch above the mists.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, never mind,' she said, with indifference; 'I'll ask {{him about}} it, and he will tell me.' Down she came and turned away. <b>Then</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> again {{she thought it was}} absurd such a trifle should puzzle her. She retraced her steps, and opened a drawer beneath the ledge of the cabinet, pushing in her hand and feeling about on the {{underside}} of the board.|$|R
60|$|But White Fang {{could not}} believe. He {{looked at the}} master, {{and he looked at}} the dogs. <b>Then</b> he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> eagerly and questioningly at the master.|$|R
60|$|She {{was allowed}} to go to her brother for a little while that evening, with some hope that she might prevail with him. She found him leaning against the window in the failing light, listlessly {{watching}} the horses and grooms in the mews, which his high window overlooked. He turned his head as she came in, but without speaking, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at the window, till she came up to him, put her arm round his neck and turned his face towards her. It was a sullen, dogged countenance, such as she had seldom or never seen him wear before.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the little group of daintily attired, soft-handed {{men and women on}} board the launch, to whom the stress of {{physical}} labor was an unknown thing, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> towards the coal-grimed toilers on the lighter. As yet they worked on stubbornly, with tense furrowed faces, under a scorching sun, taxing to the uttermost every muscle in their bodies, but {{it seemed to him that}} the lighter was no further from the reef. He flung an arm up, and hailed them, for he had acquired a working acquaintance with several Latin languages on the fever coast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{acknowledged}} to you, Mr. Sherwin, that I have found means {{to speak to}} your daughter--to speak to her twice. I made my advances honourably. She received them with a modesty and a reluctance worthy of herself, worthy of any lady, the highest lady in the land." [...] (Mr. Sherwin looked round reverentially to his print of the Queen; <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at me, and bowed solemnly.) [...] "Now, although {{in so many words}} she directly discouraged me--it is her due that I should say this--still, I think I may without vanity venture to hope that she did so as a matter of duty, more than as a matter of inclination." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{along his}} path. [...] And heard {{the clash of}} steel on steel, Where man faced man, in deadly wrath, [...] While clanged the tocsin's hurrying peal.|$|R
60|$|He skated on, {{allowing}} {{the girl to}} rest on his arm as he did so. Soon {{they seemed to be}} out of the danger zone, and <b>then</b> he <b>looked</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{along his}} path, [...] And heard {{the clash of}} steel on steel, [...] Where man faced man, in deadly wrath, [...] While clanged the tocsin's hurrying peal.|$|R
60|$|He cast anxious {{glances at}} his mate, but she showed {{no desire to}} get up. He looked outside, {{and half a dozen}} snow-birds fluttered across his field of vision. He started to get up, <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> to his mate again, and settled down and dozed. A shrill and minute singing stole upon his heating. Once, and twice, he sleepily brushed his nose with his paw. Then he woke up. There, buzzing in the air at the tip of his nose, was a lone mosquito. It was a full-grown mosquito, one that had lain frozen in a dry log all winter and that had now been thawed out by the sun. He could resist the call of the world no longer. Besides, he was hungry.|$|E
6000|$|But Lady Desmond {{could not}} be cordial with her daughter. She made more than one {{struggle}} to do so, but always failed. She could,--she thought that she could, have watched her child's happiness with contentment had Clara married Owen Fitzgerald--Sir Owen, as he would then have been. But now she could only remember that Owen was lost to them both, lost through her child's fault. She did not hate Clara: nay, she would have made any sacrifice for her daughter's welfare; {{but she could not}} take her lovingly to her bosom. So she shut herself up alone, in her prison as she called it, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> upon the errors of her life. It was as well for her to look back as to look forward, for what joy was there for which she could dare to hope? ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{little time}} before the date of this service in the cathedral the pretty, liquid-eyed, light-footed young woman Sue Bridehead had an afternoon's holiday, and leaving the ecclesiastical {{establishment}} in which she not only assisted but lodged, took a walk into {{the country with a}} book in her hand. It was one of those cloudless days which sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet, as if intercalated by caprice of the weather-god. She went along for a mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city she had left behind her. The road passed between green fields, and coming to a stile Sue paused there, to finish the page she was reading, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old.|$|E
60|$|They walked {{very quickly}} for a while. Now and <b>then</b> Arthur <b>looked</b> <b>back.</b> The night was still quite dark, {{and the stars}} shone out in their myriads. At last he slackened their pace.|$|R
60|$|Disco, {{speechless}} with amazement, rose up and {{sprang to}} the helm. Of course {{he could not}} use his bound hands, {{but one of his}} legs answered almost as well. He allowed the boat to come round until the sail filled on the other tack, and <b>then</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back,</b> saw the heads of the Arabs as they swam through the channel and made for the shore. In a few minutes they gained it, and, after uttering a shout of defiance, ran up into the bushes and disappeared.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned his}} eyes aside, {{and looked at}} her hands as she washed the forks. They trembled slightly. <b>Then</b> he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at her eyes again, that were {{watching}} him large and wistful and a little accusing.|$|R
60|$|Wallace <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> to Phonny's work. He {{saw that}} Phonny was {{guessing}} his way along. The holes were not equidistant from each other, {{and then they}} were not at the same distance {{from the edge of the}} board. As he had advanced along the line, he had drawn gradually nearer and nearer to the edge, and, what was a still greater difficulty, the holes in the lower board, which was to form the bottom of the cage, since their places too had been guessed at, did not correspond with those above, so that the wires, when they came to be put in, inclined some this way, and some that. In some places the wires came very near together, and in others the spaces between them were so wide, that Wallace thought that the squirrel, if by any chance he should ever get put into the cage, would be very likely to squeeze his way out.|$|E
6000|$|Cap now gave a {{tremendous}} hem, felt for his queue {{as if to}} ascertain its safety, and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{in order to examine}} the danger he had gone through. His safety is easily explained. Most of the river fell perpendicularly ten or twelve feet; but near its centre the force of the current had so far worn away the rock as to permit the water to shoot through a narrow passage, at an angle of about forty or forty five degrees. Down this ticklish descent the canoe had glanced, amid fragments of broken rock, whirlpools, foam, and furious tossings of the element, which an uninstructed eye would believe menaced inevitable destruction to an object so fragile. But the very lightness of the canoe had favored its descent; for, borne on the crest of the waves, and directed by a steady eye and an arm full of muscle, it had passed like a feather from one pile of foam to another, scarcely permitting its glossy side to be wetted. There were a few rocks to be avoided, the proper direction was to be rigidly observed, and the fierce current did the rest. (1) ...|$|E
60|$|And {{even while}} {{they seemed to}} hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them, they had to stand and stamp while the French Colonel talked to the French wood-cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of market-day. At {{the end of the}} four minutes, however, they saw that the Colonel was right, for the wood-cutter entered into their plans, not with the vague servility of a tout too-well paid, but with the {{seriousness}} of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee. He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy, where the innkeeper, an old soldier who had become devout in his latter years, would be certain to sympathise with them, and even to take risks in their support. The whole company, therefore, piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood, and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland. Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was driven quickly enough, and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those, whoever they were, who were hunting them. For, after all, the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved. One man's presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the Secretary. Syme every now and <b>then</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{over his shoulder at the}} army on their track.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, I {{just looked}} at him--coolly, you know, and <b>looked</b> at her. <b>Then</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at him again--taking my time, you know. 'I don't think that that's a fair {{question}} to put to me,' says I." ...|$|R
40|$|Computers and {{language}} are intimately connected in four ways: (1) {{the computer is}} a tool for representing knowledge through symbols, (2) it is a device for interpreting symbolic structures, (3) it is a communication device, and (4) it is a redefinable tool. This essay considers these four aspects of computers by taking an excursion into a classroom of the year 2010, and <b>then</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> to evidence of precursors in classrooms of the 1980 's.

6000|$|... "Just look at this, Mrs. Maze," [...] said Gaites {{when she}} drew {{near enough to}} read the address on the piano-case.
