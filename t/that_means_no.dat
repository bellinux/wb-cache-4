500|$|Before being {{approached}} by Benioff and Weiss, Martin had had other meetings with other scriptwriters, {{most of them}} wanting {{to turn it into}} a feature film. Martin however deemed it [...] "unfilmable" [...] and impossible to be done as a feature film, stating that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as three feature films. Similarly, Benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, [...] "a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>no</b> sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that." [...] Martin himself was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an HBO series, saying that he [...] "never imagined it anywhere else". [...] "I knew it couldn't be done as a network television series. It's too adult. The level of sex and violence would never have gone through." ...|$|E

2500|$|Romance novelist Jaid Black (pseudonym for Tina Engler) {{said that}} [...] "many of my female readers enjoy rape fantasies, key word being fantasies. They {{certainly}} wouldn't {{want it to}} happen in real life, but enjoy the escapism and total lack of control provided by 'forced seduction' scenes in erotic romance novels". According to one reader of romance, women readers are quite capable of separating fantasy from reality: [...] "In real life {{there is no such thing}} as forced seduction. When a woman says no in real life, <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>no,</b> because in real life, rape is about violence and power. Rape in real life involves no pleasure for the woman". Alison Kent, author of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Erotic Romance, says the theme is rare in modern romance novels; Linda Lee also cites scholarship to conclude that [...] "by the mid-1980s, the rape fantasy was rejected". However, forced seduction has been used as a plot point in post-1980s romance novels.|$|E

How upon earth he contrived, on some occasions, to settle his latitude, is more than I can tell. The longitude he must either have obtained by the Rule of Three, or else by special revelation.

She would not really conciliate you by marrying, for you wouldnt associate with her a bit the more because of her marriage certificate. Of course I am putting her self-respect out of the question, that being a matter between herself and her conscience, with which we have no concern. Believe me, neither actresses nor any other class will trouble themselves about the opinion of a society in which they are allowed to have neither part nor lot. Perhaps I am wrong to talk about such matters to you; but you are trained to feel all the worst that can be felt for my sister; and I feel bound {{to let you know that}} there is something to be said in her defence. I have no right to blame her, as she has done me no harm. The only way in which her conduct can influence my prospects will be through her being an undesirable sister-in-law in case I should want to marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, firstly, {{with regard}} to all that the {{schoolmaster}} and schoolmistress means by the [...] "formation of character." [...] A {{large proportion of the}} scholastic profession will profess, and a still larger proportion of the public believes, that it is possible by talk and specially designed instruction, to give a boy or girl a definite bias towards [...] "truth," [...] towards acts called [...] "healthy" [...] (a word it would puzzle the ordinary schoolmaster or schoolmistress extremely to define, glib as they are with it), towards honour, towards generosity, enterprise, self-reliance, and the like. The masters in our public schools are far from blameless in this respect, and you may gauge the quality of many of these gentlemen pretty precisely by their disposition towards the [...] "school pulpit" [...] line of business. Half an hour's [...] "straight talk to the boys," [...] impromptu vague sentimentality about Earnestness, Thoroughness, True Patriotism, and so forth, seems to assuage the conscience as nothing else could do, for weeks of ill- prepared, ill-planned teaching, and years of preoccupation with rowing- boats and cricket. The more extreme examples of this type will say in a tone of manly apology, [...] "It does the boys good to tell them plainly what I think about serious things"--when the simple fact of the case is too often that he does all he can not to think about any things of any sort whatever, except cricket and promotion. Schoolmistresses, again, will sometimes come near boasting to the inquiring parent of our [...] "ethical hour," [...] and if you probe the facts you will find <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>no</b> more and no less than an hour of floundering egotism, in which a poor illogical soul, with a sort of naive indecency, talks nonsense about [...] "Ideals," [...] about the Higher and the Better, about Purity, and about many secret and sacred things, things upon which wise men are often profoundly uncertain, to incredulous or imitative children. All that is needed to do this sort of thing abundantly and freely is a certain degree of aggressive egotism, a certain gift of stupidity, good intentions, and a defective sense of educational possibilities and limitations.|$|E
