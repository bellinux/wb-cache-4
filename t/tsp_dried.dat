40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{quality of}} air and noise levels around Okirika {{communities}} in River State were determined using portable hand held air monitors for air pollutants and anemometer for meteorological parameters. The parameters measured were suspended particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, methane and volatile organic carbon, temperature, wind speed, wind direction and relative humidity. The results showed the highest concentrations of 0. 007 mg/m 3 (PM 1, dry), 0. 036 mg/m 3 (PM 2. 5, dry), 0. 286 mg/m 3 (PM 7, dry), 0. 378 mg/m 3 (PM 10, dry), 0. 503 mg/m 3 (<b>TSP,</b> <b>dry),</b> 1. 7 ppm (NO 2, dry), 3. 0 ppm (CH 4, dry), 0. 2 ppm (H 2 S, dry), 12. 7 ppm (CO, dry), 2. 7 ppm (NH 3, dry), and 7. 0 ppm (VOC, rainy). The dry season concentrations of air pollutants were higher than the rainy season concentrations. The observed differences in mean concentrations of the air pollutants between the two seasons were not significant in case of TSP (P< 0. 05) but were significant (P< 0. 05) in other pollutants. The highest mean concentrations of the gaseous pollutants exceeded permissible limits and therefore pose environmental and health concern for {{the inhabitants of the}} area. The quality of air in the area is poor and need to be regularly monitored...|$|R
40|$|An on-farm {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} possibility of Artemia culture with salt in the traditional solar salt beds of Bangladesh {{and to find out}} the impact of various fertilization treatments on the production performance of Artemia (cysts and biomass) and salt through integrated approach. Four treatments in two consecutive years of experiment like, T 1 and T 2 (in the first year), T 3 and T 4 (in the second year) was applied for this integrated culture system. Treatments were comprised of application of urea and triple super phosphate (<b>TSP)</b> and <b>dried</b> and powdered chicken manure at different doses. Study reveals that modified solar salt beds of Bangladesh having suitable water quality can be successfully utilized for salt Artemia production in the winter months. A significant higher production of Artemia cysts (P= 0. 0015) and biomass (P= 0. 0136) was found for treatments T 3 (15. 23 kg/ha DW) and T 3 (196. 10 kg/ha WW) respectively.

40|$|Tamarind seed {{polysaccharide}} (TSP), {{a natural}} polysaccharide extracted from tamarind seeds {{is used in}} the pharmaceutical, textile and food industries as a mucoadhesive polymer. This work aimed to extract TSP from tamarind seeds from three sources with two methods and characterized its physical and chemical properties. Kernel powder of tamarind seeds was slurried into a clear solution, set aside overnight and then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min to separate all foreign matter. The supernatant was separated and poured into excess 95 % ethanol with continuous stirring. The precipitate obtained was collected and dried in the oven and then the <b>dried</b> <b>TSP</b> polymer was stored in a desiccator. The <b>dried</b> <b>TSP</b> was analyzed by 1 H-NMR, FT-IR and XRD. The results showed TSP from tamarind seeds taken from paddy farmland (A), a waste from the export tamarind juice industry (B) and the export tamarind powder industry(C) gave yields of 31. 55 %, 26. 95 % and 17. 30 %, respectively, using method 1 and 11. 15 %, 53. 65 % and 54. 65 %, with method 2, respectively, but method 2 gave purer TSP than method 1. The FT-IR spectra displayed peaks at 3351. 95 cm− 1, 2920. 76 cm− 1, 1018. 85 cm− 1 and 555. 16 cm− 1.

40|$|Background: Phosphorus {{recycling}} from {{waste and}} localised placement of fertilisers can be means to improve sustainable P management in agriculture. However, knowledge about root and plant P uptake responses to placement of complex waste- derived fertilisers is lacking. Methods: Sewage sludge (SS) and sewage sludge ash (ASH) were tested against triple superphosphate (TSP) in a rhizobox setup where shoot and root growth of maize was followed for 30 days. The three P sources were either mixed homogenously {{into the soil}} (labelled with 33 P) or localised in a patch close to the seed. Results: While localised TSP and SS both increased root length density around the fertiliser patch, {{it was at the}} expense of the remaining root system and soil P uptake for SS. Hence, total P uptake was slightly lower and dry matter yields similar to mixed SS. Thus, only <b>TSP</b> enhanced <b>dry</b> matter yield and fertiliser P uptake compared to the mixed source. No root response was found for localised ASH, and mixed ASH more than doubled dry matter yield and P uptake in comparison. Conclusions: Localised placement of fertilisers can be expected to be beneficial for young maize plants only for fertiliser types that can supply sufficient amounts of readily available P...|$|R

40|$|The {{ambient air}} {{concentrations}} and fluxes of various anionic species were sampled by MOUDI, <b>TSP</b> and <b>dry</b> deposition plates at a traffic sampling site in Taichung, central Taiwan. In the sampling period, from September to December 2000, the ambient air particle concentrations (PM 1, PM 2. 5, PM 10 and TSP) were {{lower in the}} September than in the other three months (October to December). The {{reason is that the}} northwest wind brought more particles (diameter less than 10 mum) and the higher wind speed caused higher dry deposition fluxes and TSP concentrations in the last three months. The anion species percentages of TSP were 0. 24 %, 13. 7 %, 0. 52 %, 12. 0 %, 18. 9 % and 54. 6 % for F-, Cl- 1 Br- 1 NO 2 - 1 NO 3 and SO 42 -, respectively. The results revealed that SO 42 -, NO 3, Cl- and NO 2 - were the dominant species at the traffic sampling site. The ion-size distributions of Cl-, NO 2 - and NO 3 were unimodal, the main peak being between 3. 2 and 5. 6 mum. In contrast, the size distribution Of SO 42 - was bimodal, with the main peaks in the particle size ranges 0. 32 - 0. 56 mum and 3. 2 - 5. 6 mum.

The P- 32 -P- 33 double isotope labeling technique was used to determine {{the relative}} contribution of green manures (GMs) and P fertilizers to P uptake by Setaria grass (Setaria sphacelata) grown in an amended tropical acid soil (Bungor series) in a glasshouse study. The amendments were factorial combinations of GMs (Calopogonium caeruleum, Gliricidia sepium and Imperata cylindrica) and P fertilizers [phosphate rocks (PRs) from North Carolina (NCPR), China (CPR) and Algeria (APR), and triple superphosphate (<b>TSP)</b> ]. <b>Dry</b> matter yield, P uptake, and P utilization from the amendments were monitored at 4, 8, and 15 weeks after establishment (WAE). The GMs alone or in combination with P fertilizers contributed less than 5 % to total P uptake in this soil, but total P uptake into Setaria plants in the GM treatments was three to four times that of the P fertilizers because the GMs mobilized more soil P. Also, the GMs markedly increased fertilizer P utilization in the combined treatments, from 3 % to 39 % with CPR, from 6 - 9 % to 19 - 48 % with reactive PRs, and from 6 % to 37 % with TSP in this soil. Both P GM and the other decomposition products were probably involved in reducing soil P-retention capacity. Mobilization of soil P was most likely the result of the action of the other decomposition products. These results demonstrate the high potential of integrating GMs and PRs for managing P in tropical soils and the importance of the soil P mobilization capacity of the organic components. Even the low-quality Imperata GM enhanced the effectiveness of the reactive APR more than fourfold...|$|R

The results obtained in this study indicated that the ambient air particulate mass concentrations in the daytime period (averaged 975. 4 mg/m 3) were higher than the night-time period (averaged 542. 1 mg/m 3). And the downward dry deposition fluxes (averaged 58. 12 mg/m 2 -sec) were about 2. 2 times that of upward dry deposition fluxes (averaged 26. 37 mg/m 2 -sec) in the daytime period. Furthermore, the average downward dry deposition fluxes (averaged 26. 54 mg/m 2 -sec) were also about 2. 3 times that of upward dry deposition fluxes (averaged 11. 52 mg/m 2 -sec) in the night-time period. Moreover, the average downward dry deposition fluxes are greater than the upward dry deposition fluxes for all the heavy metals in either daytime or night-time period. In addition, the deposition velocity for mass, metallic elements (Fe, Pb, Zn, Cu, Mg and Mn) during daytime and night-time period were also calculated.

Recently it is said that simplicia of medicinal crops originated from Asia is contaminated with heavy metals. That contamination mainly derives from Ihe environmental growth. Theefore, the research on the status of Cd in rhizomes Curcuma aeruginosa Roxb. due phosphate fertilizer is essential to be conducted. The experiment was conducted in the experimental garden of Research Institute for Spice and Medicinal Crops from August 1997 - June 1998. The experiment used polybags which were illed with 25 kg Bogor dry latosol soil mixed with I kg of rice husk and 2 kg cattle manue It used randomized block design (RBD) with four replications and ive samples each treatment. The treatments were (I) no NPK; and 8 dosages of TSP, (2) 0; (3) 2. 5; (4) 5; (5) 7. 5; (6) 10. 0; (7) 12. 5; (8) 15. 0; and (9) 20. 0 g/ polybag respectively.

40|$|Bioaerosols pose {{risks to}} human health and {{agriculture}} and may influence the evolution of mixed-phase clouds and the hydrological cycle on local and regional scales. The availability and reliability of methods and data on the abundance and properties of atmospheric bioaerosols, however, are rather limited. Here we analyze and compare data from different real-time ultraviolet laser/light-induced fluorescence (UV-LIF) instruments with results from a culture-based spore sampler and offline molecular tracers for airborne fungal spores in a semi-arid forest in the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Commercial UV-APS (ultraviolet aerodynamic particle sizer) and WIBS- 3 (wideband integrated bioaerosol sensor, version 3) instruments with different excitation and emission wavelengths were utilized to measure fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs) during both dry weather conditions and periods heavily influenced by rain. Seven molecular tracers of bioaerosols were quantified by analysis of total suspended particle (TSP) high-volume filter samples using a high-performance anion-exchange chromatography system with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). From the same measurement campaign, Huffman et al. (2013) previously reported dramatic increases in total and fluorescent particle concentrations during and immediately after rainfall and also showed a strong relationship between the concentrations of FAPs and ice nuclei (Huffman et al., 2013; Prenni et al., 2013). Here we investigate molecular tracers and show that during rainy periods the atmospheric concentrations of arabitol (35. 2 +/- 10. 5 ng m(- 3) /and mannitol (44. 9 +/- 13. 8 ng m(3) /were 3 - 4 times higher than during dry periods. During and after rain, the correlations between FAP and tracer mass concentrations were also significantly improved. Fungal spore number concentrations {{on the order of}} 10 (4) m(- 3), accounting for 2 - 5 % of <b>TSP</b> mass during <b>dry</b> periods and 17 - 23 % during rainy periods, were obtained from scaling the tracer measurements and from multiple analysis methods applied to the UV-LIF data. Endotoxin concentrations were also enhanced during rainy periods, but showed no correlation with FAP concentrations. Average mass concentrations of erythritol, levoglucosan, glucose, and (1 -> 3) -beta-D-glucan in TSP samples are reported separately for dry and rainy weather conditions. Overall, the results indicate that UV-LIF measurements can be used to infer fungal spore concentrations, but substantial development of instrumental and data analysis methods appears to be required for improved quantification...|$|R
