5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses <b>to</b> <b>neighbors</b> and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} if the 2 ̆ 2 Conservation <b>Neighbor</b> <b>to</b> <b>Neighbor</b> 2 ̆ 2 program was an effective method of delivery to inform farmers and ranchers about conservation practices in Nebraska. A survey instrument was developed with the help of a committee of experts. The instrument asked respondents to rate the degree of agreement, quality and interest in the Conservation <b>Neighbor</b> <b>to</b> <b>Neighbor</b> program and the effectiveness of the delivery method. The population for the study included all the program hosts and a random sampling of all farmers and ranchers in Nebraska. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: 1. Characteristics of hosts and general farmers and ranchers surveyed fit the Lionberger 2 ̆ 7 s (1968) and Roger 2 ̆ 7 s (1983) adoption diffusion theory descriptions of early and late adopters. 2. The general farmers and ranchers surveyed reported having less percentage of erodible acres then did the host. This supported a study done by (Hoover, Wiitala, 1980), in which farmers denied erosion problems existed on their land. 3. The primary sources from which the general farmers and ranchers surveyed had heard of the Conservation <b>Neighbor</b> <b>to</b> <b>Neighbor</b> program were farm magazines, newspapers, friends and neighbors. Field days and other farmers and ranchers were the top ranked delivery methods. This supported Lionsberger 2 ̆ 7 s (1968) and Roger 2 ̆ 7 s (1983) theory, that late adopters would receive information from local farmers, farm papers, and magazines. This also adds support <b>to</b> the conservation <b>Neighbor</b> <b>to</b> <b>Neighbor</b> program which used both field days and other farmers and ranchers to disseminate information. The Conservation <b>Neighbor</b> <b>to</b> <b>Neighbor</b> program was ranked 6 th by the host and 7 th by the general farmers and ranchers as a method of delivery. 5. Both groups (host and general farmers and ranchers) agreed with the benefits of the Conservation <b>Neighbor</b> <b>to</b> <b>Neighbor</b> program. Encourages farmers/ranchers to try a conservation practice. Is a good way for farmers/ranchers to share information. Is a good way to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of a conservation practice...|$|R
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, electrification was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of electrification and its lower priority meant electrification would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that electrification instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable <b>to</b> <b>neighbors,</b> citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for electrification of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The electrification of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a custom}} {{in the region}} of Banat that, after Christmas Eve dinner, groups of {{children}} go from house to house of their neighborhood and sing <b>to</b> <b>neighbors.</b> This custom is called korinđanje, and the children who participate in it are called korinđaši. They knock on a neighbor's door or ring the doorbell; when the neighbor comes out they greet him, and ask if they are allowed to sing. If the answer is affirmative, they sing a children's ditty or the Troparion of the Nativity. As a reward, the neighbor gives them candies or even money; more traditional gifts include walnuts, prunes, apples, and cakes. Not only can Serbian children be korinđaši, but also Romanian and Hungarian ones.|$|E

Gaia Trafikk, the city's bus company, set up a short makeshift bus route for the residents to help them get to work. The bus operated between Hamreveien, a minor road at the end of the trail, to the closest bus stop in Osvegen.

Occleshaw also noted that the patronymic on Larissa's gravestone was Feodorovna, which was also the patronymic adopted by Grand Duchess Tatiana's mother, Tsarina Alexandra, and that the surname Haouk bears close resemblance to the surname of Countess Julia von Hauke, an ancestress of the Mountbatten family and closely associated with Tatiana's Hessian relatives.|$|E
25|$|A Cayley graph is a graph defined {{from a pair}} (G,S) where G is a {{group and}} S {{is a set of}} {{generators}} for the group; it has a vertex for each group element, and an edge for each product of an element with a generator. In the case of a finite cyclic group, with its single generator, the Cayley graph is a cycle graph, and for an infinite cyclic group with its generator the Cayley graph is a doubly infinite path graph. However, Cayley graphs can be defined from other sets of generators as well. The Cayley graphs of cyclic groups with arbitrary generator sets are called circulant graphs. These graphs may be represented geometrically as a set of equally spaced points on a circle or on a line, with each point connected <b>to</b> <b>neighbors</b> with the same set of distances as each other point. They are exactly the vertex-transitive graphs whose symmetry group includes a transitive cyclic group.|$|E

Old Owl arrived with 40 warriors, and in a manner the Major called “most insolent,” demanded that the Tonkawa feed the war party and their horses, and provide for them entertainment. The Tonkawas, in fear of their lives, provided 40 women, food and shelter, and cared for the horses at once. Neighbors, who had just been appointed Indian Agent for all Texas Indians including the Comanche, took this opportunity to meet some of his new charges, and told them he was hopeful of civilizing them. Old Owl, introduced <b>to</b> <b>Neighbors,</b> complimented him on his fine blue coat. Neighbors, understanding the meaning of this compliment, presented the Chief with the coat immediately.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} that states respond asymmetrically to increases versus decreases in their neighboring states’ welfare benefit levels. We present a theoretical model suggesting that states respond more to decreases than to increases in their neighbors’ benefit levels. To test this proposition empirically, we use a panel of annual state-level data from 1983 to 1994 {{for each of the}} contiguous United States and the District of Columbia, and we observe changes in state demographic and economic characteristics as well as changes in state welfare benefits. We find substantial empirical evidence that uniformly supports our argument. State responses <b>to</b> <b>neighbor</b> benefit decreases tend to be at least twice as large as their responses <b>to</b> <b>neighbor</b> benefit increases. Our empirical results are robust <b>to</b> modeling <b>neighbor</b> benefits as endogenous. Our results, therefore, have substantial implications for public policy {{in the wake of the}} increased decentralization of welfare policy associated with the welfare reforms of 1996. ...|$|R
25|$|Again a {{human rights}} {{commission}} condemned the cramped conditions, so the government had the bars taken off the individual cells, and let the inmates move freely within each cell block. A prison riot in 1984 largely refigured the internal structure of the prison, and left the inmates with a greater measure of freedom to move around {{within the confines of}} the jail. The riot took place on the lower security lower floors; the maximum security cell blocks remained intact. The inmates ripped out the toilets in their cells to assure they would not be limited to individual cells again; they ripped out the glass in the visitors booths to assure direct contact with visitors. And they began knocking holes out of the outer walls to communicate between floors and gain access to sunlight. This also gave them a direct way of communicating with the outside world. According <b>to</b> <b>neighbors</b> who lived in apartments across the street from the prison during the 1980s and 1990s, girlfriends, mothers, brothers, friends, would fill the streets below the prison every day to chat with their loved ones living inside its walls.|$|E
