5|$|M-150 {{follows a}} single road, {{known locally as}} Rochester Road. The {{trunkline}} begins at an interchange where Rochester Road crosses the M-59 freeway at exit46 in Rochester Hills. From there it travels north past the Hampton Golf Club and the Winchester Mall between the intersections with Auburn and Hamlin roads. Past <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> development, the trunkline runs through residential subdivisions and near Rochester College. North of the Avon Road intersection, the highway enters Rochester and crosses the Clinton River. Rochester Road forms {{one of the main}} streets of the downtown area in Rochester as it passes through the city. North of Romeo Street, the road exits downtown and passes through another residential neighborhood. The highway crosses back into Rochester Hills before it terminates at the intersection with Tienken Road near another commercial development; Rochester Road continues northward as a locally maintained roadway.|$|E
5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{navigation}} {{was officially}} abandoned in 1888, but despite <b>this,</b> <b>commercial</b> {{use of the}} river continued until 1928. Following acquisition by the Great Ouse Catchment Board, locks at Barton Mills and Icklingham were rebuilt in the 1960s, but were isolated when the A11 road bridge was lowered soon afterwards. It now has one operational lock at Isleham, and can be navigated to Jude's Ferry.|$|E
25|$|The {{publicity}} {{gained by}} this achievement brought the company orders for {{large numbers of}} the Type XI, and several hundred were eventually made. <b>This</b> <b>commercial</b> success enabled the research {{side of the business}} to expand considerably, and in the years before the First World War a startlingly heterogeneous collection of aircraft were produced, although none came close to being as successful as the Type XI.|$|E
25|$|The main {{shopping}} precinct {{is located}} along Liverpool Road south of Ashfield railway station. Along this strip, {{there are a}} few medium-sized office blocks, many street-level shops and Ashfield Mall, a shopping centre containing supermarkets, a discount department store and specialty shops. <b>This</b> <b>commercial</b> area also extends into Charlotte Street and Elizabeth Street on the northern side of the station. A second commercial precinct is located along Parramatta Road consisting mostly of automotive-related retail and light industry.|$|E

25|$|O. vernalis is hunted {{by various}} predators, {{including}} the red-tailed hawk, great blue heron, rough-legged buzzard, bears, raccoons, foxes, {{and the common}} house cat. Humans also find these snakes in the wild and keep them for pets. They are subjected to commercial collection because of their nice skin coloration, passive nature, and small size. However, this snake is not known to survive well in captivity. Because their populations are usually isolated and small in size, <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> collection can greatly affect the overall population.|$|E
25|$|Located along Green Street, <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> {{district}} {{serves as}} the entertainment and retail center for students at the University of Illinois. This area has been undergoing change since 2002 with {{the completion of a}} new $7 million streetscape project. Campustown is now attracting new retail and entertainment stores as well as serving as the center for new construction projects. Several new projects opened in 2008 including the 18-story Burnham 310 high-rise and grocery store at 4th and Springfield, and a new 24-story apartment building called 309 Green.|$|E
25|$|Use of the Wilderness Road fell {{when the}} National Road was opened in 1818, {{allowing}} {{travel to the}} Ohio River on more level ground from the East. The Panic of 1837, geology and new railroad technology doomed the James River Canal, once envisioned as augmenting <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> route. At the same time, the steamboat first appeared on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, allowing faster and cheaper travel both {{up and down the}} rivers. During the 1850s, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was constructed along part of this route.|$|E

Two new shopping centers have been created in the area since 2005, Shops at Abilene and Abilene Marketplace, though the latter currently only has one tenant. Also, Buffalo Gap Road and Ridgemont Drive have been a constant area for retail and business and still continues to develop. Here the Mall of Abilene has been a strong spur for commerce since the 1980s, after it was constructed in 1979. Contained is a list of several new businesses brought to <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> district {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
25|$|The Canal {{relied on}} wheat and wine traffic in Languedoc which was its main purpose. <b>This</b> <b>commercial</b> traffic {{had the effect}} of {{enriching}} the descendants of Riquet very quickly. The wheat, wine, and alcohol could be exported from Lauragais to Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Marseille. The canal {{had the effect of}} broadening the sales area of the producers of Languedoc. In the 1730s commerce thrived and greatly improved agricultural businesses. The canal also allowed the import to Languedoc of products from other regions such as Marseille soap, rice, starch, dried fish, and spices and dyes. However, it was never the grand international route envisaged by the kings of France as its traffic was limited to local and national trade.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 {{initiated}} the Nanban trade period, with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the arquebus, European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled <b>this</b> <b>commercial</b> vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk. However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.|$|E
