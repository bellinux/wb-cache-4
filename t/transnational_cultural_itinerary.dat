40|$|The Cultural Routes {{programme}} of the Council of Europe aims {{at increasing}} cultural exchange, enhancing a European identity, stimulating tourism and supporting sustainable development by promoting cultural heritage under one theme, thus creating <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>itineraries</b> like the Phoenicians’ Route. This requires a complex structure based on cooperation and complementation, involving multiple stakeholders and making its implementation potentially uncertain {{due to its}} intricate machinery. These are the original ideas behind the research question around which the investigation is centered: to what extent have {{the goals of the}} Phoenicians’ Route, added in 2003 to the Cultural Routes programme of the Council of Europe, been achieved in Spain? By means of a literature review and a series of interviews conducted to key participants, I have concluded that the Phoenicians’ Route in Spain is at an initial stage of implementation. This is indicated firstly by the general unawareness I have perceived, both when preparing for the interviews and through the responses, and secondly by the direct answers of the interviewees. I suggest the problem is the confederation model on which the Phoenicians’ Route is based because it prompts uncomittement, disorganisation and an unequal implementation. This could be solved by incorporating a central figure with influential competence power that could animate the operators...|$|R
40|$|Cultural tourism has the {{potential}} to create multiple positive impacts from the socio-cultural point of view; if properly managed. The strengthening of cultural identity and the rescue of tangible and intangible cultural heritage are some examples. A study by the European Commission and the Council of Europe highlighted {{the potential}} of cultural routes for the generation of small businesses, intercultural dialogue and the promotion of the image of Europe in general. In the last decade, numerous projects and, in particular, European funds have been devoted to the creation of themed-tourism products and cultural routes. This is the case of the Umayyad Route, which has been rescued through a project funded by the European Union with the aim of improving Mediterranean territorial cohesion through the creation of the <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> tourism <b>itinerary.</b> It is led by the Public Andalusian Foundation El legado andalusí and it has a network of partners in seven countries in the Mediterranean basin: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan. Through interviews with the coordinating entity and the managers of the national routes, this article analyses how the Umayyad Route is contributing to the enhancement of the rich legacy of the Umayyad dynasty in its expansion along the Mediterranean and to being a bridge of collaboration between the East and the West. It also describes the problems and challenges to overcome for the promotion of shared heritage and for the understanding between cultures and territories.  </p...|$|R

Drawing on a study of middle-class European mothers in London, it shows how they mobilise <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> resources to compensate for shortcomings of economic, national and local cultural capital, as well as accruing added value to their children’s education. Indeed, some mothers engage in <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> currency speculation of cultural resources by converting the educational investment in their children into educational credentials in the national setting where they expect the highest returns.

The Vietnamese community in America is for the most part anticommunist, due to two main factors: their negative past experiences with the Vietnamese communists, and the current undemocratic political situation in Vietnam, one of a few communist countries left in the world. Based in America, but shaped by experiences and conditions in Vietnam, Vietnamese Americans' politics are transnational. In the global world today, Vietnamese Americans are connected with their home country though many <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> channels. This thesis describes how anticommunist politics affect the <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> lives of Vietnamese Americans, particularly in their consumption of cultural products from Vietnam. The relation is complex and contains disjunctures. While some Vietnamese Americans completely reject <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> products from Vietnam, many consume them, but might screen the information through their political viewpoints. Arjun Appadurai's transnational concept of global cultural flows can help understand and analyze such <b>transnational</b> politics and <b>cultural</b> experiences.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} <b>cultural</b> <b>itineraries</b> {{as a new}} {{category}} of heritage, a specific product {{for the promotion of}} cultural tourism in inland regions and a tool for defending small settlements from depopulation. The study describes the main characteristics of <b>cultural</b> <b>itineraries,</b> considering the factors that influence their creation and the strategies to adopt in order   for them to realistically have a future and generate sustainable tourism in the regions through which the routes pass. In order   for a <b>cultural</b> <b>itinerary</b> to be successful it is clearly indispensable to highlight the meaning of the ancient road but it is also necessary to identify the importance that it has today and can have in the future. Following the path taken by St Peter the Apostle towards Rome, this paper reconstructs stretches of that ancient itinerary, which has been historically and geographically documented. It proposes to highlight the value of a journey that undoubtedly appeals to those who are full of intellectual enthusiasm but appears to have little relevance for the faithful. Indeed, the latter have always been primarily interested in the journey’s final  destination, i. e. the great devotional route inside the Eternal City. Conferring importance on the Way of St Peter from Jerusalem to Rome would certainly help promote the inland areas of southern Italy that conserve traces of the saint’s presence. However, it would also perhaps succeed in restoring pride and confidence in this important ancient cultural presence to the Mare Nostrum and in recognising the Way’s key role in initiating intercultural dialogue and cooperation between Europe and the Mediterranean countries.  </p...|$|R

30|$|The author {{once used}} “transnational {{cultural}} sphere” to examine trans-regional ethnic groups including Han Chinese.

In the process of globalization, an important criterion for same-rooted <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> recognition is the cultural identity and heritage of overseas Chinese. However, overseas Chinese communities and cultures cannot be simply viewed as an overseas extension of native Chinese culture. On the contrary, they {{are a result of}} gradual localization of native Chinese culture through “cultural adaptation” to the local society. For example, the Southeast Asian Chinese community is not “transplanted” from the native society, but rather historically reconstructed in the local social context (Ma, 2000).The production and localization of Chinese culture, to a certain extent, strengthens the cultural identity of the native country, Southeast Asia and the <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> sphere.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{cultural}} globalisation {{does not always}} imply cultural homogenisation. Rather, {{it can be seen}} as a process of cultural ‘glocalisation’ and hybridisation where cultures continuously interact with and interpret each other to engender a hybrid cultural form. As Arjun Appadurai (1993) contends, neither centrality nor peripherality of culture exists in the context of <b>cultural</b> globalisation. Rather, <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> forms are likely to circulate in multiple directions. This is particularly evident when examining Gothic & Lolita – a Japanese fashion trend which has emerged since the late 1990 s. Applying Jan Nederveen Pieterse’s theory of ‘globalisation as hybridisation’ (2004), and Roland Robertson’s concept of ‘glocalisation’ (1995), this article attempts to explore how this fashion trend manifests the process of cultural ‘glocalisation’, hybridisation, and interaction through the localisation of Western Goth subculture and especially, historical European dress styles in Japan. In addition, it explores how the fashion signifies the idea of ‘reverse’ flow of culture through an ethnographic observation of an English-speaking online community devoted to the trend. The analysis of the online community also seeks to establish the idea that this <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> flow serves as an alternative to the local culture...|$|R

African cultural studies marginality in the global discourse is rearticulated as both a positioning of disempowerment {{on the one hand and}} one of generative and insurgent politics on the other. Stressing the need for continental and diasporic Africans to self-identify issues to be addressed (in place Eurocentric, imposed preoccupations), the essay identifies as examples the always already complex nature of identity and belonging (and the irony of emergent zenophobia); continental and diasporic relations that trouble the taken for grantedness of what constitutes Africa(ns), and queer Africa in the face of institutionalized homophobia. Whether local nativist or globally engaged approaches are taken, the essay concludes, African cultural studies ought to be self-reflexively, dedicated not only to doing cultural studies but to what the doing of African cultural studies does for Africa(ns) and for <b>transnational</b> <b>cultural</b> studies...|$|R
