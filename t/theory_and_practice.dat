5|$|The book {{debuted in}} America on November 7, 1960 {{during the week}} of John Kennedy's election. At the time of the book's release, Neill was unknown in the United States, and not a single {{bookseller}} purchased an advance copy. Summerhill brought him international renown over the next decade. The book sold 24,000 copies in its first year, 100 thousand in 1968, 200 thousand in 1969, two million total by 1970, and three million by 1973. Summerhill was included in over 600 American university courses, and a 1969 translation for West Germany (The <b>Theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>Practice</b> of Anti-Authoritarian Education) sold over a million copies in three years. In the wake of the book's success, publisher Harold Hart started the American Summerhill Society in New York City, of which Paul Goodman was a founding member.|$|E
5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between <b>theory</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E
