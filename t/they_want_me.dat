500|$|After Lennon became famous, she berated him for {{speaking}} in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: [...] "That's showbusiness, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to speak more Liverpool". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E

500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are you sure <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> for this episode because I can't seem to find me?' And then I get to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E
500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing ... <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|Following {{her first}} {{appearance}} in 1969, Driver remained {{in the role of}} Betty continuously. She suggested in 1999 that if she gave up she would die [...] "within a month from sheer boredom". In a 2006 interview she laughed off the notion of retirement, saying: [...] "From day one on The Street everyone has been very kind to me. In fact, I'm godmother to Bill Roache's son. So as long as <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me,</b> I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was {{very much a part of}} plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations. Driver died on 15 October 2011, having appeared in over 2,800 episodes of Coronation Street.|$|E

500|$|Smith, aged 13 at the time, {{signed a}} record-breaking multi-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz in December 2008, {{six months after}} {{finishing}} outside the top three in the Britain's Got Talent series two final. Her debut album, Faryl, was released in March 2009. Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label. I'm really happy that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to do another album so soon – I didn't think I would be working on one so quickly after the first one was released ... I'm just excited to get under way with it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me,</b> I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E
500|$|September began for Benfica with a {{visit to}} Leiria. It was a hard-fought match, in which referee José Leirós gave out twelve bookings. They {{narrowly}} escaped defeat when Chano scored in stoppage time. Benfica started their European season on 14 September in Sweden, with a 1–2 loss to host Halmstads. Benfica won their second home game of the season, on 18 September, against Estrela da Amadora, thanks to two goals scored by Van Hooijdonk in consecutive minutes {{near the end of}} regulation time. In the post-match interview, following weeks of fan pressure, club manager Heynckes lost his calm and proclaimed: [...] "I can't take this club anymore. If <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> gone, I'll leave tomorrow." [...] He was immediately let go, and replaced with 37-year-old José Mourinho. Former player Mozer joined him as assistant. It was Mourinho's first time as manager, having previously worked only as an interpreter for Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal. His first game as manager was on the road against Boavista, in which his team lost 0–1 to a goal from ex-Benfica player Duda. The second leg of the UEFA Cup was a home game played on 28 September at the Estádio da Luz. It ended in a 2–2 draw and they were eliminated from the tournament – a result reminiscent of their 1997–98 season.|$|E

500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

[...] In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, [...] "If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you."
