40|$|Using {{a sample}} of firms with traded call options over the 1976 - 1995 period, we provide {{evidence}} consistent with call option prices anticipating stock returns over subsequent <b>trading</b> <b>weeks.</b> Stocks that option market participants consistently rank as future “good ” (‘bad”) performers in a given <b>trading</b> <b>week</b> subsequently reveal these levels of performance in the stock market. This subsequent “good ” (“bad”) performance tends to be preceded by weeks of “bad” (“good”) performance. We then form calendar time portfolios of stocks based on extreme IPD performance in the preceding seven weeks. We find abnormal returns of approximately 10 basis points per week associated with the zero-investment portfolios so constructed. This is of the same order of magnitude as the zero-investment return documented for other anomalies of economic significance, namely size, book-to-market, price and earnings momentum for the same period. Our conclusion at this stage is that call option prices can yield economically significant information about future stock returns. 2...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 17 th February 2019. This paper finds {{significant}} evidence that commodity log price changes can predict industry-level returns for horizons {{of up to}} six <b>trading</b> <b>weeks</b> (30 days). We find that for the 1985 - 2010 period, 40 out of 49 U. S. industries can be predicted {{by at least one}} commodity. Our findings are consistent with Hong and Stein’s (1999) “underreaction hypothesis. ” Unlike prior literature, we pinpoint the length of underreaction by employing daily data. We provide a comprehensive examination of the return linkages among 25 commodities and 49 industries. This provides a more detailed investigation of underreaction and investor inattention hypotheses than most related literature. Finally, we implement data-mining robust methods to assess the statistical significance of industry returns reactions to commodity log price changes, with precious metals (such as gold) featuring most prominently. While our results indicate modest out-of-sample forecast ability, they confirm evidence that commodity data can predict equity returns more than four <b>trading</b> <b>weeks</b> ahead...|$|R
