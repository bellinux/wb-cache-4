The focus is on the Torra Conservancy in the north-western part of Namibia. The specific objectives are to assess the relative degree to which the local communities have had control in the community-based tourism (CBT) through the community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) programme in terms of rights, empowerment and economic benefits. The study involves a retrospective review of literature on integrative tourism and <b>rural</b> <b>local</b> <b>development</b> and through a survey of key community based tourism (CBT) actors in Bergsig and in Windhoek, Namibia. This study is mainly based on quantitative approach. In addition, thematic interviews were used, where possible, to understand and deepen the views expressed in the survey results. Respondents representing the three main clusters of the tourism industry; government, private sector and the host local communities were examined on their interpretation of the current development of the tourism industry in Namibia. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and factor analysis indicated statistical significant differences between different groups. The research findings revealed that the extent to which local communities participate in the tourism development process depends on the idealistic, and perhaps to some degree unrealistic, expectations, of community-based tourism in the national tourism policy spectrum. Since community perceptions match what is on the ground from development, problems are socially real and necessitated a viable solution for amelioration. Implications are discussed for building a more integrative policy approach that could help guide research, planning, development and evaluation of community-based tourism projects.

In addition we show that the distance from the main urban poles is a disadvantage for the development of a large part of the south rural areas of the Manche Department and some contiguous EPCI from the southwest of the Orne Department.

In that case, the term ‘organic’ could be assumed to be a heuristic cue. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine whether the heuristic role of the term ‘organic’ can indeed be assumed and to confirm the mediatory role of this type of food.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to prove that rural tourism can be an {{essential}} means of bringing about the development of regions where there is a significant socio-economic imbalance. In Spain, there are still many rural areas with low levels of income and productivity. Production in these areas generally revolves around economic activities that are directly linked to the primary sector, with high rates of unemployment. They therefore need to diversify their income. Our research includes fieldwork carried out in the Priego de C—rdoba region, where three types of econometric models have been developed. These tend to model the demand for rural tourism in this area in an attempt to forecast short- and medium-term demand and consider whether sustained growth is possible through an economic culture based on the development of tourism and efficient management of natural resources. <b>Rural</b> tourism, <b>local</b> <b>development,</b> econometric model, <b>rural</b> areas, Andalusia. ...|$|R

Especially in the Global South the increasing tourism demand has been seen highly beneficial as evolving tourism can create direct and indirect income and employment effects to the host regions and previously marginalised communities, with potential to aid with the poverty reduction targets. This research note reviews the existing policy and planning frameworks in relation to tourism and rural development in Namibia. Especially the policy aims towards rural community development are overviewed with focus on Community-Based Tourism (CBT) initiatives. The research note involves a retrospective review of tourism policies and <b>rural</b> <b>local</b> <b>development</b> initiatives in Namibia where the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) initiated a community-based tourism policy. The policy emphasises structures and processes helping local communities {{to benefit from the}} tourism sector, and the active and coordinating involvement of communities, especially, is expected to ensure that the benefits of tourism trickle down to the local level where tourist activities take place. However, it is noted that in addition to public policy-makers also other tourism developers and private business environment in Namibia need to recognize the full potential of rural tourism development {{in order to meet the}} created politically driven promises at the policy level. In this respect, a national tourism policy could provide an enabling framework, integrating the tourism sector’s development aims to rural and community development needs in future. In addition, there is a need to coordinate a comprehensive vision of what type of rural tourism development or tourism in rural environments holds the most potential to benefit both local communities and the mainstream sector.

Human pressure and surrounding natural constraints are {{the main cause of}} the rupture of the fragile equilibrium of ecological systems and the movement of rural exodus towards the plains and local towns. The case of mountainous “déchras” in the north of the Down-valley in the north of Tunisia (Toukabeur, Chaouach and Hidous) offers a manifest example of the grave structural crisis which the Mediterranean mountains suffer at present. The disequilibrium of the relationship population- resources push the dwellers of the mountains to develop short and long term strategies of adaptation, carried out through a traditional management of the rural space. The poor outputs of the latter led to {{the emergence of a new}} tendency towards a restructuring of familial activities by giving a greater importance to multi-activity and extra –agricultural employment.

40|$|Our paper explores, on a {{theoretical}} level, {{the reason for}} frequent failures of rural development policies and identifies some potential improvements in rural policy making in Europe. Our approach to des/integration concerns actors, resources, institutions, knowledge, the fundamental logic of development, and the interplay between two distinct levels of rural development: the level of policies, or central intervention; {{and the level of}} local aspirations aimed at improving everyday rural life. Along these lines, two characteristic systems of rural development – the central bureaucratic and the local heuristic – can be clearly identified. Ideally, these should work in co-operation, complementing each other, forming an integrated development system, where rural policy serves to (i) channel resources, establish strategic aims and development models in a top-down mode, and (ii) convey information and mediate social, economic, political interests in a bottom-up mode. However, lack of integration and divergence of interest can lead to dysfunction, conflict and dissipation within the system. We argue that rural development policies tend to fail because the central bureaucratic system imposes top-down control and objectives throughout the development process, thus failing to sufficiently promote the reconfiguration of local resources, which is better achieved through bottom-up processes and the local heuristic system. In other words, the tendency to disjunction between the two basic socio-political systems of rural development is the main reason for the failure of rural development policy. The paper offers analytical models of integrated and non-integrated rural development systems and illustrates the argument through some examples taken from the community initiatives and the pre-accession policies of the European Union. The study is in two halves. The first half elaborates the concept of ‘integrated rural development’. based on international literature. The second part offers a few new conceptions, as a contribution to the ‘new rural development theory’ and simple models of integrated and non-integrated <b>development.</b> <b>Rural</b> <b>development,</b> <b>local</b> <b>development,</b> <b>rural</b> policy, European Union, LEADER Programme, centre-periphery, local governance...|$|R
