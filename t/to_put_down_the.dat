5|$|Emperor Nero then {{appointed}} Vespasian <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, who {{landed in}} Judaea with fifth and tenth legions in 67. He was later joined {{by his son}} Titus at Ptolemais, who brought with him the fifteenth legion.

5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} unfair to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Conqueror, Thomas was loyal to the third son, William Rufus, who had {{inherited}} England instead of the eldest brother, Robert Curthose. Thomas supported Rufus despite a rebellion led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux, and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolt. Thomas attended the subsequent trial for rebellion in 1088 of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had sided with Odo. William was Thomas' sole suffragan bishop, but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court.|$|E

25|$|Hawkwood honored his {{agreement}} with the Florentines not to make war in Tuscany, limiting himself <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> various rebellions within the papal states; in 1377 Hawkwood abandoned Gregory XI entirely and joined the anti-papal coalition. Gregory XI's other condottieri also limited their activities to Romagna, notably sacking Cesena in February 1377. In the spring of 1377, papal mercenaries recaptured Bologna, which up until that point had been a key Florentine ally.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Warsaw uprising (a task that ultimately {{was carried out by}} the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, France sent {{most of the}} disgruntled legionnaires (two demi-brigades, 5,280 strong) to Haiti <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Haitian Revolution (on the Caribbean {{island of}} Haiti, known then as Saint Domingue, the French West Indies). Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue, but {{preferred}} to save his main French army for more important matters, closer to home. The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents of Germans and Swiss French allies, {{as well as by}} French units that had fallen out of favour with Napoleon and the French high command.|$|E
5|$|In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was {{the site}} of the Red River Rebellion, a {{conflict}} between the local provisional government of Métis, led by Louis Riel, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General Garnet Wolseley was sent <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> uprising. The Manitoba Act of 1870 made Manitoba the fifth province of the three-year-old Canadian Confederation. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. Métis legislator and interpreter James McKay named the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, São Paulo and Minas Geraes helped <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{first of}} the Tenente revolts. Soldiers seized Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro on 5 July, but no other men joined them. As a result, some men deserted the rebels, and {{by the next morning}} only 200 people {{remained}} in the fort. São Paulo bombarded the fort, firing five salvos and obtaining at least two hits; the fort surrendered half an hour later. The Brazilian Navy's official history reports that one of the hits opened a hole ten meters deep.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although it was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On {{the eve of the}} Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|In 66, the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted {{against the}} Roman Empire. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, {{was forced to}} retreat from Jerusalem and {{defeated}} {{at the battle of}} Beth-Horon. The pro-Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to the Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Nero appointed Vespasian <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions. He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais, bringing with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across the Galilee, and by 68 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, {{a violent}} {{railroad}} strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, sparking riots in other American cities, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized {{the use of}} the military <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rioting. During the crisis, Tilley was temporarily transferred to , sailing up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters from Baltimore could travel to Washington to seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington, including army, navy, and marines, were organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore. Within a short time, the riots in other cities were also quashed.|$|E

5|$|Antiochus VII Sidetes (r.138–129BC), {{a brother}} of Demetrius, assumed the Seleucid throne and married the latter's wife Cleopatra Thea. After {{defeating}} Diodotus Tryphon, Antiochus initiated a campaign in 130BC to retake Mesopotamia, {{now under the}} rule of Phraates II of Parthia (r.c.138–128BC). The Parthian general Indates was defeated along the Great Zab, followed by a local uprising where the Parthian governor of Babylonia was killed. Antiochus conquered Babylonia and occupied Susa, where he minted coins. After advancing his army into Media, the Parthians pushed for peace, which Antiochus refused to accept unless the Arsacids relinquished all lands to him except Parthia proper, paid heavy tribute, and released Demetrius from captivity. Arsaces released Demetrius and sent him to Syria, but refused the other demands. By spring 129BC, the Medes were in open revolt against Antiochus, whose army had exhausted the resources of the countryside during winter. While attempting <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolts, the main Parthian force swept into the region and killed Antiochus in battle. His body was sent back to Syria in a silver coffin; his son Seleucus was made a Parthian hostage and a daughter joined Phraates' harem.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{kept the}} control of the nation firmly within the hands of his {{brothers}} and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a paratroop revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were exempt from land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were de facto exempt from performing corvée labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The Senate that convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a Republican majority for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|The English Parliament distrusted Charles's motivations when {{he called}} for funds <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Irish rebellion; {{many members of the}} Commons {{suspected}} that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. Pym's Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into anarchy, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action.|$|E
5|$|The Seleucid {{suppression}} of Jewish religious life met with considerable resistance among the native population. While Antiochus was occupied {{in the east}} during 167BCE, a rural priest, Mattathias of Modiin, raised a rebellion against the empire. Both the Seleucid administration and the local Hellenized faction failed to grasp {{the magnitude of the}} revolt. In 164BCE Judas Maccabaeus liberated Jerusalem and reconsecrated the Temple. Although the surrounding city had fallen, the Acra and its inhabitants held out. Maccabaeus besieged the fortress, whose inhabitants sent an appeal to the Seleucid king (now AntiochusV) for assistance. A Seleucid army was dispatched <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> revolt. When it laid siege to Beth-Zur, Maccabaeus was forced to abandon his siege of the Acra and face Antiochus in battle. In the subsequent Battle of Beth-Zechariah, the Seleucids won their first victory over the Maccabees, and Maccabaeus was forced to withdraw. Spared from capitulation, the Acra persisted as a Seleucid stronghold for 20 more years during which it weathered several Hasmonean attempts to oust the Greek garrison.|$|E
