40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{research}} paper {{is based on}} the perception of people over the death by HIV and Aids. It looks at the impact of culture and beliefs on the management <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> in the community and also in the country as whole. This research aims to establish the root course of covering death of by HIV and Aids, often due to fear of discrimination and isolation. Communities need to be educated on discrimination and stigma that comes about with people living with HIV and Aids. This study was conducted at Mvelaphanda Primary School children, in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng, South Africa. The main focus was on the death of parents of the learners at the school and ultimately learners themselves, who some of them where born with HIV epidemic. Some of the children became orphans of the disease. The collection of data was in three fold: questionnaire, interview and observation and discussions. The information gathered was manipulated to bring about the expected results. Analysis of the data indicated that where there is no behavioral and attitude change, there would be more death by the pandemic than ever before. It is the responsibility of everyone, be it heads of families, religious leaders, politicians, business people and teachers to fight against <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> pandemic. This study has also discovered that medical report on the cause of death is concealed in order for policies to payout. This distortion of information does not help in the fight against <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> All stakeholders should work together in the support of those will disclose their status without fear of rejection, isolation and discriminated against. Schools, churches and community gatherings should be better used as a plat-form for that. If such conditions are created <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HIV will be reduced and the prevention strategy will succeed. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die navorsing handel oor die persepsie van mense teenoor dood as gevolg van MIV/Vigs. Dit ondersoek die impak van kultuur en geloof op die bestuur van MIV/Vigs binne 'n gemeenskap in die besonder en binne die land in die algemeen. Die doel van die navorsing was om die grondoorsaak waarom daar dikwels gediskrimeer word teenoor persone wat sterf weens MIV te identifiseer en om te bepaal waarom mense wat met MIV leef dikwels “uitgewerp” word uit die gemeenskap. Die studie is gedoen by die Mvelaphanda Primêre Skool in Tembisa, in die Ekuhuleni Metropool van die Gauteng provinsie van Suid-Afrika. Die primêre fokus van die studie was op die invloed wat die dood as gevolg van Vigs op die kinders in die skool gehad het. Data is ingesamel deur middel van vraelyste en onderhoude asook deur waarneming en besprekings. Ontleding van die data het aangetoon dat indien daar nie positiewe gedragverandering plaasvind nie, daar meer sterftes as gevolg van Vigs verwag kan word. Daar word aanbevelings gemaak oor hoe belangroepe kan meehelp om stigma en diskriminasie te verminder en sodoende kan meehelp om die verdere verspreiding van die pandemie te beperk...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Th.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2007. Women in the Mutima Church in Zambia {{have for}} some years had the highest HIV rate in the church, but because {{this is one of}} the African Indigenous Churches (AICs), not much is known about the {{behavioural}} and other risk factors that predispose these women to the virus. One of the reasons is that some members of the Mutima Church cannot make their own decisions when getting married. The church founder makes marital decisions for some of the church members. This problem raises serious questions for HIV health practitioners, activists and some of the church members. Informed by some of the Mutima Church members that HIV testing in their church is not considered a norm, this dissertation demonstrates theological teachings on polygamy and HIV and Aids employed by the church founder. In this dissertation, some church members from the Mutima Church were asked to describe and explain what polygamy and HIV and Aids meant to them and how they theologically perceived and understood them. While the major results indicate that polygamy in the Mutima Church contributes to <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids,</b> <b>the</b> other new research findings are that the Mutima Church members' theological understanding on polygamy is that it is a blessing from God; and that HIV and Aids is a punishment from God.

The respondents teaching methods vary, but a common method is that external persons are invited to school to give lectures. Another common method is that students teach their classmates about the virus. In matter of how the students can protect themselves against the disease, abstinence seems to be the primary and overarching message while condom use tends to be the secondary and subordinating message in classroom.

40|$|The study {{seeks to}} explore and {{identify}} factors that prevent AIDS orphans in presenting themselves for Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT). Socio-cultural factors, notably, stigma and the resultant discrimination by community members, have been presented by many researchers as the main aetiological factors that hinder the use of VCT by AIDS orphans. It is {{on the basis of}} this that this study was conducted to identify factors that hinder AIDS orphans from accessing VCT. The study used a qualitative approach following an explorative and descriptive, contextual research design and was conducted at Ubuntu Education Fund, Port Elizabeth. Purposive sampling was used to determine a sample of AIDS orphans. Participants of the study had to be orphaned as a result of AIDS, isiXhosa-speaking, between 12 - 17 years, living in the care of a primary care-giver and had not presented themselves for VCT. Data was collected by means of semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews are suitable in cases where the researcher is interested in an issue that is complex or personal (De Vos, Strydom, Fouche and Deloport, 2005). Data was analyzed according to the framework provided by Tesch (1990) as described in Creswell (2003). The major findings of this study were that people are locked in a ‘poverty-of-the mind cycle’, in respect of HIV and AIDS, and this is exacerbated by educational impoverishment and general poverty. The recommendations that emanated from this study are made from policy and service delivery perspectives. It is recommended that in order for AIDS orphans to access VCT they should be developed and empowered through sustainable programmes that enhance their capacities to the outmost realization of their potential. It is also recommended that health and other professionals should encourage AIDS orphans and community members to present themselves for VCT and thus curb <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>AID...</b>|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the constraints for successful mine waste dump revegetation at the Bulong Nickel Operation (BNO) in the arid Eucalyptus woodlands of the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. The chemical properties of two waste dump substrates (overburden) and one sub-soil at BNO were investigated to determine the nature of the material and its suitability for growth of two local species, the legume, Acacia acuminata ssp. burkittii and the salt tolerant blue bush, Maireana pyramidata. The most serious constraint affecting successful plant growth on the waste dumps at BNO was the inhospitable nature of the overburden used to construct the dumps. Maireana tolerated the sodicity and salinity of the waste dump substrate but grew poorly especially on one of the substrates that contained very high levels of 0. 01 M CaCl 2 -extractable Ni. Many Acacia plants died on this substrate. The difficulty with growing plants satisfactorily in the pot experiment suggested that the establishment of sustainable ecosystems capable of restoring arid landscape function would be difficult on these materials. Current rehabilitation plans envisage the creation of waste dumps using this material and placing a 15 -cm layer of topsoil over the top as a seedbed for germination and plant growth. In the short term <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> topsoil will <b>aid</b> plant establishment however once plant roots penetrate sodic, high Ni waste dump material it is possible that only salt tolerant and Ni tolerant species will persist. Further research is required to investigate the effect of gypsum and organic matter on the physical properties of the material and the subsequent effect on plant growth. However, it is strongly recommended that systematic characterisation of the sub-soils and overburden materials at BNO be undertaken to determine if more benign substrates can be identified in the mine waste steam and used for revegetation...|$|R
40|$|D. Phil. This enquiry {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} understand {{the ways in which}} the ecology of ideas surrounding HIV and Aids in post-apartheid South Africa functions discursively to silence people living with the dis-ease. In this regard, it seeks to understand how the range of subject positions available to people with HIV and Aids influences their opportunities for treatment and disclosure. The meanings emerging from this enquiry have implications for interventions aimed at people living with HIV and Aids, in that they challenge the liberal humanism underpinning a Western individualist paradigm which constructs people as ‘rational’ and ‘responsible’ on the basis that such constructions tend to attribute guilt or moral culpability to people living with HIV and Aids. The conversations and narratives elicited in the process of this enquiry suggest that such discourses constitute a form of disciplinary power in a Foucauldian sense, positioning people living with HIV and Aids defensively and limiting their options for ‘positive’ self-definition by foreclosing available subject positions, thereby contributing to <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids.</b> Hence, this enquiry focuses on social constructions of morality and the impact of these on participants’ attempts to maintain key relationships that afford them a ‘positive’ sense of them-selves. Thus, it looks at experiences of connection and dis-connection and explores the ways in which efforts to retain ‘relatedness’ in order to maximise possibilities for the co-construction of a ‘moral self’ mediate opportunities for disclosure and treatment options. The enquiry aimed to assist participants in deconstructing dominant social constructions <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids</b> implicit in cultural and political discourse by applying a critical, poststructuralist and discourse-analytic lens in order that they might resist moral attributions based on liberal humanism and access their own voices in narrating the experience of living with HIV and Aids in keeping with their lived experience. My aim in this regard was to resurrect alternative or previously silenced accounts and to open up spaces for a multiplicity of meanings associated with HIV and Aids to emerge and be heard, toward the end of breaking the silence and creating a conversational space in which people’s meanings could simultaneously be heard and challenged through dialogue. Ultimately, this enquiry highlights the importance of attempting to understand the local and idiosyncratic nature of people’s constructions <b>of</b> HIV and <b>Aids,</b> which are often a hybrid mix of ideas and meanings circulating within social, cultural and political discourse. It also underscores the salience of considering people’s lives in context and particularly their need to maintain relationships that afford a positive sense of self. This is reflected in the tendency for participants to construct their identities in relation to significant others and for these relationships to mediate decision making in relation to HIV and Aids by availing or foreclosing certain subject positions, depending on the discourses within which they are situated...|$|R
