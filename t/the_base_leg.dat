50|$|At 19:57, Funchal {{cleared the}} crew to descend to 3500 ft and {{informed}} them that the QNH was 1014.0 mb. Apparently, during the landing checklist, the crew forgot to set the altimeter to that value, and proceeded to the final 180° turn to the downwind leg well below the correct altitude, losing sight of the runway lights. Relying only on instruments, the pilot descended below the 720 ft required during circling and reached <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> below 200 ft, impacting the sea soon after that. At the time of impact, the altimeter was reading 500 ft. The aircraft had its landing gear down and the flaps were extended at 20 degrees.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Based</b> on <b>the</b> {{importance}} of the robot {{for the elderly and}} the disabled, a quadruped walking robot using 3 -RPS parallel mechanism as the basic leg mechanism is proposed. The structure of the basic leg is described, and the whole structure of the quadruped walking robot is formed. Then taking the workspace of the basic leg as the standard, the optimum size parameters of the upper platform and the lower platform of <b>the</b> <b>based</b> <b>leg</b> are achieved. Meanwhile the workspace of the basic leg is obtained by the anti-solution search method. Taking the basic leg as analysis object and applying the virtual organization method, the kinematic expression is got. All of these analyses lay a theoretical foundation for the further study on the quadruped walking robot with parallel leg mechanism...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} fundamental distance measurements come from trigonometric parallax. As the Earth orbits the Sun, {{the position of}} nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in an isosceles triangle, with 2 AU (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> of the triangle and {{the distance to the}} star being the long equal length legs. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 arcsecond for an object at the 1 parsec (3.26 light-years) distance of the nearest stars, and thereafter decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases. Astronomers usually express distances in units of parsecs (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media.|$|E
5000|$|These {{approaches}} {{include both}} ground-based and satellite-based systems and include criteria for terminal areas (TAAs), basic approach criteria, and final approach criteria. The TAA is {{a transition from}} the en route structure to the terminal environment which provides minimum altitudes for obstacle clearance. The TAA is a [...] "T" [...] or [...] "basic T" [...] design with left and right base leg IAFs on initial approach segments perpendicular to the intermediate approach segment {{where there is a}} dual purpose IF/IAF for a straight-in procedure (no procedure turn NoPT), or hold-in-lieu-of procedure-turn (HILO) course reversal. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> IAFs is 3 to 6 NM from the IF/IAF. The basic-T is aligned with the runway centerline, with the IF 5 NM from the FAF, and the FAF is 5 NM from the threshold.|$|E
50|$|Le Duc Tan, {{a ranger}} in the South Vietnamese army who had {{recently}} been demoted from captain to lieutenant for the theft of two cars in Da Nang, smooth-talked his way past security checkpoints. After taking off from Da Nang in South Vietnam on a regularly scheduled flight for Saigon, the flight was hijacked by Tan, holding two grenades. He demanded to be flown to Hanoi in North Vietnam. For unknown reasons the pilots approached the airfield at Phan Rang but aborted the landing. The aircraft overshot <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> and initiated a left turn, during which the aircraft lost control. Shortly after that, the airplane plunged to the ground from an altitude of 1000 ft, killing all 75 people aboard. Even though the exact cause remains unclear, it has been speculated that the hijacker caused the crash by setting off his grenades after the pilots refused {{to give in to}} his demands.|$|E

50|$|While many airfields {{operate a}} {{completely}} standard pattern, {{in other cases}} it will be modified according to need. For example, military airfields often dispense with <b>the</b> crosswind and <b>base</b> <b>legs,</b> but rather fly these as circular arcs directly joining the upwind and downwind sections.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, {{aircraft}} at uncontrolled airports usually {{cross the}} airport at midfield at pattern altitude from the upwind side, turning onto the downwind leg. Although joining straight in downwind {{is also a}} possibility. [...] At controlled airports, the tower typically directs aircraft to join <b>the</b> downwind <b>leg,</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg,</b> or straight into the final leg.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to airliners, {{sailplanes}} fly at low airspeeds. The usual {{approach speed}} of a sailplane is around 50 knots, but lets assume that the pilot is extra [...] "careful" [...] and flies his approach at 65 knots. William Cotton claims that the wind shear can {{be as high as}} 50 knots. In such a case, if the shear direction is such that the airspeed is reduced by the shear amount, this pilots airspeed will drop to 15 knots, which is well below his gliders stall speed (typically 35-40 knots). If this airspeed drop occurs during the transition from <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> to the final approach, the aircraft may enter into a spin from which there isnt enough altitude to recover. The exact quotation is the following: [...] Upon encountering a downburst with say a 50 kt tailwind component, airspeed can drop from say 65 kts to more like 15 kts. If the sailplane is making a turn from baseleg to ﬁnal, the pilot ﬁnds himself (herself) in one of the deadliest situations a pilot can encounter, a [...] "stall-spin" [...] situation with no chance to recover since the aircraft is close to the ground on ﬁnal approach.|$|E
50|$|The Mark I cannon {{was made}} out {{of a set of}} valves, a hose, and a freon tank. Iron pipe {{fittings}} were affixed to the freon 22 tank, which provided the pressure that powered the gun. Small water valves were used to fill the tank, and to supply pressure to an O-ring spool valve. When the gun was not in the fire position, the O-ring separated the pressure source from the magazine hose; however, when the radio control unit was activated the servo moved the spool valve into position, allowing freon to flow from the pressurized tank to the magazine hose. As the magazine was pressurized, BBs flowed into the restrictor tube until the pressure built high enough to force the BBs through the restrictor and out of the barrel. The exit velocity of the BBs was high enough to punch holes in the model ship’s 1/32 inch balsa wood skin. However, this linear magazine and barrel assembly was too bulky to be fit to a small model ship’s gun turret. To improve scale appearance, a brass elbow fitting was added to reduce the above deck size of the gun. This enabled the magazine to exit the deck vertically, with the BBs running into <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> of the elbow before entering the restrictor. This {{led to the development of}} the new Mk II breach/barrel assembly. The first Mk II was installed on Stan Watkins' model of the USS Arizona (l/144 scale). The BBs (about 100) were loaded into a clear hose which, when pressurised, would feed the BBs into a smaller clear plastic tubing behind the barrel brass tubing. The pressure would build until the force pushed the BBs through the restrictor tubing and out the barrel. The force of this design had adequate power to penetrate the 1/32 balsa hull skin. The design of the restrictor caused a number of BBs to “spurt” out each time the pressure was great enough, however to have sufficient pressure to get more than one spurt, the warship combatant had to rapidly close the spool valve after the start of the spurt. This was made possible as the freon feed hoses were very thin, and had low flow.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{flow in the}} Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACON) is a {{significant}} factor in determining airport throughput capacity and airline operational efficiency. In recent years the availability of high fidelity terminal area track data has made it possible to increase the granularity of airport and airspace performance analysis. This paper describes a methodology for airport arrival flow analysis using National Offload Program (NOP) track data. The analysis provides insight into track distances flown and track time for alternate terminal arrival flows (i. e. from the final waypoint in the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the runway threshold via a type of approach). The methodology is applied to 35 days of NOP track data for Chicago TRACON (C 90) for arrivals into MDW. Arrivals into MDW landing to the north-west on 31 C and to the north-east on 4 R exhibit the shortest average track distance (28. 42 NM and 29. 81 NM.). Arrivals landing to the south-east on 13 C exhibit the highest mean track distance of 38. 9 NM. Track distance/time is least for VFR approaches onto all runways. When IMC conditions exist, RNP approaches provide 6 - 10 % savings in track distance/time over ILS approaches. One unexpected result is that RNP approaches exhibit the same variance in track distance/time as ILS approaches. The variance in RNP approaches occurs on the downwind and turn-to-base, while the variance on the ILS approach occurs by “tromboning ” on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> and the turn to final...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Due to economic and operational constraints, there is an increasing demand from aviation operators and training manufacturers to extract maximum training usage from the lower fidelity suite of flight simulators. It is possible to augment low-fidelity flight simulators to achieve equivalent performance compared to high-fidelity setups but at reduced cost and greater mobility. In particular for visual manoeuvres, the virtual reality technique of head-tracking amplification for virtual view control enables full field-of-regard access even with limited field-of-view displays. This research quantified {{the effects of this}} technique on piloting performance, workload and simulator sickness by applying it to a fixed-base, low-fidelity, low-cost flight simulator. In two separate simulator trials, participants had to land a simulated aircraft from a visual traffic circuit pattern whilst scanning for airborne traffic. Initially, a single augmented display was compared to the common triple display setup in front of the pilot. Starting from <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>leg,</b> pilots exhibited tighter turns closer to the desired ground track and were more actively conducting visual scans using the augmented display. This was followed up by a second experiment to quantify the scalability of augmentation towards larger displays and field of views. Task complexity was increased by starting the traffic pattern from the downwind leg. Triple displays in front of the pilot yielded the best compromise delivering flight performance and traffic detection scores just below the triple projectors but without an increase in track deviations and the pilots were also less prone to simulator sickness symptoms. This research demonstrated that head augmentation yields clear benefits of quick user adaptation, low-cost, ease of systems integration, together with the capability to negate the impact of display sizes yet without incurring significant penalties in workload and incurring simulator sickness. The impact of this research is that it facilitates future flight training solutions using this augmentation technique to meet budgetary and mobility requirements. This enables deployment of simulators in large numbers to deliver expanded mission rehearsal previously unattainable within this class of low-fidelity simulators, and with no restrictions for transfer to other training media...|$|E
