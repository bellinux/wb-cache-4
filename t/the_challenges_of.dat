Despite these early light roles, Parker's onscreen charisma and general je ne sais quoi showed, earning Parker comparisons to Paul Newman. In Felon, Parker played a rookie guard dealing with inner turmoil. In 2008's The Secret Life of Bees, Parker played the good-hearted love interest of Alicia Keys' character. Parker's character has to deal with <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> spurned love.

30|$|Small firms {{usually have}} good {{internal}} communications {{and many have}} a dynamic and entrepreneurial management style (Jones and Rowley, 2011). SMEs usually explore new technical spaces. In sum, innovation in small firms can be (more) efficient and effective (Lu and Chen, 2010). On the other hand, many SMEs are not innovative at all. In response to this question, researchers identified key challenges to SMEs innovation including: <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> human resource (proficiency and skill) and learning {{on a small scale}} to increase innovation speed and decrease cost; <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> research and development (R&D) and identifying new emerging technologies; <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> macro-technologies, <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> National Policy and Regulatory Environment; and <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> lack of market information.|$|R

The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E

In stage three, preschool, children struggle to understand the difference between initiative and guilt. Stage four, pre-adolescence, children learn about industriousness and inferiority.

The sixth stage, young adulthood, is when young people gain insight to life when dealing with <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> intimacy and isolation. In stage seven, or middle adulthood, people experience <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>of</b> trying to make a difference (versus self-absorption).

5|$|Archduke Charles {{traveled}} to Villa Pianore {{and asked for}} Zita’s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries {{about the fate of}} the Austrian Empire and <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was relieved to see an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population.

The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with higher scores on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> reconciling this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.|$|E

Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second season provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions have on their careers. Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed was the story line involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.|$|E
