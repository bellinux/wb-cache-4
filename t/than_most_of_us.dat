[...] Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and {{wondered if he was}} merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, [...] "Boyd hustles you through to the end despite all this, but it’s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey." [...] In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: [...] "he is far more generous, forgiving, and free <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He is also more amusing, and more amused by life", thus making an [...] "attractive central character" [...] and Boyd's writing showed [...] "a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism."

2500|$|An earlier 1963 {{study by}} the poet James Radcliffe Squires spoke to the {{distinction}} of Frost as a poet whose verse soars more for the difficulty and skill by which he attains his final visions, than for the philosophical purity of the visions themselves. [...] "'He has written {{at a time when}} the choice for the poet seemed to lie among the forms of despair: Science, solipsism, or the religion of the past century…Frost has refused all of these and in the refusal has long seemed less dramatically committed than others…But no, he must be seen as dramatically uncommitted to the single solution…Insofar as Frost allows to both fact and intuition a bright kingdom, he speaks for many of us. [...] Insofar as he speaks through an amalgam of senses and sure experience so that his poetry seems a nostalgic memory with overtones touching some conceivable future, he speaks better <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> That is to say, as a poet must."' ...|$|E

"I think I {{could give}} you some notion about these things," [...] said Fred Borders, who had been quietly {{listening}} all the time, but never putting in a word, for, as I have said, Fred was a modest bashful man and seldom spoke much.

In a recent paper, Susanne Erk et al. shed light on a possible neural basis for this phenomena.

I invited him to come and stay with us at Southport, as long as he might remain in this vicinity, and accordingly he did come the next day. [...] . On Wednesday we took a pretty long walk together, and sat down in a hollow among the sand-hills, sheltering ourselves from the high cool wind. Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and of everything else that lies beyond human ken. [...] . He has a very high and noble nature, and is better worth immortality <b>than</b> the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> [...] . On Saturday we went to Chester together.

60|$|This intrepid man, George Thurston, died an ignoble death. The brigade was in camp, with {{headquarters}} in {{a grove of}} immense trees. To an upper branch {{of one of these}} a venturesome climber had attached the two ends of a long rope and made a swing with a length of not less than one hundred feet. Plunging downward from a height of fifty feet, along the arc of a circle with such a radius, soaring to an equal altitude, pausing for one breathless instant, then sweeping dizzily backward--no one who has not tried it can conceive the terrors of such sport to the novice. Thurston came out of his tent one day and asked for instruction in the mystery of propelling the swing--the art of rising and sitting, which every boy has mastered. In a few moments he had acquired the trick and was swinging higher <b>than</b> the <b>most</b> experienced <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had dared. We shuddered to look at his fearful flights.|$|R

In fact, I found it painful to read after a while. It was so neatly laid out that I found myself admiring it. It {{seems to have}} been built like an aircraft. It has everything that opens and shuts, has code for just about everything I've ever seen considered on a scheduler, and it's all neatly laid out in clean code and even comments. It also appears to have been coded with an awful lot of effort to ensure it's robust and measurable, with checking and tracing elements at every corner. I started to feel a little embarrassed by what we have as our own Linux kernel. The more I looked at the OpenSolaris code, the more it felt like it pretty much did everything the Linux kernel has been trying to do for ages. Not only that, but it's built like an aircraft, whereas ours looks like a garage job with duct tape by comparison....OpenSolaris looks like an excellent design for a completely different purpose. It's built like a commercial design for commercial purposes that have very different requirements <b>than</b> what <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> use Linux for, but it does appear to have been done so very well. It looks like a goddamn Star Destroyer, and the Linux kernel (scheduler) suddenly looks like the Millennium Falcon.

60|$|At Milan, {{they stopped}} {{long enough to}} snatch {{a glimpse of the}} cathedral, and to take a hasty walk through the pictured glories of the Brera. A vague {{suspicion}} began to cross Herminia's mind, as she gazed at the girlish Madonna of the Sposalizio, that perhaps she wasn't quite as well adapted to love Italy as Switzerland. Nature she understood; was art yet a closed book to her? If so, she would be sorry; for Alan, in whom the artistic sense was largely developed, loved his Italy dearly; {{and it would be a}} real cause of regret to her if she fell short in any way of Alan's expectations. Moreover, at table d'hote that evening, a slight episode occurred which roused to the full once more poor Herminia's tender conscience. Talk had somehow turned on Shelley's Italian wanderings; and a benevolent-looking clergyman opposite, with that vacantly well-meaning smile, peculiar to a certain type of country rector, was apologizing in what he took to be a broad and generous spirit of divine, toleration for the great moral teacher's supposed lapses from the normal rule of tight living. Much, the benevolent-looking gentleman opined, with beaming spectacles, must be forgiven to men of genius. Their temptations no doubt are far keener <b>than</b> with <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> An eager imagination--a vivid sense of beauty--quick readiness to be moved by the sight of physical or moral loveliness--these were palliations, the old clergyman held, of much that seemed wrong and contradictory to our eyes in the lives of so many great men and women.|$|R
