50|$|Although sparse, the archeological {{record of}} the Northern Territory {{provides}} evidence of settlement around 60,000 years ago at Malakunanja and Nauwalabila, although there is controversy surrounding the <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dating</b> of these sites. During this period, sea levels were 100 - 150m lower than at present, and Australia and New Guinea along with large tracts {{of what is now}} the Timor Sea formed one single landmass.|$|E
50|$|Specimens {{collected}} from earlier excavations {{up to the}} present are under analysis by archaeologists volunteering at the Calico site. Many have been confirmed to be geofacts, but some are believed to be potential artifacts and have been cataloged and submitted for <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dating.</b> Currently work is being done on compiling and publishing the most recent finds at the site to be submitted to the local tribes, community and journals for peer review.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermoluminescent</b> (TL) <b>dating</b> {{of ancient}} {{ceramics}} was undertaken by a TL technique named the large grain method. Because {{the sources of}} alpha particles were embedded mainly in the clay fabric {{and the range of}} the particle is less than 23 μm for quartz, the contribution to TL from alpha　particles could be neglected by the treatment of hydrofluoric-acid etching on the surface layer of the sample grain. The accumulated radiation dose from beta and gamma rays originating from the pottery itself and the surrounding soil was measured by means of high sensitive thermoluminescent dosimeter CaSO 4 :Tm. In the present investigation, the colourless grains of greater than 250 μm in diameter obtained from Thai and Japanese potteries were used as samples. The experimental results showed fairly good agreements with the known ages for Japanese potteries...|$|R

40|$|A {{kinetic model}} of zircon {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) has been constructed {{to simulate the}} processes and stages relevant to <b>thermoluminescent</b> <b>dating</b> such as: filling of electron and hole traps during the excitation stage both for natural and laboratory irradiation; the time dependence of fading after laboratory irradiation; TL experiments both after laboratory and natural irradiation. The goal is to inspect qualitative behavior {{of the system and}} to unravel the processes and determine the parameters controlling TL phenomena of zircon. The input parameters of the model, such as types and concentrations of the TL centers and energy distributions of the hole and electron traps, were obtained by analyzing the experimental data on fading of the TL-emission spectra of samples from different locations. EPR data were used to establish the nature of the TL centers. Glow curves and 3 D TL emission spectra are simulated and compared with the experimental data on time-dependent TL fading. Theoretical dating curves for combined natural plus laboratory irradiation have been calculated for as-irradiated, faded and preheated samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
