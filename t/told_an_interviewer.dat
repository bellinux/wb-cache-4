5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E

Lander <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> in 2006 that they created the characters while high on marijuana. After graduating, they continued to perform the characters in live comedy routines before joining the show's cast.|$|E
25|$|The TV special, {{with the}} teleplay by Romeo Muller, {{introduced}} several new characters {{inspired by the}} song's lyrics.

He <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> in January 2017 that he was {{writing a book about}} the band, but had no plans to record or tour with Whiskeytown. A scheduling conflict was blamed as the reason for the reunion not taking place. The band did reunite for a one-off, impromptu gig after one of Adams' shows in Raleigh, NC, in 2005. Gilmore, Cary, and Adams were joined on-stage by Adams' pedal steel player, Jon Graboff, and bassist Catherine Popper.|$|E

25|$|At Brown's urging, NATO members pledged in 1977 to {{increase}} their individual defense spending three percent per year in real terms for the 1979-86 period. The objective, Brown explained, was to ensure that alliance resources and capabilities-both conventional and nuclear-would balance those of the Soviet bloc. Although some NATO members hesitated to confirm the agreement to accept new missiles and did not always attain the three percent target, Brown was pleased with NATO's progress. Midway in his term he <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> that he thought his most important achievement thus far had been the revitalization of NATO.|$|E

Harry Joseph Letterman survived a heart attack at age 36, when David was a young boy. The fear of losing his father was constantly with Letterman as he grew up. The elder Letterman died of a second heart attack at age 57.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1911, the McNamara {{brothers}} {{changed their}} pleas {{in open court}} to guilty. James B. McNamara admitted to murder by having set the bomb that destroyed the Los Angeles Times building on October 1, 1910. John J. McNamara, setting foot {{for the first time}} in court, admitted to having ordered the bombing of the Llewellyn Iron Works on December 25. J.J. McNamara later <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> that Darrow had kept the McNamara brothers isolated from public opinion.

5000|$|<b>As</b> he <b>told</b> <b>a</b> 1962 <b>interviewer,</b> [...] "It's {{what happens}} between these panels that's so fascinating. Look {{at all that}} {{dramatic}} action that one never {{gets a chance to}} see. It's between these panels that the fascinating stuff takes place. And unless the artist would be permitted to delve into that, the form must remain infantile." ...|$|R

"I'm {{very good}} with writing {{dialogue}} and characters and Gilbert {{is very good}} with creating {{the structure of a}} story, which is the hardest part for me," [...] Wilder <b>told</b> <b>an</b> A&E <b>interviewer.</b> Setting the story in Stamford, Connecticut, came naturally; Wilder and his wife made their home there in an 18th-century house left to him by his late wife Gilda Radner.|$|R
25|$|Her mother's {{career as}} a {{successful}} businesswoman and her dedication to community service in the Methodist church and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union had a powerful influence on Muriel. Anna Ball had a boarding house, {{a block from the}} train station. She fed hungry men and gave shelter to homeless young women who came to Magog on the trains and raised funds to establish a home for the elderly and started a community lending library. Duckworth was also an admirer of Nellie McClung and Agnes Macphail, two political activists who championed women's rights. Many decades later, Muriel <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> that her mother's example helped lead her into social activism. Her mother cared passionately about what she did, Muriel said. She believed she could have a positive effect and did.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, the Bundestag {{passed a}} Misdemeanors Bill dealing with traffic misdemeanors, into which a {{high-ranking}} civil servant named Dr. Eduard Dreher {{who had been}} drafting the bill inserted a prefatory section to the bill under a very misleading heading that declared that henceforth there was a statute of limitations of 15 years {{from the time of}} the offense for the crime of being an accomplices to murder which was to apply retroactively, which made it impossible to prosecute war criminals even for being accomplices to murder since the statute of limitations as now defined for the last of the suspects had expired by 1960. The Bundestag passed the Misdemeanors Bill without bothering to read the bill in its entirety so its members missed Dreher's amendment. It was estimated in 1969 that thanks to Dreher's amendment to the Misdemeanors Bill that 90% of all Nazi war criminals now enjoyed total immunity from prosecution. The prosecutor Adalbert RÃ¼ckerl who headed the Central Bureau for the Prosecution of National Socialist Crimes <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> in 1969 that this amendment had done immense harm to the ability of the Bureau to prosecute those suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|The Cannes Film Festival in 2006 saw Binoche {{feature in}} the {{anthology}} film Paris, je t'aime appearing in a section directed by the Japanese director Nobuhiro Suwa. Suwa's Place des Victoires {{is the story of}} a grief-stricken mother who manages to have a final brief moment with her dead son. The segment also features Willem Dafoe and Hippolyte Girardot. Paris, je t'aime was a popular success, taking over $17million, at the world box-office. In September 2006, Binoche appeared at the Venice Film Festival to launch A Few Days in September, written and directed by Santiago Amigorena. Despite an impressive cast including John Turturro, Nick Nolte and up-coming French star Sara Forestier, the film was a failure. A Few Days in September is a thriller set between 5 and 11 September 2001, in which Binoche plays a French secret service agent, who may, or may not, have information relating to impending attacks on the U.S. The film was the recipient of harsh criticism from the press for its perceived trivialization of the events of 11 September 2001. While promoting the film in the UK, Binoche <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> she believed the CIA and other government agencies must have had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks, as depicted in the film.|$|E

Hong Kong {{was just an}} âoutpost of colonialism,â Murphey recalled, and nothing like the huge metropolis that it became in post-war history. Murphy <b>told</b> <b>a</b> later <b>interviewer</b> his wartime encounters with Zhou Enlai, who was a âcharmerâ : ...|$|R

Not wanting to wake Valerie, Eddie grabbed a {{cassette}} recorder and recorded himself playing guitar in the closet.|$|E
500|$|Gordimer uses {{quotation}} dashes to punctuate her {{dialogue in}} Burger's Daughter instead of traditional quotation marks. She <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> in 1980 that readers {{have complained that}} this sometimes {{makes it difficult to}} identify the speaker, but she added [...] "I don't care.

Esmond George, critic at Adelaide newspaper The Mail, admired the (unidentified) work as having [...] "strong art interest". Stokes' interest in the Prize was not so strong as to prompt her to enter again. She <b>told</b> <b>an</b> <b>interviewer</b> that [...] "abstract painting took over".|$|E
