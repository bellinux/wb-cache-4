25|$|This {{argument}} has been formulated by Paul Churchland, among others. The point is that, in instances {{of some sort}} of brain damage (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.|$|E
25|$|Between 1985 and 1986 the CIA lost every spy {{it had in}} Eastern Europe. The {{details of}} the {{investigation}} into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success, and has been widely criticized. In June 1987, Major Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, the chief of Cuban Intelligence in Czechoslovakia drove into Vienna, and walked into the American Embassy to defect. He revealed <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> Cuban spy on the CIA payroll was a double agent, pretending to work for the CIA, but secretly still being loyal to Castro. On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled Aldrich Ames out of his Jaguar. In the investigation that ensued, the CIA discovered that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents. On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected {{at the time that the}} sources were compromised, but the information was sent up the chain as genuine.|$|E

500|$|Although {{baseball}} {{is a team}} sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> pitch, {{of which there are}} often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: [...] "the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits". Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues that [...] "{{baseball is}} the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports". Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As described by Mandelbaum, ...|$|E
500|$|The Rockets' current logos and uniforms were {{introduced}} in the 2003–04 season, created by New York-based agency Alfafa Studio in association with Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. The logo is a stylized 'R' {{in the shape of}} a rocket during takeoff, surrounded by a red orbit streak that can be interpreted as the central circle of a basketball court. Said [...] "R" [...] inspired the team's new custom typeface, designed so <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> digit could be read well from a distance, whether in the arena or on television. Red once again became the dominant color, with silver and black as secondary. In 2009, the Rockets invoked the championship years with an alternate red uniform, featuring gold numbers and side stripes. The Rockets had two sleeved alternate jerseys for the 2015–16 season, an alternate silver-colored uniform whose design referenced the design of NASA's Gemini-Titan rocket, and a red and gold jersey featuring the nickname [...] "Clutch City". For the 2016–17 season, the Rockets began to wear a black alternate uniform.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, various {{philosophers}} such as Donald Davidson, Hilary Putnam, and Fodor {{tried to}} resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so-called [...] "folk psychology" [...] while adhering to a materialist {{vision of the world}} which did not violate the [...] "generality of physics". Their proposal was, first of all, to reject the then-dominant theories in philosophy of mind: behaviorism and the type identity theory. The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation, especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event/cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events/causes. The type-identity theory, on the other hand, failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state. Besides being deeply anthropocentric (why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe?), the identity-type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> human brain is different from all the others. Hence, the impossibility of referring to common mental states in different physical systems manifests itself not only between different species but also between organisms of the same species.|$|E

500|$|Swift's friend, Anderson, portrayed {{herself in}} the video. The love {{interests}} of both Swift and Anderson were cast by Swift after she received images of them via e-mail. The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a green screen. On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself. Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it [...] "prolific". On the second day, scenes {{at a high school}} were filmed; artificial rain was made. Afterward, White and a team of visual effect artists created the setting. [...] "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. And to think <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said. The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video. The direction was to make the video seem [...] "magical". Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as the door and the desks. Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive. White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.|$|E
500|$|The art {{and science}} writer Peter Forbes notes that Thayer became obsessed by the [...] "flattening effect" [...] of countershading, and that {{far from being a}} scientist, he was [...] "an artist whose idealist fervour, edged by deep insecurity, led him to regard his {{findings}} less as discovery than as revelation." [...] Describing Concealing-Coloration as a [...] "magnum opus", Forbes writes that by 1909 [...] "Thayer's prophetic intolerance was in full flood", that he was overcompensating for his need for approval of his artwork, and that he failed to see that acceptance of ideas in science does not depend on [...] "the vehemence with which they are expressed". In Forbes's view, Thayer was battling for the rights of artists over scientists, citing Thayer ("it properly belongs to the realm of pictorial art") in evidence. Apart from Thayer's [...] "bizarre" [...] flamingos, Forbes calls Thayer's opposition to Batesian mimicry [...] "extreme". For Forbes, [...] "Reading Thayer's book today is a strange experience. He sets out with the idea <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> creature is perfectly camouflaged", and then [...] "tries to bludgeon his readers" [...] into agreeing. Forbes is critical of Thayer's rejection of warning coloration, quoting Thayer's daughter Gladys as writing [...] "My father's special mission was tasting butterflies"; Thayer apparently wanted to prove that mimicry was the wrong explanation as both model and mimic tasted the same. Forbes observes that natural selection did not have to contend with human reactions to the taste of butterflies.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to find a {{relationship}} between traditional species boundaries established by taxonomy and those inferred by DNA barcoding, Hebert and co-workers sequenced DNA barcodes of 260 of the 667 bird species that breed in North America (Hebert et al. 2004a). They found <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one of the 260 species had a different COI sequence. 130 species were represented by two or more specimens; in all of these species, COI sequences were either identical or were most similar to sequences of the same species. COI variations between species averaged 7.93%, whereas variation within species averaged 0.43%. In four cases there were deep intraspecific divergences, indicating possible new species. Three out of these four polytypic species are already split into two by some taxonomists. Hebert et al.s (2004a) results reinforce these views and strengthen the case for DNA barcoding. Hebert et al. also proposed a standard sequence threshold to define new species, this threshold, the so-called [...] "barcoding gap", was defined as 10 times the mean intraspecific variation for the group under study.|$|E
2500|$|Rather {{than the}} {{traditional}} first person shooter style {{of the first two}} games, both Guerrilla and Armageddon utilize a third person style of gameplay. Guerrilla takes place in an Open world environment on the planet of Mars allowing players to free roam across the environment. Armageddon is a more linear experience, largely moving through corridors and caverns from objective to objective. [...] In the games, all environments are fully destructible which means <b>that</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> building in the game can be destroyed. Players are usually equipped with four weapons, the primary weapon is a Sledgehammer with three more weapons of the player's choice. These weapons are mainly purchased using salvage, the main currency of the game, {{with the exception of the}} remote charges and assault rifle, both of which are given to the player by default at the start of the game. Purchasable weapons include an Arc Rifle, Grinder, Rocket Launcher, Proximity Mines and a Nano Rifle. Players go around completing missions for the Red Faction and perform guerrilla actions to liberate various sectors of Mars from the control of the Earth Defense Force.|$|E
