You've got to let him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have a record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm so sick of that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E
500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would love to hear them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that anyone knew about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know about that? It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E
500|$|Due to his resounding loss to Nixon in the 1972 {{election}} and the causes behind it, [...] "McGovernism" [...] became a label that a generation of Democratic politicians tried to avoid. In 1992, nationally syndicated Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene wrote, [...] "Once again politicians – mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too – are using his name as a synonym for presidential campaigns that are laughable and {{out of touch with}} the American people." [...] Conservatives used McGovern's name as a ready synonym for what they saw as liberal failures. Indeed, according to Daniel McCarthy of The American Conservative, the Republican Party began to act after 1972 as if [...] "every Democratic leader, no matter how Southern, how pro-war, how middle-of-the-road, is really a McGovernite. Indeed, for nearly 40 years the conservative movement has defined itself in opposition to the Democratic standard-bearer of 1972. Anti-McGovernism has come to play for the Right the unifying role that anticommunism once played, much to the detriment of older principles such as limited government, fiscal continence, and prudence in foreign policy." [...] The association with dovishness and weakness on defense has been especially prevalent, although McGovern publicly stated in 1972 that he was not a pacifist and that use of force was sometimes necessary, such as in World War II. McGovern later said in 2001 that his political image had been exaggerated: [...] "I am a liberal and always have been – just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be." [...] He continued to feel that he was marginalized with his views miscast. He saw himself as a son of the prairie, in 2005 reciting his traditional upbringing and family values, culminating with [...] "I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like", and in 2006 said, [...] "How <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get elected in South Dakota for twenty years if you're a wild-eyed radical?" ...|$|E
