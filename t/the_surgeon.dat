50|$|Together, Keller and Tyler earn $42,000 in two weeks, just falling eight grand {{short of}} the surgeons' demands.

During the match, Keller struggles until Mandy shows up with Keller's father.

5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided {{to limit the number}} of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, although he did not consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season.

He was the third son of <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> Gustav Phleps and Sophie (née Stolz), the daughter of a peasant. Both families had lived in Siebenbürgen for centuries. After finishing at the Lutheran Realschule school in Hermannstadt, Phleps entered the Imperial and Royal cadet school in Pressburg (in modern-day Slovakia) in 1900, and on 1 November 1901 was commissioned as a Leutnant (lieutenant) in the 3rd Regiment of the Tiroler Kaiserjäger (mountain infantry).|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the factors perceived by surgeons that promote surgery as an attractive or unattractive career choice for today’s graduates. In addition, it examined whether <b>the</b> perspectives of <b>surgeons</b> in different professional situations converges. The content of work, contextual work conditions, and calling to this job are discussed in the context of choosing surgery as a career. Methods: Eight hundred sixty-nine surgeons were asked to answer open-ended questions regarding the factors that promote surgery as an attractive or unattractive career choice for today’s graduates. Four hundred ninety-two surgeons participated, and 1, 525 statements were analyzed using Mayring’s content-analyses method. Chi-square tests were used to analyze the differences among hierarchical positions. Results: With respect to the factors that promote surgery as a profession, 40. 8 % (209 / 492) of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> stated that surgery is a calling, 29. 1 % (149 / 492) of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> provided at least one argument related to the positive task characteristics, and 12. 9 % (66 / 492) of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> provided statements related to the positive contextual factors. With respect to the factors that discourage surgery as a profession, 45. 7 % (234 / 492) of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> provided at least one argument related to the discouraging work characteristics, and 67. 6 % (346 / 492) of <b>the</b> <b>surgeons</b> provided problematic contextual characteristics...|$|R

5|$|The Federal Security Administrator was {{required}} by law to appoint an advisory committee for federal nurse training programs. The committee, which was appointed for the Nurse Training Act, consisted of people in nursing and related fields drawn from various parts of the country. Once in place, the committee met with designated federal officials and formulated the regulations necessary to carry out the act. The agreed-upon rules were then approved by <b>the</b> <b>Surgeon</b> General and published in the Federal Register. The committee was also responsible for naming the new program. The Victory Nurse Corps and the Student War Nursing Reserve were considered, but both were rejected in favor of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps.|$|E
5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges.

5|$|Traditional herbal {{medicine}} of India, known as Ayurveda, possibly {{dates back to}} the second millennium BCE tracing its origins to the holy Hindu Vedas and, in particular, the Atharvaveda. One authentic compilation of teachings is by <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> Sushruta, available in a treatise called Sushruta Samhita. This contains 184 chapters and description of 1120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources. Other early works of Ayurveda include the Charaka Samhita, attributed to Charaka. This tradition, however is mostly oral. The earliest surviving written material which contains the works of Sushruta is the Bower Manuscript—dated to the 4th century CE.|$|E
40|$|While {{some degree}} of {{specialization}} is essential in surgery there remains a place for <b>the</b> general <b>surgeon.</b> <b>The</b> tendency to regard surgical intensive care as a specialty should be resisted.

5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps <b>the</b> <b>surgeon</b> identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, deep inside the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. <b>The</b> <b>surgeon,</b> Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed deep inside the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
