40|$|The Mobile Integrated Temporary Utility System (MITUS) {{integrates}} portable {{electrical power}} along with communications and emergency alarm and lighting capabilities to provide safe, centralized power to work areas {{that need to}} be de-energized for decommissioning work. MITUS consists of a portable unit substation; up to twenty portable kiosks that house <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>receptacles,</b> communications, and emergency alarm and lighting systems; and a central communications unit. This system makes sequential decommissioning efforts efficient and cost-effective by allowing the integrated system to remain intact while being moved to subsequent work sites. Use of the MITUS also eliminates the need to conduct zero-energy tests and implement associated lock-out/tag-out procedures at partially de-energized facilities. Since the MITUS is a designed system, it can be customized to accommodate unique facility conditions simply by varying kiosks and transformer configurations. The MITUS is an attractive alternate to the use of portable generators with stand-alone communications and emergency system. It is more cost-effective than upgrading or reconfiguring existing power distribution systems...|$|R

Assigning <b>the</b> one or more power reserves may further comprise determining if, for a particular instance in time, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met by the assigned one or more power reserves, assigning a next power reserve to deliver <b>power</b> to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is not met, <b>the</b> next <b>power</b> reserve determined from the order of the indexing values associated with <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves and adjusting a power to be delivered to <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network by a most recently allocated reserve of the one or more power reserves that have been assigned to provide power at that instant in time to a level of power sufficient to meet <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement at that instant in time if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> to be delivered by the most recently allocated reserve may be adjusted by subtracting the difference between <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement at that instant in time and a summation of a power to be delivered at that instant in time by each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves assigned to deliver power at that instant in time from <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to be delivered at that instant in time by the most recently allocated reserve assigned to deliver power at that instant in time. Assigning the one or more power reserves may further comprise determining if the one or more assigned <b>power</b> reserves provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement, continuing assigning the reserves if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is not met and stopping the assigning the reserves if <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserve requirement is met.

Throughout this disclosure it will be understood that each indexing value assigned to a power reserve may correspond to a financial cost associated with that reserve. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for allocating power reserves in a <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method then comprises assigning power reserves associated with the network for meeting <b>the</b> determined <b>power</b> reserve requirement, <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves assigned according to a power response characteristic associated with each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> reserves. According to a further aspect of the invention a method for allocating power resources provided by a plurality of power reserves in a power network to meet a power reserve requirement of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> network is provided. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of power reserves, information indicative of power response characteristics associated with power resources provided by <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves. <b>The</b> method also comprises obtaining, for <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves, information indicative of an indexing value associated with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> resources provided by <b>the</b> respective <b>power</b> reserves. In addition, the method comprises determining a power reserve requirement associated with a <b>power</b> network. <b>The</b> method also comprises assigning one or more power resources provided by <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>power</b> response characteristics and the indexing value associated with each power resource provided by <b>the</b> plurality of <b>power</b> reserves to provide <b>the</b> <b>power</b> resource requirement. <b>The</b> <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a deliverable power response of a <b>power</b> reserve. Also <b>the</b> <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a mapping of <b>the</b> highest <b>power</b> and longest duration positive and negative power response with respect to time associated with a power reserve. Such a system of mapping of power reserve supply and reserve requirement allows for simple description of any flexible resource, intermittent source or frequency service regardless of their particular dynamic response. Once the method is complete, the reserve requirement may be fully accounted for by the cumulative supply provided by the least expensive available reserves. The method may be applicable to forecasted worst-case intermittency, or can be applied to state of the art frequency control services such that reserves are allocated to individual FCR, FRR or RR services. The cumulative supply can be decomposed to determine and share cost of intermittency. The method may provide intuitive visual reserve adequacy assessment and user input allocation via a user interface. The methods described herein allow for available resources to be used to their fullest which can bring down the price of reserves and may lead to a significant cost reduction for the various system operators by enlarging the pool of available reserves. A system for defining resources irrespective of type is disclosed. Consequently, a single definition system is provided to identify <b>the</b> <b>power</b> characteristics of flexible resources, intermittent resources, or frequency services regardless of their particular dynamic response.
