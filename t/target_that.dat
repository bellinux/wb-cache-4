5|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{has been}} a leader in laser-driven {{inertial}} confinement fusion (ICF) since the initial concept was developed by LLNL employee John Nuckols in the late 1950s. The basic idea was to use a driver to compress a small pellet known as the <b>target</b> <b>that</b> contains the fusion fuel, a mix of deuterium (D) and tritium (T). If the compression reaches high enough values, fusion reactions begin to take place, releasing alpha particles and neutrons. The alphas may impact atoms in the surrounding fuel, heating them {{to the point where they}} undergo fusion as well. If the rate of alpha heating is higher than heat losses to the environment, the result is a self-sustaining chain reaction known as ignition.|$|E
5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its <b>target</b> <b>that</b> day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E

5|$|In mid-July, the Battle of the Ruhr {{was coming}} to an end and Bomber Command refocused its efforts on the port city of Hamburg in {{northern}} Germany. The codename for the attack was Operation Gomorrah; the objective was the destruction of Hamburg. The operations began on 24 July 1943 and during four major night-attacks by the RAF and two minor day-attacks by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) between 40,000 and 50,000 civilians were killed. To counter the mounting success of the German night fighter force, which was directly attributed to the introduction of the Lichtenstein radar, the RAF introduced Window (Chaff or Düppel to the Germans). Window was a radar countermeasure in which aircraft spread a cloud of small, thin pieces of aluminium which effectively made it impossible for the German radar operator to identify the genuine target. Saturation of the Himmelbett control areas by a bomber stream and the introduction of Window practically made the previous Himmelbett procedure obsolete. This was also evident to the German high command. To counter these British measures two new strategies were pursued, Wilde Sau (Wild Boar) and Zahme Sau (Tame Boar). Wilde Sau, conceived by Hans-Joachim Herrmann, was a technique by which the RAF bombers were mainly engaged by single-seat fighter planes, illuminated by searchlights, over the target area. The Zahme Sau procedure, proposed by Viktor von Loßberg, called for a night fighter to infiltrate the bomber stream. The position, altitude, and general direction was then broadcast. The information was received by other night fighters, who navigated to the bomber stream by themselves. In Zahme Sau, the German night fighters were tracked and radio-controlled by means of Y-Verfahren (Y-Control). Schnaufer did not make any claims during Operation Gomorrah. Their next success came when he and Freymann shot down a Lancaster on 10/11 August 1943 at 00:32. The <b>target</b> <b>that</b> night was Nuremberg and it was the first aerial victory of the entire German night fighter force achieved by Y-Control. This was also the last victory with Freymann and his last as a member of II. Gruppe.|$|E

40|$|In {{various studies}} {{subjects}} {{have been shown}} to misperceive the positions of <b>targets</b> <b>that</b> are flashed during pursuit eye movements.

We examined whether this is because there is a fundamental difference between the information that determines our perceptual judgements of a target's position and the information that is used to guide our hand to a similar target. Subjects were asked to quickly tap <b>targets</b> <b>that</b> were flashed during pursuit with their index finger. They systematically tapped ahead of the position of the flash, in accordance with the above-mentioned perceptual mislocalisations. Thus the lack of systematic errors in Hansen's study is not a general property of fast motor responses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{extent of}} {{perceived}} motion smear was compared for <b>targets</b> <b>that</b> underwent similar velocities of retinal image motion during the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in the dark, the visually enhanced VOR (VVOR), VOR suppression, and fixation. Compared {{to the extent}} of perceived motion smear during fixation, observers reported significantly less smear when the target moved either in the same direction or against the direction of the head movement during the VVOR and VOR. We also confirmed a previous finding that perceived smear is attenuated asymmetrically during VOR suppression, with attenuation occurring primarily for <b>targets</b> <b>that</b> move against the direction of the observer’s head motion. The results support the hypothesis that the visual system employs extra-retinal signals that accompany eye and head movements to reduce the perception of motion smear for <b>targets</b> <b>that</b> move physically in the opposite direction of eye and/or head movements...|$|R
