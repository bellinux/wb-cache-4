5|$|Hearing <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> {{has been}} lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> appears {{in front of the window}} and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> that killed {{him is the}} first shark's mother, and that {{it must also be}} inside the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> herself shows up at the window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|Quint, Brody, and Hooper {{set out on}} Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> While Brody {{lays down}} a chum line, Quint waits for an {{opportunity}} to hook <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint examines <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> and harpoons a barrel into it, but it drags the barrel underwater and disappears.|$|E

50|$|After a {{promising}} {{first season with}} <b>the</b> <b>Sharks,</b> McLeod re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> for <b>the</b> 2011 season in August 2010. He went on to play for <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> in 2012 and 2013 as well, winning an NBL championship in the process.|$|R
5|$|The next day, Kay and Michael Brody are {{informed}} of Overman's disappearance. They {{go down in}} a submarine to look for his body, and during the search, they encounter a smaller shark. The dolphins rescue Kay and Mike, but <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> escapes back into the park. The news of <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> is disbelieved by Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, though it excites his hunter friend, Phillip FitzRoyce, who states his intention to kill <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> on network television. Kay protests and suggests capturing and keeping <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> alive in captivity, to guarantee more publicity for the park. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> is successfully captured and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> dies.|$|E
5|$|Thea goes on an {{inflatable}} banana boat {{with her friend}} Margaret and her mother, while Carla presents her new art sculpture. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> goes for Thea but attacks and kills Margaret's mother instead. Ellen boards Jake's boat to track down <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> intending to kill it to save {{the rest of her}} family. After hearing about what happened, Mike confesses about <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> infuriating Carla. Mike and Jake are flown by Hoagie to search for Ellen, and they find <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> in pursuit of their boat. During the search, Hoagie explains to Mike about Ellen's belief that <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> that killed Sean is after her family. When they finally find her, Hoagie lands the plane on the water, ordering Mike and Jake to swim to the boat as <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> drags the plane and Hoagie underwater.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E
50|$|Requiem {{sharks are}} <b>sharks</b> of <b>the</b> family Carcharhinidae {{in the order}} Carcharhiniformes, {{containing}} migratory, live-bearing sharks of warm seas (sometimes of brackish or fresh water) such as <b>the</b> spinner <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacknose <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacktip <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacktail reef <b>shark,</b> and <b>the</b> blacktip reef <b>shark.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> {{regular season}} leading the Western Conference with 113 points {{and being the}} second team in the League after the Washington Capitals.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> {{team that}} {{plays in the}} Super Rugby {{competition}} {{is essentially the same}} team - they also play in Durban and draw their players from the KwaZulu-Natal area. For most of Super Rugby history, <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> Super Rugby franchise drew players from a much larger area than <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> provincial union, with the rugby unions of Border, based in East London and Eastern Province from Port Elizabeth included in <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> franchise. Since 2013 the Southern Kings functions on its own, and no more supplies players to <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> franchise.|$|R
5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, {{repairing}} the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> drags the boat backwards, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 the {{aquarium}} began to feature six gill <b>sharks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sharks</b> {{were taken from}} the Puget Sound at 500 feet deep, and were hooked with a long line. The line was tied to a buoy and dressed with ham, raw beef, and lingcod. After <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> were captured, they lost their appetite and motivation. Griffin entered the tank in a wetsuit to force-feed <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> mackerel and to push them around. <b>The</b> <b>sharks</b> did not last long, but the presence of <b>the</b> <b>sharks</b> significantly increased aquarium attendance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> 2017 {{season with}} a 31-24 record and finished in 3rd place in the East and won the East Division in the 2nd half of the season.

5|$|Fortunately, Hoagie {{escapes from}} <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> Jake and Mike hastily put {{together}} an explosive powered by electrical impulses. They begin blasting <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with the impulses, which begin to drive it mad; it repeatedly {{jumps out of the}} water, roaring in pain. As Jake moves {{to the front of the}} boat, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> lunges, giving it the chance to pull Jake under and maul him. He manages to get the explosive into the shark's mouth before he is taken underwater.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> then causes the boat to break apart with its death contortions, forcing the people on the boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped <b>the</b> smoothtooth blacktip <b>shark</b> with <b>the</b> spinner <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), <b>the</b> blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. limbatus), <b>the</b> graceful <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchoides), and <b>the</b> finetooth <b>shark</b> (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore {{and colleagues}} reported in 2011 that this species {{is closely related}} to <b>the</b> graceful <b>shark,</b> <b>the</b> blacktip <b>shark,</b> and <b>the</b> Australian blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. tilstoni).|$|R
50|$|On top of {{the normal}} {{expansion}} process, <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> participated in a draft to select players from the North Stars. <b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> and Stars then participated in an expansion draft.

50|$|The series {{started in}} San Jose. <b>The</b> <b>Sharks</b> were victorious in Game 1 by {{a score of}} 2-1. However, in Game 2, the Coyotes rebounded and won 3-1. Games 3 and 4 went to Phoenix. In Game 3, <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> won 4-1, while in Game 4, <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> won 2-1. Game 5 shifted back to San Jose, where <b>the</b> <b>Sharks</b> would win <b>the</b> game 4-1 and win the series 4-1.|$|R
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> {{attacks the}} other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
5|$|Mike {{continues}} to blast <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> with the impulses, {{causing it to}} leap {{out of the water}} again, igniting the bomb as Ellen steers the sailboat towards <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> while thinking back to Sean's demise, the shark's attack on Thea, and when her husband killed the first shark. The broken bowsprit impales <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> in the exact spot where the bomb is, causing it to explode on impact. The shark's corpse then sinks {{to the bottom of the}} sea. Mike then hears Jake calling for help, seriously injured, but alive and conscious, floating in the water. The four survive the harsh encounter and make it back to land. Hoagie then flies Ellen back to Amity Island.|$|E

5|$|On the boat, Susan dives {{underwater}} and {{encounters a}} tiger shark. Taking shelter behind a reef, she is attacked by an underwater zombie. She escapes as <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> and the zombie attack each other. Brian shoots at <b>the</b> <b>shark,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> rams the boat, damaging it. Eventually, the group arrives at Matul, firing distress flares to request assistance. Menard goes to meet them, leaving his nurse (Stefania D'Amario) {{to supervise the}} mass burial of dead patients. He tells Anne that her father is dead‚Äîa victim of the troubles on the island‚Äîand asks the group to check on Paola. They are horrified to discover her corpse being devoured by zombies.|$|E
5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. <b>The</b> <b>shark</b> circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, <b>the</b> <b>shark</b> often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Brody's {{teenage son}} Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing {{with his friends}} after his love interest, Jackie Peters, goads him to, but his younger brother, Sean, catches him, and persuades Mike to bring him along. After an {{argument}} at the dock, Marge, one of Mike's friends, playfully lets Sean come in her boat with her, and {{after a couple of}} other grouping arrangements, they head out, going past a team of divers, led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after going underwater, Andrews encounters <b>the</b> <b>shark.</b> Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism.
