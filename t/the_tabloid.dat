Coogan has also {{been critical of the}} broadsheet press, saying they have colluded with <b>the</b> <b>tabloids</b> in <b>the</b> interests of selling newspapers. In 2005 he said [...] "The Guardian tends to have its cake and eat it.

50|$|The {{government}} will occasionally crack down in <b>the</b> <b>tabloids</b> by closing them and changing their staff, but the commercial pressures on <b>the</b> <b>tabloids</b> to gather readers {{and the fact}} that many enjoy considerable political protection makes the effectiveness of these actions limited.|$|R

5|$|Aesthetically glam metal draws {{heavily on}} the glam rock or glitter rock of the 1970s, often with very long backcombed hair, use of make-up, gaudy {{clothing}} and accessories (chiefly consisting of tight denim or leather jeans, spandex, and headbands). The visual aspects of glam metal appealed to music television producers, particularly MTV, whose establishment coincided {{with the rise of}} the genre. Glam metal performers became infamous for their debauched lifestyles of drugs, strippers and late-night parties, which were widely covered in <b>the</b> <b>tabloid</b> press.|$|E
5|$|He {{missed the}} entire 1991–92 season while he recovered, {{suffering}} a further knee injury in late 1991, when an incident at a nightclub on Tyneside {{kept him out}} for even longer. The saga over Gascoigne's proposed transfer to Lazio dominated <b>the</b> <b>tabloid</b> press throughout 1991, often overshadowing the key national news of that time – namely the recession and rise in unemployment that it sparked – although the broadsheet newspapers generally kept stories about Gascoigne confined to their back pages.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} attracted sustained {{international interest}} and saturation {{coverage in the}} UK reminiscent {{of the death of}} Diana in 1997.

In 2008 they received damages and front-page apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 they testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in America, Hergé had been keen to produce a mystery story, and had been inspired by <b>the</b> <b>tabloid</b> speculation surrounding an alleged Curse of the Pharaohs following the 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Cigars of the Pharaoh proved a commercial success in Belgium, and Hergé followed it with The Blue Lotus, a story which continues many of the plot elements that began in Cigars. The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1955, Cigars of the Pharaoh was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's distinctive ligne-claire style by the cartoonist and his Studios Hergé team; during this process a number of minor plot elements were changed. The comic was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. Critical reception of the story has been positive, with analysis being focused on its innovative narrative and stylistic choices, {{as well as its}} introduction of three recurring characters, the detectives Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos, who in this album appears to be a friendly, but in the continuing album The Blue Lotus is revealed as a villain.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly.

Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly with the security cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain.

The first chapter was released for purchase {{in the summer of}} 2008 on digital video stores, such as iTunes Store and Amazon Video on Demand. DC Direct released action figures based on the film in January 2009. Director Zack Snyder also set up a YouTube contest petitioning Watchmen fans to create faux commercials of products made by the fictional Veidt Enterprises. The producers also released two short video pieces online, which were intended to be viral videos designed as fictional backstory pieces, with one being a 1970 newscast marking the 10th anniversary of the public appearance of Dr. Manhattan. The other was a short propaganda film promoting the Keene Act of 1977, which made it illegal to be a superhero without government support. An official viral marketing web site, The New Frontiersman, is named after <b>the</b> <b>tabloid</b> magazine featured in the graphic novel, and contains teasers styled as declassified documents. After the trailer to the film premiered in July 2008, DC Comics president Paul Levitz said that the company had had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchmen trade collection to meet the additional demand for the book that the advertising campaign had generated, with the total annual print run expected to be over one million copies. DC Comics reissued Watchmen #1 for the original cover price of $1.50 on December 10, 2008; no other issues are to be reprinted.|$|E

Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is intersex, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, is his split personality.
