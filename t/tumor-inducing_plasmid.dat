40|$|Most plant viruses are {{transmitted}} by insect vectors. We present an alternative method for {{the introduction of}} infectious viral DNA that uses the ability of Agrobacterium to transfer DNA from bacterial cells to plants. Cauliflower mosaic virus was chosen to develop this method {{because it is the}} best characterized plant DNA virus and can be introduced into plants via aphids, virus particles, viral DNA, or suitably treated cloned DNA. We show that systemic infection of turnips results from wounding and inoculation with strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens in which more than one genome of cauliflower mosaic virus have been placed tandemly in the T-DNA of the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid.</b> Thus such constructions allow escape of the viral genome from the T-DNA once inside the plants. The combined use of the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> and viral DNA opens the way to molecular biological approaches that are not possible with either system alone...|$|E

40|$|Several loci on the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> from Agrobacterium tumefaciens were transcriptionally {{activated}} in {{the presence}} of wounded plant tissue or extracts. The inducible virulence loci were required for efficient tumor formation. In contrast, the plant-inducible locus pinF was not observed to be absolutely essential for virulence. Mutants in pinF showed an attenuated virulence on a variety of dicotyledonous hosts, and this attenuation became more pronounced with decreasing numbers of bacterial cells in the inoculum. The DNA sequence of a 5. 5 -kilobase region which included the pinF locus from the octopine-type <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> A 6 was determined. Four open reading frames consistent with the observed transcription of pinF were observed. Two of the open reading frames, pinF 1 and pinF 2, coded for polypeptides with relative molecular weights of 47, 519 (pinF 1) and 46, 740 (pinF 2). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of pinF 1 and pinF 2 indicated that they were similar {{to each other and to}} known polypeptide sequences for cytochrome P- 450 enzymes...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel plant transformation technique, termed “agrolistic,” that combines {{the advantages of}} the Agrobacterium transformation system with the high efficiency of biolistic DNA delivery. Agrolistic transformation allows integration of the gene of interest without undesired vector sequence. The virulence genes virD 1 and virD 2 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens that are required in bacteria for excision of T-strands from the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> were placed {{under the control of the}} CaMV 35 S promoter and codelivered with a target plasmid containing border sequences flanking the gene of interest. Transient expression assays in tobacco and in maize cells indicated that vir gene products caused strand-specific nicking in planta at the right border sequence, similar to VirD 1 /VirD 2 -catalyzed T-strand excision observed in Agrobacterium. Agrolistically transformed tobacco calli were obtained after codelivery of virD 1 and virD 2 genes together with a selectable marker flanked by border sequences. Some inserts exhibited right junctions with plant DNA that corresponded precisely to the sequence expected for T-DNA (portion of the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> that is transferred to plant cells) insertion events. We designate these as “agrolistic” inserts, as distinguished from “biolistic” inserts. Both types of inserts were found in some transformed lines. The frequency of agrolistic inserts was 20 % that of biolistic inserts...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco calli were {{transformed}} at levels up to 50 % by cocultivation of tobacco cultured cells with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the binary transfer-DNA vector, pGA 472, containing a kanamycin resistance marker. Transformation frequency {{was dependent on}} the physiological state of the tobacco cells, the nature of Agrobacterium strain and, less so, on {{the expression of the}} vir genes of the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid.</b> Maximum transformation frequency was obtained with exponentially growing plant cells, suggesting that rapid growth of plant cells is an essental factor for efficient transformation of higher plants...|$|E
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil {{phytopathogen}} that elicits neoplastic growths on {{the host}} plant species. In nature, however, Agrobacterium also may encounter organisms belonging to other kingdoms such as insects and animals that {{feed on the}} infected plants. Can Agrobacterium, then, also infect animal cells? Here, we report that Agrobacterium attaches to and genetically transforms several types of human cells. In stably transformed HeLa cells, the integration event occurred at the right border of the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid's</b> transferred-DNA (T-DNA), suggesting bona fide T-DNA transfer and lending support {{to the notion that}} Agrobacterium transforms human cells by a mechanism similar to that which it uses for transformation of plants cells. Collectively, our results suggest that Agrobacterium can transport its T-DNA to human cells and integrate it into their genome...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of cytokinins by plant-associated bacteria was examined by radioimmunoassay. Strains producing trans-zeatin {{were identified in}} the genera Agrobacterium and Pseudomonas. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains containing nopaline <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmids,</b> A. tumefaciens Lippia isolates, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains produced trans-zeatin in culture at 0. 5 to 44 micrograms/liter. Pseudomonas solanacearum and Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi produced trans-zeatin at levels of up to 1 mg/liter. In vitro cytokinin biosynthetic activity was measured for representative strains and was found to correlate with trans-zeatin production. The genetic locus for trans-zeatin secretion (tzs) was cloned from four strains: A. tumefaciens T 37, A. rhizogenes A 4, P. solanacearum K 60, and P. syringae pv. savastanoi 1006. Southern blot analysis showed substantial homology of the Agrobacterium tzs genes to each other {{but not to the}} two Pseudomonas genes...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium Ti (<b>tumor-inducing)</b> <b>plasmids,</b> the causative {{agents of}} crown gall disease, fall into four genetic {{groups based on}} the {{patterns}} of octopine and nopaline synthesis (by crown gall tumors) and catabolism (by Agrobacterium tumefaciens) {{for which they are}} responsible. Two classes of Ti plasmids induce tumors that synthesize neither octopine nor nopaline. The existence of these Ti plasmids challenged the view that opines such as octopine and nopaline {{play a central role in}} crown gall biology. We now report the occurrence of an opine in tumors induced by one of these classes of Ti plasmids, the “null-type” plasmids typified by pTi Bo 542. The opine was purified by biological enrichment based on its utilization by bacteria containing pTi Bo 542 but not by bacteria lacking a Ti plasmid. The mass spectrum and biological properties of this opine are identical to those of agropine, an opine recently discovered in octopine-type tumors. We propose that null-type Ti plasmids now be named for their signal opine, agropine-type Ti plasmids...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens induces crown gall tumors by {{transferring}} a {{piece of}} its <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> into plant cells. This transferred DNA encodes the synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin, and their overproduction results in tumor formation. The transfer is initiated by a two-component regulatory system, VirA/G recognizing plant signal molecules in the plant rhizosphere and activating a regulon on the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid,</b> which {{is required for the}} processing and transfer of DNA and protein. Although a great deal is known about vir gene activation, nothing is known about whether or how the vir gene regulon is inactivated after plant cell transformation. Presumably, just as a mechanism exists for activating the vir gene regulon only when a plant is in the immediate environment, a mechanism should exist for inactivating the same regulon once it has fulfilled its mission to transferred DNA into plant cells. We now show that IAA inactivates vir gene expression by competing with the inducing phenolic compound acetosyringone for interaction with VirA. IAA does not inhibit the vir genes in cells containing a constitutive sensor virA locus, which does not require any signal molecules to become phosphorylated. At higher concentrations, IAA inhibits the growth of Agrobacterium and many other plant-associated bacteria but not the growth of bacteria that occupy other ecological niches. These observations provide the missing link in the cycle of vir gene activation and inactivation...|$|E
40|$|A binary vector {{was invented}} soon {{after it had}} been elucidated that crown gall {{tumorigenesis}} was caused by genetic transformation of plant cells {{with a piece of}} DNA, T-DNA for transferred DNA, from a Ti plasmid (<b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid)</b> harbored by the soil bacte-rium Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Fraley et al., 1986). A key finding was that the virulence genes, which are involved in the transfer of T-DNA, could be placed on a replicon separate from the one with T-DNA (Hoekema et al., 1983). Thus, combination of a ‘‘dis-armed’ ’ strain, which carries a Ti plasmid without the wild-type T-DNA, and an artificial T-DNA within a plasmid that can be replicated both in Escherichia coli and A. tumefaciens turned out to be fully functional in plant transformation.

40|$|Upon {{incubation}} of Agrobacterium tumefaciens A 348 with acetosyringone, the {{vir genes}} encoded by the Ti (<b>tumor-inducing)</b> <b>plasmid</b> are induced. The addition of certain opines, including octopine, nopaline, leucinopine, and succinamopine, enhanced this induction 2 - to 10 -fold. The compounds mannopine, acetopine, arginine, pyruvate, and leucine did not stimulate the induction of the vir genes {{to such an}} extent. The enhancement of vir gene induction by opines depended on acetosyringone and the genes virA and virG. Opines stimulated {{the activity of the}} vir genes, the double-stranded cleavage of the T (transferred) -DNA at the border repeat sequences, and the production of T-strands by the bacterium. The transformation efficiency of cotton shoot tips was markedly increased by the addition of acetosyringone and nopaline at the time of infection...|$|E

40|$|The hairy-root-inducing plasmid A 4 (pRiA 4) {{is capable}} of conferring {{tumorigenic}} symptoms on plants upon infection by its host bacterium, Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The virB operon on pRiA 4 has been sequenced and found to be composed of 11 genes, virBl to virBll, whose products mostly appear {{to be associated with}} the cell membrane. A novel structural characteristic is frequent overlappings between the translation termination and initiation codons of adjacent genes. This is indicative of fine tuning of relative translation frequencies for each VirB protein. These results support the view that VirB multisubunit complexes provide facilities for T-DNA transfer at the bacterial cell membrane. The structural organization of the pRiA 4 virB operon was essentially identical to that of the previously reported virB operons of <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmids,</b> pTiC 58 and pTiA 6, and the corresponding VirB proteins of the three plasmids were extremely homologous to one another.

40|$|I have {{developed}} promoter expression binary vectors {{based on the}} <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to facilitate elucidation of plant gene regulation. Promoter activity can be determined by inserting DNA fragments into the multiple cloning sites of the vectors forming transcriptional and/or translational fusions between the cat structural gene and an inserted promoter region. The activity of the nopaline synthase (nos) promoter was demonstrated with the vector. However, three animal promoters tested with this system showed no measurable activity in plant cells. Examination of 40 independently derived transformed tissues revealed a 200 -fold difference in the nos promoter activity. Furthermore, there is no apparent correlation between the neomycin phosphotransferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities, although both genes are closely linked and under control of identical nos promoters. These results indicate that vast differences in promoter activity of transferred genes can occur within the same cell, {{as well as in}} independently derived cell lines...|$|E
40|$|To obtain {{transformation}} of plant cells, we incubated 3 -day-old cell wall-regenerating protoplasts from tobacco with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring tumor-inducing plasmids. Putative transformed tobacco cells were selected by phytohormone autotrophic growth and {{were shown to}} be transformed by the detection of the tumor cell specific enzymes lysopine dehydrogenase or nopaline dehydrogenase. This was substantiated by the detection, in transformed tumor tissues, of DNA sequences homologous to sequences in the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid.</b> Segregation of tumor markers has been observed among the transformants and {{it is suggested that}} this happened during the initiation of the transformation. The stable character of the transformed state was shown by the retention of tumor markers in subcloning of primary transformants under nonselective conditions. Suppression of the neoplastic state of transformants could take place, resulting in the development of transformed shoots.

40|$|We {{describe}} a conserved family of bacterial gene products {{that includes the}} VirB 1 virulence factor encoded by <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmids</b> of Agrobacterium spp., proteins involved in conjugative DNA transfer of broad-host-range bacterial plasmids, and gene products that {{may be involved in}} invasion by Shigella spp. and Salmonella enterica. Sequence analysis and structural modeling show that the proteins in this group are related to chicken egg white lysozyme and are likely to adopt a lysozyme-like structural fold. Based on their similarity to lysozyme, we predict that these proteins have glycosidase activity. Iterative data base searches with three conserved sequence motifs from this protein family detect a more distant relationship to bacterial and bacteriophage lytic transglycosylases, and goose egg white lysozyme. Two acidic residues in the VirB 1 protein of Agrobacterium tumefaciens form a putative catalytic dyad, Each of these residues was changed into the corresponding amide by site-directed mutagenesis. Strains of A. tumefaciens that express mutated VirB 1 proteins have a significantly reduced virulence. We hypothesize that many bacterial proteins involved in export of macromolecules belong to a widespread class of hydrolases and cleave beta- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds as part of their function...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{scientists}} have used Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation to generate transgenic plants. Initial technologies to introduce genes of interest (goi) into Agrobacterium involved complex microbial genetic methodologies that inserted these goi into the transfer DNA (T-DNA) region of large <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmids</b> (Ti-plasmids). However, scientists eventually learned that T-DNA transfer could still be effected if the T-DNA region and the virulence (vir) genes required for T-DNA processing and transfer were split into two replicons. This binary system permitted facile manipulation of Agrobacterium and opened up the field of plant genetic engineering to numerous laboratories. In this review, we recount the history of development of T-DNA binary vector systems, and we describe important components of these systems. Some of these considerations were previously described in a review by Hellens et al. (2000 b). Agrobacterium transfers T-DNA, which makes up a small (approximately 5 %– 10 %) region of a resident Ti-plasmid or root-inducing plasmid (Ri-plasmid), to numerous species of plants (DeCleene and DeLey, 1976; Anderson and Moore, 1979), although the bacterium can be manipulated in the laboratory to transfer T-DNA to fungal (Bundock et al., 1995; Piers et al. ...|$|R

40|$|Transferred DNA (T-DNA) {{transfer}} from Agrobacterium tumefaciens into eukaryotic cells {{is the only}} known example of interkingdom DNA transfer. T-DNA is a single-stranded segment of Agrobacterium's <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid</b> that enters the plant cell as a complex with the bacterial virulence proteins VirD 2 and VirE 2. The VirE 2 protein is highly induced on contact of A. tumefaciens with a plant host and {{has been reported to}} act in late steps of transfer. One of its previously demonstrated functions is binding to the single-stranded (ss) T-DNA and protecting it from degradation. Recent experiments suggest other functions of the protein. A combination of planar lipid bilayer experiments, vesicle swelling assays, and DNA transport experiments demonstrated that VirE 2 can insert itself into artificial membranes and form channels. These channels are voltage gated, anion selective, and single-stranded DNA-specific and can facilitate the efficient transport of single-stranded DNA through membranes. These experiments demonstrate a VirE 2 function as a transmembrane DNA transporter, which could have applications in gene delivery systems...|$|E

This foreign DNA segment, called T-DNA, is maintained at several copies per diploid tumor cell. We have examined subcellular DNA fractions from this tumor line in an effort to determine whether T-DNA is in chloroplasts, mitochondria, or nuclei. Tumor cell chloroplast DNA exhibited EcoRI and Bst I endonuclease cleavage patterns identical to those of normal tobacco chloroplast DNA. Tumor cell mitochondrial DNA exhibited a complex Bst I cleavage pattern that did not differ detectably from that of normal tobacco mitochondrial DNA. Southern blots of tumor chloroplast and mitochondrial cleavage products did not hybridize with labeled pTi T 37 DNA, whereas blots of tumor cell nuclear DNA cleavage products hybridized strongly.

TL-DNA is defined by several internal HindIII restriction fragments totaling 10. 8 kilobase pairs (kbp) in uncloned soybean and alfalfa tumors. Alfalfa tumor DNA may contain one more HindIII fragment at the left end of TL-DNA than does soybean tumor DNA. TR-DNA has a 5. 8 -kbp BamHI-EcoRI internal fragment. All borders other than the left border of TL-DNA appear to be the same within the detection limits of Southern blot hybridization experiments. The two T-DNA regions are separated by 16 to 19 kbp of DNA not stably maintained in tumors. The distance from the left border of TL-DNA to the right border of TR-DNA is approximately 40 kbp.

40|$|The IncP antibiotic-resistance {{plasmids}} {{transfer to}} {{a broad range of}} bacterial species. The RK 2 origin of DNA transfer (oriT) consists of a 250 -base-pair segment including the single-stranded cleavage site (nic) needed to generate the DNA strand believed to be transferred. Deletion derivatives and a bank of hydroxylamine-generated oriT mutants were screened for loss of transferability. DNA regions flanking both sides of nic are required for optimal transfer of the oriT clone. Of the chemically induced mutants, critical base-pair changes that dramatically reduced transfer frequency were found in a 10 -base-pair region adjacent to nic. Relaxation (nicking) assays performed with these point mutants using protein-DNA complexes reconstituted in vitro revealed a correlation between DNA nicking and transfer frequency. Base-pair changes within the proximal arm of an inverted repeat upstream from the nick site resulted in reduced binding of the essential transfer protein TraJ and correspondingly reduced transfer frequencies. The results support a model of relaxosome formation involving at least two essential proteins: TraI and TraJ. The nick region defined by the point mutants was located in a segment known to be nearly identical in the related plasmid R 751. This sequence was also found to be highly conserved in both border junctions of the transfer DNA (T-DNA) of plant <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmids</b> of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, indicating a relationship between IncP-mediated broad-host-range bacterial conjugation and T-DNA transfer to plants...|$|R

The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into opine-producing factories. Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy.

We show that nicks are introduced at unique, identical locations {{in each of the}} 24 -base-pair imperfect direct repeats which flank the T-DNA and present evidence that a linear, single-stranded molecule is generated.

40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens induces crown gall tumors {{on plants}} by {{transferring}} a nucleoprotein complex, the T-complex, from the bacterium {{to the plant}} cell. The T-complex consists of T-DNA, a single-stranded DNA segment of the <b>tumor-inducing</b> <b>plasmid,</b> VirD 2, an endonuclease covalently bound to the 5 ′ end of the T-DNA, and perhaps VirE 2, a single-stranded DNA binding protein. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for proteins interacting with VirD 2 and VirE 2 to identify components in Arabidopsis thaliana that interact with the T-complex. Three VirD 2 - and two VirE 2 -interacting proteins were identified. Here we characterize the interactions of VirD 2 with two isoforms of Arabidopsis cyclophilins identified by using this analysis. The VirD 2 domain interacting with the cyclophilins is distinct from the endonuclease, omega, and the nuclear localization signal domains. The VirD 2 –cyclophilin interaction is disrupted in vitro by cyclosporin A, which also inhibits Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis and tobacco.

A binary vector has been constructed to permit examination of T-DNA border function in trans to the Ti plasmid. In this situation, a single T-DNA border is necessary for early expression of T-DNA genes and is sufficient for stable integration in any orientation...|$|R
