5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} zip code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|The second {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of the renovation of the governor's mansion. Kentucky first lady Phyllis George Brown created the Save the Mansion Fund to help cover the costs of the renovation. When the renovation was complete, she planned a nine-day showcase of the mansion for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to take a tour of the mansion. Legislator Eugene P. Stuart objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion their <b>tax</b> <b>dollars</b> supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant the injunction, and Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor John Y. Brown, Jr.|$|E

5000|$|In 2014, the Philadelphia City Controller's office {{issued a}} report urging the {{consolidation}} of Visit Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau. The report found that the agencies had occasionally clashed, had competing slogans, and did not adequately coordinate efforts, and concluded that merging the two agencies could save $1 million in administrative costs annually. The report found that from 1993 to 2013, [...] "the annual number of overnight leisure travelers to Philadelphia increased by 84 percent" [...] and Visit Philadelphia was credited for about two-thirds of that increase. The report contrasted this to business travel (the responsibility of PHLCVB), which was [...] "essentially flat since 1997." [...] The report, found, however, that PHLCVB had a better return on investment ("$74 for each <b>tax</b> <b>dollar</b> spent as opposed to $69 per <b>tax</b> <b>dollar</b> spent by Visit Philadelphia") because business travelers tend {{to spend more than}} tourists.|$|R
