5000|$|The {{aspirational}} {{focus of}} this tableau vivant, while situating <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> as an object on view, [...] insists on an aesthetics of connections: between <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>and</b> beholders, between <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> sic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> art institutions, <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> <b>artist's</b> conscious <b>and</b> unconscious processes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>artist</b> draws <b>and</b> paints <b>the</b> girl, but {{gradually}} grows frustrated with her work. She notices a man (Cyril Lecomte) watching {{her and the}} girl.

Fripp's public writing of his diary has challenged his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You Go I Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E

5|$|Hahn {{recalled}} {{some difficulty}} in finding someone {{to host the}} film, so the studio decided to use a group of artists and musicians from various fields of entertainment. The interstitials were filmed in various locations; the orchestra, Jones, Lansbury, and Bronfman were shot in Los Angeles, Perlman and Middler in New York City, and others in Boston, Massachusetts. Each scene was filmed {{in front of a}} green screen to allow shots of the orchestra or the set to be placed behind them. The shots of Levine, <b>the</b> <b>artists,</b> <b>and</b> the orchestra were filmed on October 31, 1998. The piano Grierson plays in his scene with Jones is the same one on which he played Rhapsody in Blue for the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended with the late 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to <b>the</b> <b>artists,</b> <b>and</b> established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock.|$|E
5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E

25|$|As her {{collection}} grew, Cisneros saw that Latin American art was under-represented {{in the international}} art community, so the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros (CPPC) was formed in the 1990s, with a goal of bringing visibility and impact to the way Latin American art history is viewed and appreciated. That effort has included a four-pronged approach: An ambitious approach to lending artworks around the world, working with scholars and academics {{to learn more about}} <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> their works, the creation of a publications program to provide supporting information about <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> their work, and building an online forum for the artwork.|$|E

25|$|Baudelaire was {{an active}} {{participant}} in the artistic life of his times. As critic and essayist, he wrote extensively and perceptively about the luminaries and themes of French culture. He was frank with friends and enemies, rarely took the diplomatic approach and sometimes responded violently verbally, which often undermined his cause. His associations were numerous and included: Gustave Courbet, Honoré Daumier, Franz Liszt, Champfleury, Victor Hugo, Gustave Flaubert, Balzac and <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> writers that follow.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the trip}} was a huge success for <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> their label, it also marked another {{significant}} change in the political landscape at Stax. At a fraught tour meeting in Al Bell's hotel room, Steve Cropper was summarily removed as Stax's A director, and Al Bell took over the position. Following the touring party's return to Memphis, Bell was also promoted to executive vice president, and horn players Wayne Jackson and Andrew Love joined the Stax rhythm section as salaried Stax employees.|$|E

Pasargadae along with Susa and Persepolis expressed the authority of The King of Kings, the staircases of the latter recording in relief sculpture the vast extent of the imperial frontier.|$|E

These groups not only turned to Argentine folk for inspiration, they began experimenting with South American musical styles as well; their lyrics becoming increasingly poetic with concerns about nature and the human condition.|$|E

There he became friends with <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> <b>and</b> illustrators Salomon van Abbe, John Nicolson and Robert Charles Peter. It is believed that, after finishing full-time studies at Bolt Court in the summer of 1906, he continued to work at The Daily Chronicle and then perhaps at other newspapers while studying in the evenings at Bolt Court, though very little is known about this period in his life.|$|E
