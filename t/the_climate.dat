5|$|A high {{obliquity}} {{would probably}} result in {{dramatic changes in}} <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> and may destroy the planet's habitability. When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly insolation at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for periods as long as 10million years.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>climate.</b> Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, causing it to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, causing it to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences <b>the</b> <b>climate</b> on a much smaller scale than the Andes.|$|E

5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round.
