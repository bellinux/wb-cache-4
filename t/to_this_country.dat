5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lehuby's company readied a ship at Le Havre {{and began}} to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 {{obtained}} passports to travel to Poyais. Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic—he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins & Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives {{to suggest that the}} relevant bonds were issued. The Sketch was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called Some Account of the Poyais Country. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> they had never heard of, and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract I {{examine the}} {{legitimacy}} of immigration controls {{in the context of}} Canada and <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> restrictive immigration policies. Despite the fundamental, philosophical arguments against immigration restrictions, the necessity of immigration controls is rarely questioned in Canadian politics. In this paper I suggest that there is an incredible cynicism of Canadian immigration policies with respect <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> own political principles. The idea of international migration controls is neither sustainable from a larger liberaltheory perspective nor a political-economy viewpoint. I suggest that geographers should imagine alternatives to the current systems of immigration control and the regulation of the international movement of people...|$|R

25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think {{it is unfortunate that}} anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of thousands of children had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really knew what was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b>|$|E

During the late 1980s and the 1990s, she visited many developing countries in Asia and Africa for charitable works and goodwill missions, helping children who had suffered from disasters and war as well as raising international awareness of the situations of children in poor countries. Her visit to Angola in 1989 was the first recorded VIP visit from Japan <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> and marked a milestone for the diplomatic relation between Japan and Angola. Kuroyanagi {{has raised more than}} $20 million for the UNICEF programmes that she has been involved in, through television fund-raising campaigns. She also used the royalties from her bestselling book, Totto-chan, to contribute to UNICEF. Kuroyanagi also participated in the international UNICEF ‘Say Yes for Children’ campaign, other celebrities.|$|E

During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde. On one point he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in Lahore and Islamabad and {{at the request of the}} President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.|$|E
