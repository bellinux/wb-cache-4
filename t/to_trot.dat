5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses is a tendency <b>to</b> <b>trot</b> with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, {{and appears to be}} heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E

500|$|A draught-type horse {{must pass}} two {{tests in the}} {{studbook}} evaluation: a walking test and either a pulling or a general drivability test. The points given for the horse's performance in these tests are added to those given for its temperament and gaits, resulting in the final workability score. The horse is also given a score for its conformation. In addition to achieving the minimum scores for both workability and conformation, stallions accepted for the working-horse section of the stud book are required <b>to</b> <b>trot</b> [...] in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds.|$|E

500|$|The Last Dog on Earth has {{received}} mixed reception from critics, who have praised the plot, but criticized the heavy use of coincidences {{to advance the}} plot.

Within the Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, Volume 47, Rachel Seftel reviewed the novel. She felt that The Last Dog on Earths main strength was the [...] "well-developed and sympathetic protagonist" [...] Logan, but noted that the [...] "memos and several subplots" [...] interspersed between chapters and Ehrenhaft's [...] " [...] heavy-handed" [...] attempts to foreshadow were drawbacks.

[...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E

500|$|The golden jackal's {{omnivorous}} diet {{allows it}} to eat a large range of foods and to live in different habitats. The jackal's long legs and lithe body allow it <b>to</b> <b>trot</b> over great distances in search of food. It is able to go without water for extended periods and has been observed on islands that have no fresh water. Jackals are abundant in valleys, alongside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores, but they are rare in foothills and low mountains. They avoid waterless deserts but {{can be found at}} their edges or in oases. They are found in dense thickets of prickly bushes, reed flood-lands and forests. They have been known to ascend over [...] up the slopes of the Himalayas; they can withstand temperatures as low as [...] and sometimes [...] They are not adapted to snow, and in snow country they must travel along paths made by larger animals or humans. In India, they will occupy the surrounding foothills above arable areas, entering human settlements at night to feed on garbage, and have established themselves around hill stations at [...] height above mean sea level. They generally avoid mountainous forests, but may enter alpine and sub-alpine areas during dispersal. In Turkey, the Caucasus, and Transcaucasia they have been observed up to [...] above mean sea level, particularly in areas where the climate supports shrublands in high elevations.|$|E

[...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{variations}} of the trot are specially trained in advanced dressage horses: the Piaffe and the Passage.

Both require tremendous collection, careful training and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform.|$|E

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "natural" [...] gaits, {{in increasing}} order of speed, are the walk, trot, canter, and gallop. Some consider these as three gaits, with the canter {{a variation of}} the gallop, even though the canter is distinguished by having three beats, whereas the gallop has four beats. All four gaits are seen in wild horse populations. While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some horses, these four basic gaits occur in nature across almost all horse breeds. In some animals the trot is replaced by the pace or an ambling gait. Horses who possess an ambling gait are usually also able <b>to</b> <b>trot.</b>|$|E
