60|$|Dody Wardwell <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> go to a shopkeeper who dealt in such goods, and, {{telling the}} story, beg what was needed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, {{unless he}} <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{try to break}} out, and if so he would have them along to stop us," [...] {{answered}} Jack.|$|E
6000|$|... "The truth is," [...] said Michael Moon with {{comparative}} courtesy, [...] "we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> see if {{they had}} made you comfortable. Miss Duke is rather--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{sister of}} mine,' said Tom, 'when you say that, you are near my <b>thoughts.</b> <b>We</b> <b>might</b> {{be so much}} oftener {{together}} - mightn't we? Always together, almost - mightn't we? It would do {{me a great deal}} of good if you were to make up your mind to I know what, Loo. It would be a splendid thing for me. It would be uncommonly jolly!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have not," [...] O'Neil said. [...] "We {{came away}} {{in such a}} hurry that we did not think of it until on the road, and then <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> procure them here." ...|$|R
40|$|Descartes famously {{argued that}} animals were mere machines, without thought or {{conscious}}ness. Few would now share this view. But if other animals have conscious lives, {{what are they}} like, how do they differ from ours, and how would we ever know anything about them? This lecture will address this question {{by looking at the}} kinds of <b>thoughts</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> share with animals, and looking at philosophical and empirical arguments for how our thoughts might differ from theirs...|$|R
6000|$|... "Becky, I {{was such}} a fool! Such a fool! I never <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> want to come back! No--I can't find the way. It's all mixed up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mean {{to disturb}} you, darling," [...] he said, gently, [...] "but {{as we were}} alone, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have one of our old-fashioned talks, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|He even seemed {{offended}} at our remarks. He said he {{had picked}} us out the best boat in all his stock, and he <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have been more grateful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! There {{are several}} rooms quite ready. Mrs. Midgeley <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> be {{bringing}} down some guests. I am {{quite sure that}} we can make Doctor Harrison comfortable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a time,--a {{very short}} time,--during which I <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{hit it off}} together, and I did my best. You do not, I fancy, like men of my class." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} {{that you were going to}} church," [...] he said; [...] "I <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have had a walk together. Very likely I shall have to go away early to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cerebos salt," [...] she said. [...] "One gets {{carried away}} a little. I just {{got hold of}} it and carried {{it out to the}} car. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have to salt things later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then,' Eames went on, 'he became rather noisome, and we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well impound the correspondence'--he {{wrinkled}} his swelled left eye--'and after that, {{we got him}} to take a seat in my car.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure,--the one I bought when we {{were out}} west. I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> use it for {{climbing}} purposes. It is light but strong, and we can lasso a tree or stump up there with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{they had}} gone a long, long way {{they came to a}} little house, and when the girl looked into it she found it was quite empty, and she <b>thought</b> 'perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> stay and live here.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Emir {{listened to}} all but said little. At length, however, he asked whether we were willing to become Moslems, since if so he <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> go free. <b>We</b> {{answered}} {{that we were not}} willing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. It is {{four miles}} nearer than Ballyhovey, so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well meet you here, and more comfortably than meeting {{you in the}} town. It was Mary's suggestion. I think {{she would not have}} liked to have kissed Terence in the public street." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{came last}} night, Dr. Greatrex,' {{answered}} the dreaded parent respectfully: 'we've {{come down from}} Staffordshire for {{a week at the}} seaside, and we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well be within hail of Guy and Charlie.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{if you are}} wise, {{answer me}} a few questions," [...] Crawshay began. [...] "I'd have brought the captain with me, but I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> do better {{business}} alone. You've been advertising the ship's whereabouts. Why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hodder {{turned his}} eyes from her face. [...] "Miss Marcy has been lonely," [...] he explained, [...] "and I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> get her a room near by, where she might see them often. She {{is going to do}} embroidery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father and}} I {{want to get}} down the coast {{as far as the}} Downs. Now <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> just as well give your boat a turn and have your son and {{yourself}} to work it. I suppose she is fit to go that distance?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{were hoping}} for a {{stalking}} trip," [...] said Motion. [...] "We were hoping that somebody else would go for it. We were forced to go to Plan B. Turning for home, I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> just <b>might</b> have it. But it's a long way home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no idea, sir. I <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{be going}} up the creek that Lieutenant Hopkins {{explored}} the other day, to have {{another look at the}} prahus; but as we came down the river instead of going up, of course it is not that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jude quietly, as he {{took charge}} of the small child, and told Arabella's boy to keep close to them, Sue {{attending}} to their own eldest. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well come to-day as on any other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had friends}} in the prison, and we <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> do {{something}} to save them," [...] Harry answered, for he saw {{that it would be}} his best policy to be frank. [...] "It was his father whom they brought out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{idea was}} for the gal and your nevy to come too," [...] ses pore Ginger. [...] "Then I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> lose ’im and I would ’ave a little chat with the gal, and show ’er ’ow foolish she was." ...|$|E
6000|$|MARY. I pray you be not so disconsolate; I {{still will}} do mine utmost with the Pope. Poor cousin! Have not I been the fast friend {{of your life}} Since mine began, and it was <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> two <b>Might</b> make one flesh, and cleave unto each other As man and wife? ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was not in}} {{our minds}} that we would remain very long with our new commander. Sergeant Corney {{believed}} General Herkimer had some especial matter in hand in which he <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> three <b>might</b> be of particular service, and when that was done we {{would be allowed to}} return home.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. For {{two days}} <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>might</b> die at any minute. It was--it was rather dreadful.|$|R
60|$|I answered, laughing, that I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{get through}} it in that time, but that he must come also; for he would find that his renown had preceded him, {{and that he was}} almost as great a personage as I was.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's very well, dear;--but what {{if one is}} ruffled? But I won't be ruffled, and {{you shall}} come. When I thought that I should go again to our own house, then I <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> perhaps {{dispense}} with the ruffling;--that was all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Five {{miles from}} here is a smaller cave. The {{sentinels}} have just finished searching it. They will {{be here in the}} morning. I have <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> slip past them, by exercising great caution, and it would be just so much nearer the coast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank ye; thank ye all," [...] said Gabriel. [...] "A bit and a drop {{shall be}} sent to Warren's for ye at once. I had a <b>thought</b> that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> very likely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was saying so to my wife but now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>thought</b> {{that perhaps}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> {{be of some}} assistance," [...] said Bertha, timidly. [...] "If there is {{anything}} which {{we could do to}} make you feel more at home----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--exactly; no doubt;--but I <b>thought</b> {{that perhaps}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> better {{understand}} each other {{if we had a}} few words of quiet conversation upon the subject. I believe you know the steps that I have--" ...|$|R
