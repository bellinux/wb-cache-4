It premiered in January at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was later a personal selection of Roger Ebert, shown at his 15th annual film festival in Champaign, Illinois.

[...] Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism.

500|$|Arguing that The Day After <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>is</b> [...] "kinda like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey... for kids", science-fiction {{writer and}} {{reviewer}} Christopher Mills expresses disappointment with {{the effect of}} the black hole itself, but describes the fall into the anomaly as [...] "very colourful". However, in contrast with Muir, he views the sequences set inside Altares during the descent as [...] "a bit of a hoot", directing particular criticism at the actors' exaggerated gesticulations. Commenting that the plot contains [...] "plenty of wonky pseudo-science and insanely improbable coincidences", Mills also recalls his fascination at [...] "how 'British'... the characters , facing each new peril with remarkable calm and 'stiff upper lip' stoicism. By the time they're caught in the clutches of the ominous black hole, they're apparently so resigned to being jerked around by the universe that they just hold hands and calmly await their fate." ...|$|E

500|$|Muir {{suggests}} that the feel of The Day After <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a little more colourful (less minimalist) in colour and costume than Space: 1999s sterling [...] ", with such elements as Wadsworth's [...] "hard-hitting, hard-driving musical score" [...] livening up the proceedings. The music has also received praise from Law, who notes a [...] "dynamic pace", as well as Anderson himself. Muir summarises the final product as a [...] "Year One-style 'awe and mystery of space' narrative, but one conveyed in the more colourful-looking or -sounding [...] fashion", and a [...] "time capsule of once-state-of-the-art science fiction". To Law, it is [...] "half-forgotten experiment which is now perhaps only of interest to aficionados", but [...] "an interesting look at what might have been" [...] if Anderson {{had been able to}} produce a full series. Mills interprets it as a [...] "solid little piece of 70s juvenile sci-fi" [...] that is perhaps [...] "not quite as 'scientifically accurate' as it pretends to be, but fun".|$|E
500|$|Rivera {{exhibited}} a reserved demeanor {{on the field}} that contrasted with the emotional, demonstrative temperament {{of many of his}} peers. Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having [...] "ice water in his veins". Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations, Rivera said, [...] "When you start thinking, a lot of things will happen... If you don't control your emotions, your emotions will control your acts, and that's not good." [...] His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain, who said, [...] "He's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball, and he's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run." [...] Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances, saying [...] "the game that you're going to play <b>tomorrow</b> <b>is</b> {{not going to be the}} same game that you just played." [...] Derek Jeter called him the [...] "most mentally tough" [...] teammate with whom he had ever played.|$|E
500|$|Several {{directors}} {{associated with}} noir built well-respected oeuvres largely at the B-movie/intermediate level. Samuel Fuller's brutal, visually energetic {{films such as}} Pickup on South Street (1953) and Underworld U.S.A. (1961) earned him a unique reputation; his advocates praise him as [...] "primitive" [...] and [...] "barbarous". Joseph H. Lewis directed noirs as diverse as Gun Crazy (1950) and The Big Combo (1955). The former—whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, disguised by a front—features a bank hold-up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential. The Big Combo was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits. The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson (The Phenix City Story [...] and The Brothers Rico [...] ) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale. The work of other directors in this tier of the industry, such as Felix E. Feist (The Devil Thumbs a Ride , <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Is</b> Another Day [...] ), has become obscure. Edgar G. Ulmer {{spent most of his}} Hollywood career working at B studios {{and once in a while}} on projects that achieved intermediate status; for the most part, on unmistakable Bs. In 1945, while at PRC, he directed a noir cult classic, Detour. Ulmer's other noirs include Strange Illusion (1945), also for PRC; Ruthless (1948), for Eagle-Lion, which had acquired PRC the previous year and Murder Is My Beat (1955), for Allied Artists.|$|E
