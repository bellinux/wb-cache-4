30|$|The average pore <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> is {{positively}} correlated with the water-free and ultimate stage oil displacement efficiencies, with respective correlation coefficients of 0.8256 and 0.9025 (Fig.  10). When the <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> is less than 1  µm, oil displacement efficiency sharply increases with the increasing <b>throat</b> <b>radius,</b> which then turns to be gentle when the <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> is greater than 1  µm. This indicates the influence of <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> and throat permeability contribution curve on oil displacement efficiency. Under the same experimental conditions, more evenly distributed <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> can contribute to smoother seepage path, larger sweeping area, and higher displacement efficiency {{when it comes to}} the throats with similar or equal radius. As the main factor influencing oil displacement efficiency, <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> can more intuitively and truly characterize the reservoir under the action of sedimentary and diagenetic alternation.|$|E
30|$|On {{the basis}} of analysis, {{it can be found}} that the main {{influential}} factor of porosity is throat radius; the main influential factors of permeability include <b>throat</b> <b>radius,</b> <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> uniformity coefficient, aspect ratio and coordination number; the main influential factors of relative permeability include <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> uniformity coefficient, aspect ratio, wettability, shape of pore throat, and coordination number. It also indicates that wettability and shape of pore throat have a greater impact on irreducible water saturation; aspect ratio and shape of pore throat affect residual oil saturation largely. Additionally, the micro-parameters that influence the ratio of endpoint relative permeability to a great extent are <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> uniformity coefficient, aspect ratio, and coordination number.|$|E
50|$|Porosity can be {{proportional}} to hydraulic conductivity; for two similar sandy aquifers, {{the one with}} a higher porosity will typically have a higher hydraulic conductivity (more open area for the flow of water), {{but there are many}} complications to this relationship. The principal complication is {{that there is not a}} direct proportionality between porosity and hydraulic conductivity but rather an inferred proportionality. There is a clear proportionality between pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> and hydraulic conductivity. Also, there tends to be a proportionality between pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> and pore volume. If the proportionality between pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> and porosity exists then a proportionality between porosity and hydraulic conductivity may exist. However, as grain size or sorting decreases the proportionality between pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> and porosity begins to fail and therefore so does the proportionality between porosity and hydraulic conductivity. For example: clays typically have very low hydraulic conductivity (due to their small pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii)</b> but also have very high porosities (due to the structured nature of clay minerals), which means clays can hold a large volume of water per volume of bulk material, but they do not release water rapidly and therefore have low hydraulic conductivity.|$|R
30|$|After the Winland {{multiple}} regression analysis approach was published, this method was applied to many other areas. However, the best correlation of the porosity and the air permeability to pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> does not always correspond to the mercury saturation of 35  %.

30|$|There {{are obvious}} {{differences}} in the water displacement pattern and oil displacement efficiency among four types of pore structures. The size and distribution of the <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> are the key factors affecting the water flooding efficiency; better reservoir properties contribute to higher oil displacement efficiency; better pore structure corresponds to larger <b>throat</b> <b>radius,</b> better sorting, more macro pores and throats, more uniform pore throat distribution, and consequently higher oil displacement efficiency; the pore <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> ratio {{is the most important}} parameter to characterize the reservoir heterogeneity, and the smaller pore <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> ratio means closer size between pores and throats, resulting in the higher seepage capacity and ultimate stage oil displacement efficiency; microscopic pore structure parameters are key factors that affect oil displacement efficiency.|$|E

Several empirical and quasi-empirical approaches have been used over the years to derive pore structure information from the particle size distribution. In this study, we used the discrete element method to simulate the pore structure of various sands as affected by compaction and particle mixing processes. We used five sands with different mean grain sizes to investigate the effects of different sand mixing ratios and degrees of compaction on pore structure {{as well as on the}} intrinsic permeability and the soil water retention curve. Average pore body and pore throat sizes were found to be determined mostly by the smaller particles as represented by the effective diameter D 10. The effects of compaction on the average pore body and pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> were used to simulate expected decreases in the permeability. We obtained mostly linear relationships between permeability and the average pore body and <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> when mixing different unimodal sands. The intrinsic permeability of the coarser sands was found to be far more sensitive to porosity than the finer sands. Simulations of unsaturated conditions showed that the van Genuchten hydraulic parameter a increased nonlinearly with increasing grain size and mean pore body size of the sand mixtures. Compaction caused a linear decrease in a with decreasing porosity and pore body size. However, no clear correlation between the van Genuchten parameter n and porosity or D 10 was found for the different compaction and mixing simulations...|$|R
30|$|The Ordovician {{carbonate}} reservoirs in the Tarim Basin with secondary dissolution pores and vugs have complicated pore structures. The weathering crust reservoirs mainly {{consist of}} large cavities or vugs connected by fractures, {{but most of}} the reef-shoal reservoirs have complex and small throats among matrix pores.

Most of the average <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> falls between 0.03 and 0.and 0.07 urn, close to that of unconventional reservoirs except in local areas with developed fractures. Fluid driving force analysis shows that the differentiation of fluid is mainly controlled by the <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> in two kinds of mechanism separated by the critical <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> about 0.1 urn. There is obvious fluid differentiation and oil/gas/water contact in fracture-cavity reservoirs with big throats. However, most of reservoirs under the critical <b>throat</b> <b>radius</b> have high capillary pressure, which resulted in incomplete differentiation of gas/oil/water, and complicated fluid distribution and fluid properties in the unconventional reservoirs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR), stable isotope geochemistry of micro-sampled cores, NMR well-logs and 3 D modeling {{are used to}} investigate the carbonate permeability-porosity heterogeneity along 230 m-thick limestones of the Paris Basin. Despite the global low porosity and permeability of the limestones, two aquifers units with porosity greater than 15 % were identified. These two aquifers are very different in terms of pore through radii and NMR signal. The first one (A 1 : Aquifer 1) is a 7 m-thick mudstone unit, dominated by extended microporosity with pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> of 0, 25 μm to 0, 3 μm. The second one (A 2 : Aquifer 2) is a 15 m-thick oolitic grainstone units showing macropores reaching 100 μm and pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> of 32 μm. From core descriptions and wireline logs on 26 wells, a 3 D static geological model is build. The fine tuning of permeability calculations from NMR logs realized along 12 of the wells, allows porosity and permeability heterogeneity to be distributed within a 3 D model at the reservoir scale (area of about 2000 km 2) which match the flow behavior illustrated by well tests. Associated with early meteoric calcite cements and poorly developed burial blocky calcite cements, the porous and permeable intervals may be predicted in two stratigraphic and diagenetic considerations. Firstly, the syn-sedimentary meteoric dissolution or neomorphism of the initial high magnesium calcite and aragonite particles or clasts into low magnesium calcite particles or cements prevented most mechanical and chemical compaction during the first steps of burial. Secondly, the regional stratigraphic architecture reveals the presence of local permeability barriers, which prevented Early Cretaceous lateral meteoric water circulation and the associated burial calcite cementation...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Understanding the {{degassing}} {{process in}} magma {{is an important}} goal because of the first-order control it exerts on determining eruption style. Degassing in high viscosity magmas {{is of particular interest}} since these magmas tend to erupt explosively. However, the role of phenocrysts in the degassing process is still poorly constrained, though recent data indicate that the presence of phenocrysts should promote permeability development at lower porosities than in crystal-free magmas. This study specifically examined the effect of phenocrysts in a rhyolitic magma, but the results can also be applied to crystal-rich intermediate magmas that have rhyolitic matrix melts. Isothermal decompression experiments were conducted using powdered rhyolite (76 wt. % SiO 2) and seeded with corundum (Al 2 O 3) crystals to approximate magmas with 20 and 40 vol. % phenocrysts. Experiments were saturated at 900 ˚C and 110 MPa then continuously decompressed to final pressures between 75 and 15 MPa. Percolation threshold was determined by measuring permeability on a benchtop permeameter and measuring porosity from reflected light images. Additionally, vesicle structure was assessed by measuring pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> from back-scattered electron images and plotting bubble size distributions. Finally, degassing state was checked by measuring dissolved water contents in the glass with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses. The addition of at least 20 vol. % phenocrysts resulted in a decrease in percolation threshold from 70 - 80 vol. % porosity in crystal-free rhyolites to 55 vol. % porosity. Bubble size distribution patterns indicate that coalescence was more widespread as final pressure decreased and crystal content increased. Minimum pore <b>throat</b> <b>radii</b> in the 40 vol. % phenocryst series were larger than in the 20 vol. % phenocryst and crystal-free series. The dissolved water measurements indicate that these experiments degassed in equilibrium even at the fast decompression rate of 0. 25 MPa/s. Calculations of the magnitude of outgassing from the decreased percolation threshold and timescales of pressure dissipation indicate that the presence of phenocrysts plays a role in the effusive-explosive cyclicity of Vulcanian-style eruptions...|$|R
