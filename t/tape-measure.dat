40|$|Horses {{have been}} companions to humans for {{thousands}} of years, both as work animals {{and as part of}} our culture. The Old Kladruber horse is a Czech autochthonous breed included in animal genetic resources. The aim of my thesis was to assess the gradual change in the external features of Old Kladruber horses in the years 1900 2013 in both the colour variants. I focused on 5 body measurements (height at the withers measured by tape, height at the withers measured by stick, girth of chest, girth of bone) collected for 1021 horses registered in the breed registry. The obtained values have been summarized and subsequently statistically and graphically evaluated. The results imply that values of wither height of Old Kladruber horses measured both by tape and stick have been increasing, whereas their weight has slightly dropped. In white horses, the average increase in the <b>tape-measured</b> wither height amounted to 3. 5 cm and to 7 cm in black horses. Stick height at the withers has shown an increase ranging between 3 4. 7 cm in white horses, while in black horses, the values ranged between 6 10 cm. In stallions, the chest girth was determined at 197. 5 cm. White mares had a chest girth of 199. 55 cm. Almost identical value, i. e. 198. 13 cm, was determined for black mares. The bone girth has remained almost unchanged. A slight decrease was observed in white Old Kladruber horses stallions in the years 1970 2013 by 0. 5 cm. This change was most probably caused by the addition of blood of other breeds in the past. A drop in the weight was monitored over the time interval of 1930 2013 and it ranged between 22 kg and 73 kg according to the monitored group. This drop in the weight and increase in the body frame implies a change in the type of the horse, tending rather to the sports type. However, this change can also be affected by the conditions in the environment. Only in unique cases, the values of the variation coefficient in the years 1990 2013 exceeded the limit of 10 %. Groups of monitored horses of both colour variants can thus be considered balanced. In the years 1990 2013, several horses of a non-compliant standard height were also included in the breed. This was required as part of the attempt to preserve all of the existing lines and families as well as to keep the coefficient of relationship low...|$|R

60|$|He decided {{first that}} it would be a useless waste of {{material}} to build a stage entirely across one end of the attic, since they would not be crowded from lack of room, owing to the small number of performers, and after a great amount of pacing back and forth, as well as mental calculation, he drew two chalk lines at supposed equal distances from the walls. Between these lines he measured with his fragment of a <b>tape-measure,</b> and found that it was exactly thirty times the length of the tape. Thirty times eight inches was, therefore, the length of his proposed stage, or, more properly speaking, his platform, and he seated himself, with a look of perplexity on his face and a remarkably small piece of lead-pencil in his mouth, to figure up the grand total of inches. He could multiply the cipher easily enough, for he was positive that the answer would be the same, however large the multiplier might be; but the question of how much eight times three was troubled him greatly.|$|E

5000|$|In Game 4, needing another win to {{keep their}} season alive, the Giants' offense finally came to life.

Pitching for the Giants, Barry Zito struggled early, walking three consecutive Reds hitters {{in the first inning}} to force in a run.

Zito continued to struggle, needing 76 pitches to complete just under three innings of work. George Kontos relieved Zito, and retired both batters he faced in the third. Back-to-back doubles by Joaquín Árias and Pagán, followed by a Pablo Sandoval sacrifice fly gave the Giants a 5-2 lead, and in came Tim Lincecum.

40|$|Viruses with an icosahedrally {{symmetric}} protein capsid and a membrane infect hosts {{from all}} three domains of life. Similar architectural principles are shared by different viral families, as exemplified by double-stranded DNA viruses such as PRD 1 and STIV. During virus assembly, the membrane lipids are selectively acquired from the host cell. The X-ray structure of bacteriophage PRD 1 revealed that the lipids are asymmetrically distributed between the two leaflets and facet length is controlled by a <b>tape-measure</b> protein. In most membrane-containing viruses, viral and host membranes fuse during viral entry. In the best-understood systems of the alphaviruses, flaviviruses and herpes viruses, fusion is mediated by viral glycoproteins. Recent structural advances reveal how very different protein architectures {{can be used to}} form trimeric extensions that extend into the target cell membrane and then fold back to mediate fusion of the target and viral membranes...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD 1 has been determined by X-ray crystallography at about 4 A resolution. Here we describe the structure and location of proteins P 3, P 16, P 30 and P 31. Different structural proteins seem to have specialist roles in controlling virus assembly. The linearly extended P 30 appears to nucleate {{the formation of the}} icosahedral facets (composed of trimers of the major capsid protein, P 3) and acts as a molecular <b>tape-measure,</b> defining the size of the virus and cementing the facets together. Pentamers of P 31 form the vertex base, interlocking with subunits of P 3 and interacting with the membrane protein P 16. The architectural similarities with adenovirus and one of the largest known virus particles PBCV- 1 support the notion that the mechanism of assembly of PRD 1 is scaleable and applies across the major viral lineage formed by these viruses...|$|E

Data collection was done by questionnaires and physical examination (posture screen, <b>tape-measure,</b> Scales and…). The results were analyzed by SPSS software Results: In general, {{the results of this study}} indicated that abnormal posture in male was 57. 67 % and in female was 68. 89 %. additionally, there was a significant relationship between the level of kyphosis and lordosis and sleep habit, between shoulder dropping and briefcase carriage, between Bow leg and sitting between Hallux Valgus and high heel shoes of subjects (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Considering the generated results, the level and rate of deformity among youngsters is very high.
