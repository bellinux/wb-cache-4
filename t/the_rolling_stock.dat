5|$|There are {{political}} signals to prioritize electrification the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer plus the Meråker Line. NSB {{will need to}} replace <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> in the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with electrification.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May 1993 all of <b>the</b> old <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was withdrawn, <b>the</b> {{train service}} being {{suspended}} temporarily. A temporary bus service was run while <b>the</b> old <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> was physically removed and <b>the</b> new <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> brought in, {{and the track}} and signalling works undertaken, with staff training. The line reopened on 19 July 1993, with a peak service frequency of 3½ minutes.|$|R

5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems {{was established by}} Rasmus Surdal. The company {{would be allowed to}} use <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and infrastructure, and two of the trains were painted white. However, it was not possible for the company to get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB, and nothing came of the plans.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closing}} in 1991 the {{foundation}} Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen {{was established to}} ensure that the railway remained in an operational condition, and kept the two railway ferries and some of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> in operational condition. Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line, while the Tinnoset Line remained part of the rail network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The foundation operated ad-hoc charter services on both the Tinnoset Line and the Rjukan Line, as well as with both railway ferries. By 2004 the foundation had run out of money, and closed down.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, {{in one of the}} last major air raids on London, bombs {{repeatedly}} fell on the Waterloo area, and the LNC's good fortune in avoiding damage to their facilities finally ran out.

Following the left-winged Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet's victory in the 2005 parliamentary election, the new Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, announced {{that there would be no}} more public tenders in the railway sector. The government stated that experience from Sweden and the United Kingdom showed that employees rights and safety was reduced after privatization was introduced.|$|E
5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b> New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. <b>The</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E
50|$|This {{train service}} was removed last May 23, 2014 {{to give way}} to {{maintenance}} servicing of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks.</b> Another reason was the 3 consecutive weeks of delays and cancellations of some train trips.|$|R

5|$|In April 2006, Ofotbanen {{declared}} {{that they were}} in severe financial difficulties. Accounts payable were giving liquidity problems, and Ofotbanen announced that they needed more capital, estimated at NOK 8 million. GB Group said they were not willing to invest more money in the railway company. Ofotbanen had then been losing money continually since the start-up in 2001; in 2004, it had a deficit of NOK 4 million of a NOK 20 million revenue. At the extraordinary general meeting on 4 September 2006, the company was sold for NOK 1 million to Rail Management, a holding company for the London-based shipping owner Mons Bolin. In November, the Norwegian Rail Inspectorate threatened to withdraw the company's safety license, since they had failed to show proper maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Oslo Tramway is a six-line tram {{and light}} rail network {{that serves the}} central parts of Oslo, Norway, of which three lines stretch into the suburbs. The Oslo Metro is a six-line rapid transit system that covers all boroughs of Oslo and some of western Bærum. Currently, the {{infrastructure}} of both systems {{is owned by the}} municipal company Sporveien (Kollektivtransportproduksjon). The tramway is operated by the subsidiary Sporveien Trikken (previously Oslotrikken), while the metro is operated by Sporveien T-banen (previously Oslo T-banedrift) and <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is owned by the subsidiary Oslo Vognselskap. All operations are conducted on contract with Ruter, the public transport authority for Oslo and Akershus, which operates the ticket system and manages public grants.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} deficits {{are covered}} through subsidies by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications. The trackage and other infrastructure {{is owned by}} the government agency Norwegian National Rail Administration, while <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> is owned and operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The service between Stavanger and Sandnes operate with a fixed schedule every 15 minutes. Of the trains to Sandnes, half continue onwards to Nærbø, giving a 30-minute headway. One train per hour operate all the way to Egersund. On weekends and late evenings, there is a reduced service. Travel time from Stavanger to Sandnes is 19 minutes, from Stavanger to Nærbø is 37 minutes, and from Stavanger to Egersund is 1 hour and 7 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Competition and {{regulation}} in railways: {{the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> - <b>The</b> liberalization process in the railway industry is highly influenced by <b>the</b> availability of <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks.</b> Although these assets are duplicable and cannot therefore be defined as essential facilities, evidence from many countries shows that they represent the most relevant barrier to entry in the market. In this paper, following the UK experience, we analyse the role of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stocks</b> and <b>the</b> hypothesis of a vertical separation of these assets from the present owner, i. e. the incumbent operator Trenitalia SpA. We therefore evaluate {{the pros and cons}} of a potential de-integration of the Italian railway industry in order to enhance market competitiveness and the overall efficiency of this industry..

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> of Oslo Metro, Norway has {{consisted}} of three classes: T1000/T1300, T2000 and MX3000. The T1000 was built as 162 single cars from 1964 to 1978. From 1979 to 1985, 33 new T1300 trains were built, followed by the conversion of 16 T1000s. Six two-car T2000 units were delivered in 1994. Since 2005, the first 83 three-car MX3000 units have been replacing the older stock, and the last T1000 was retired in 2007. From 2010, only MX3000-trains are in use. The T1000/T1300 and T2000 were built by Strømmens Værksted, with motors from Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB) and AEG, respectively, and the MX3000 were built by Siemens.|$|E

As bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area, <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> parked in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was badly damaged. Multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building. While the LNC's office building and the station platforms survived, the central section of the station was reduced to rubble. On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed.|$|E
5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} equipment were constructed in Japan, many parts were sourced from Europe. The trains were fitted with Stone Platt air-conditioning, Duwag bogies, Sig gangways, Scharfenberg couplers and Westinghouse brakes. Mitsubishi Electric's {{propulsion equipment}} {{was estimated to}} consume 50% less electricity than Hong Kong's existing MTR M-Train EMU. Its Automatic Train Control (ATC) signalling system was supplied by Westinghouse, capable of running at pre-programmed speeds and activated by the train driver. While theoretically possible to design for a fully driverless operation using this signalling technology, MRT Corporation (MRTC, now SMRT Corporation) decided against this option. The trainsets were assembled in Kobe, Japan, and then shipped to Singapore by Neptune Orient Lines. The first trainset was delivered to MRTC on 8 July 1986 at Bishan Depot, officiated by Yeo Ning Hong.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Telemark County Municipality had {{attempted}} to create a PSO contract for {{the operation of the}} Bratsberg Line, that had been transferred from the state to the county. Five private companies had bid, but all five had been disqualified and the county was forced to sign a concession contract with NSB instead, despite NSB not having bid in the tender. The same year, the national process was delayed one year. However, the government announced that the bidding would happen in three stages; first the Gjøvik Line and Bergen Commuter Rail, second the long-distance trains as well as the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and finally the rest of the Oslo Commuter Rail, as well as the Jæren Commuter Rail. Among the challenges was the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>stock</b> and depots. The department considered creating a separate government-owned company that would own these. Since NSB had been converted to a limited company, it would be necessary for the state to purchase the trains and depots for full price from NSB. With 69 multiple units delivered within the past five years, this could become an expensive transaction for the state. An alternative was launched were NSB would have to lease locomotives, carriages and multiple units to the winner, and also sell tickets for them at railway stations, a solution that was later chosen. In September 2004, it was announced that current employees working for NSB along the Gjøvik Line would have the right to work for the winner, and could demand the same wage and pension rights as before.|$|E
