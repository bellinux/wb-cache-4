40|$|Mouse {{hepatitis}} {{virus strain}} A 59 produces chronic <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> demyelination in rodents. As late as 6 months after intracerebral inoculation of mice 4 to 6 weeks old, when infectious virus cannot be recovered and viral antigens cannot be detected in <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> and livers of these animals, primary demyelination is still evident.

5|$|Lead {{affects the}} {{peripheral}} nervous system (especially motor nerves) and <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children. Lead causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> such as insomnia, delirium, cognitive deficits, tremor, hallucinations, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E

5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|Chondrostean fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) {{possess a}} major {{site for the}} {{production}} of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges (membranes surrounding <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.)</b> Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, reticular cells and a small number of macrophages. The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Of all the alkaloids, only {{galantamine}} {{has made}} it to therapeutic use in man, as the drug galantamine for Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine is an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor which crosses the blood brain barrier and is active within <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Daffodils are grown commercially near Brecon in Powys, Wales, to produce galantamine, a drug used to combat Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E

50|$|Combining {{multiple}} depressants can be {{very dangerous}} because <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system's</b> depressive properties have been proposed to increase exponentially instead of linearly. This characteristic makes depressants a common choice for deliberate overdoses {{in the case of}} suicide. The use of alcohol or benzodiazepines along with the usual dose of heroin is often the cause of overdose deaths in opiate addicts.|$|R
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Lead forms {{a variety}} of {{compounds}} and exists in the environment in various forms. Features of poisoning differ {{depending on whether the}} agent is an organic compound (one that contains carbon), or an inorganic one. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> predominantly.|$|E
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
40|$|The A 7 {{strain of}} Semliki Forest virus induces rapid fetal death in {{pregnant}} mice, whereas the ts 22 mutant derived from it is teratogenic for {{a proportion of}} fetuses. Both A 7 and ts 22 induce viremia and infect <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> and fetuses of pregnant mice. Using immunogold-silver staining, a cDNA probe for a Semliki Forest virus nonstructural sequence, and a riboprobe derived from the same sequence, we showed that the skin and musculoskeletal systems of fetuses from mothers infected with ts 22 were often heavily infected but <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> were not labeled before day 17 of pregnancy. Damage to the neural tube, including open-neural-tube defects, was detected in fetuses following infection of the mother at days 8 and 10 of pregnancy with both A 7 and ts 22. For ts 22, neural tube damage induced by fetal infection before day 17 of pregnancy appeared to be indirect and caused by virus infection of mesenchymal cells surrounding the developing neural tube...|$|R

5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use of two or more serotonergic medications or drugs. This may include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), amphetamines, pethidine (meperidine), tramadol, dextromethorphan, buspirone, L-tryptophan, 5-HTP, St. John's wort, triptans, ecstasy (MDMA), metoclopramide, ondansetron, or cocaine. It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.
