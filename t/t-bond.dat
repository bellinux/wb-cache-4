However, after reforms were implemented in December 2002, foreign investors are now allowed (with limitations) to trade in A shares under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program which was officially launched in 2003. Currently, a total of 98 foreign institutional investors have been approved to buy and sell A shares under the QFII program. Quotas under the QFII program are currently US$30 billion. There has been a plan to eventually merge the two types of shares in the future.|$|E

Data are examined for selected periods, stable (1992) and unstable (1988). Remarkably different results were found over commodities, time period, and sample size. Actual spread {{changes for the}} smaller sample size of gold and <b>T-bonds</b> and of corn produced more normal distributions as intervals were widened from daily to weekly, while all live cattle spreads for actual changes were normally distributed. However, the larger sample size of both gold and <b>T-bonds</b> and the relative spread changes for both corn and live cattle did not converge to a normal distribution. The "best fit" distribution was tested nonparametrically on all daily spread samples, and the logistic distribution prevailed, which supported the results of nonnormality from parametric distributional tests.

FACTORS AFFECTING <b>T-BOND</b> HEDGE RATIO INSTABILITY Unstable hedge ratios can adversely affect the measure of hedging effectiveness in the regression approach to minimize risk. This paper examines the relative importance of the correlation coefficient versus the standard deviation ratio as the cause of unstable hedge ratios using <b>T-bond</b> futures. The paper concludes that the standard deviation ratio is significantly more important than the correlation coefficient in determining changes in the hedge ratio for the Bellwether series, while both the standard deviation ratio and the correlation coefficient are important for the two-year T-note series. These results have implications for forecasting and analyzing hedge ratios when the hedge ratios are unstable over time. 2 FACTORS AFFECTING <b>T-BOND</b> HEDGE RATIO INSTABILITY I...|$|E

We show that the <b>T-bond</b> market and the bond-stock correlations bear more of {{the brunt of the}} macroeconomic contractions. We also find that the bond-stock correlations respond more strongly to joint negative than joint positive shocks, implying that investors tend to move both the <b>T-bond</b> and stock prices in the same direction when the two asset classes have been hit concurrently by bad news, but tend to shift funds from one asset class to the other when hit concurrently by good news. However, the stock-stock correlation is found to increase for joint positive shocks, indicating that investors tend to herd more for joint bullish than joint bearish stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of the Black-Scholes-Merton options pricing model and its publication in 1973, expanded risk management financial research and practice. Concurrently, {{there have been many}} assets created in the derivative markets. In line with this, the introduction of Australian Treasury-Bond futures overnight options at the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) during 1993 offers a unique opportunity to examine trading behavior with a different market microstructure. This dissertation is the first study of its kind to investigate the market microstructure of the SFE overnight options market. This work explores market microstructure aspects of Australian Treasury Bond futures overnight options regarding market liquidity, transaction costs, market order flows, information asymmetry, and market volatility. We first present an institutional overview of the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) and discussions about products traded at the SFE. This builds the foundation for the following empirical studies. Next, we examine trading behaviours of 3 -Year and 10 -Year <b>T-Bond</b> futures overnight options by looking at intra-night bid-ask spreads, trading volume, and volatility patterns. We observe different intra-night bid-ask spreads, trading volume, and volatility patterns compared to stocks and long dated options. Third, the impact of overnight options introduction on the underlying 3 -Year and 10 -Year <b>T-Bond</b> futures market is examined. Results indicate that the introduction of overnight options has influence on the underlying 3 -Year and 10 -Year <b>T-Bond</b> futures. Fourth, we examine information shocks on the underlying futures return volatility and present optimal time-varying models to estimate and forecast the underlying futures return volatility. The analysis undertaken allows us to recommend the most appropriate models for predicting return volatility for the underlying futures market, and hence presents a key element in the puzzle of how best to price these innovative products. Finally, implied, forecasted, and realized volatility are examined to determine information content of implied volatility when predicting future volatility. This information may be useful to traders wishing to accurately price overnight options...|$|E

For the first topic, we provide a new method to derive the state price density per unit probability based on option prices and GARCH model. We derive the risk neutral distribution using the result in Breeden and Litzenberger (1978) and the historical density adapting the GARCH model of Barone-Adesi, Engle, and Mancini (2008). For the second topic, the first article deals with the immunization of a portfolio of treasury bonds against interest rate risk and in particular we test alternative models of yield curve risk by hedging US Treasury bond portfolios through note/bond futures. The last article deals with the problem of immunization of a portfolio of corporate bonds. We test here alternative strategies for hedging a portfolio composed from BBB-rated corporate bonds.

40|$|The local {{theory for}} regular and multi-regular systems was {{developed}} in the assumption that these systems are Delone sets, or (r;R) -systems. The requirement for a set to be a (r;R) -system particularly implies that any two points in a Delone set can be connected by a sequence of points from the set with sequel interpoint distances bounded by 2 R. In the terminology we adopted in this paper, it means that a Delone set is a 2 R-bonded set. Meanwhile, there are crystals, e. g. zeolites, whose atomic structure is multi-regular microporous point set. In these structures there are cavities that are relatively large compared to the "length"of bonds between atomes. In other words, the parameter R in this Delone set significantly exceeds a natural link parameter. For a better description of such "microporous"structures it is worthwhile to take into consideration a parameter that represents atomic bonds within the matter. In the paper we generalize some results of the local theory to the sets that we called <b>t-bonded</b> sets even without making an assumption that a set is a Delone set.

40|$|Since {{interest}} is prohibited in Islam, {{the government in}} an Islamic economy cannot issue interest based T-Bills, <b>T-Bonds</b> and/or obtain interest based sovereign debt. Based on the literature review, {{it is argued that}} neither Prophet Muhammad (P. B. U. H) nor the pious Caliphates (rta) levied any taxes other than Zakah. Accordingly, this study explores the sources of revenue for a government in an Islamic economy. In discussing sources of tax revenue, it is maintained that Zakah is the only tax the government in an Islamic economy can levy. Nevertheless, the government can charge service/performance based fees, duties, charges etc in providing public goods. Furthermore, the profitable operations of state owned enterprises form an important part of non-tax revenues. It is also analyzed that how the non-profitable public institutions like police and courts will be funded. This study also discusses that how the government can finance its deficit keeping in view that {{interest is}} prohibited in Islam and Zakah rates are very low and Zakah base is very narrow as per common understanding. The study also gives brief insights into how much Zakah can be collected in Pakistan. Finally, it suggests that the nominal GDP growth linked rate of return can be used to benchmark domestic and external loans including those from IMF, WB and IDA etc. ...|$|R

A widely discussed case of privatization in Kosovo is that of Post and Telecom of Kosovo (PTK). Since each company has its own value, I have focused my appraising analysis on the financial statements with a special observation on Cash Flow from Operation, as the most significant indicator on showing how company is using her physical and human recourses to generate money.
