40|$|The growing cost {{associated}} with managing increasingly complex Information Technology (IT) infrastructure {{has brought about}} a new field of research – Autonomic Computing (AC). AC systems seek to mimic the management capabilities of biological systems notably, the Autonomous Nervous System (ANS), to bend the curve {{associated with}} management cost, while also allowing these managed systems to evolve and adapt, regardless of the operational context and deployment environment. The AC field attempts to bring together a number of disparate research fields {{in order to achieve}} its objectives. For this to be possible, a way to coherently link the imports of these <b>dissimilar</b> <b>fields</b> <b>is</b> required, if these systems are to be understood, and by extension trusted. To that end, this project’s focus is on the proposal of mechanisms that will allow for proper certification of autonomic computing systems. This, if successful, will provide a consistent trust measure for these systems. Particularly, in this position paper the intelligent machine design architecture is extended and used as a basis for defining autonomic computing systems. Metrics contained in the International Standard organization (ISO) 9126 - 1998 specification, are appropriated to AC systems.

The specimens for creep testing were taken from single-V weld pads fabricated by a shielded metal arc-welding process using 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel (for similar-joint) and INCONEL 182 (for dissimilar-joint) electrodes. The weld pads were subsequently given a postweld hear treatment (PWHT) of 973 K for I hour. The microstructure and microhardness of the weld joints were evaluated in the as-welded, postweld heat-treated, and creep-tested conditions. The heat-affected zone (HAZ) of similar weld joint consisted of bainite in the coarse-prior-austenitic-grain (CPAG) region near the fusion line, followed by bainite in the fine-prior-austenitic-grain (FPAG) and intercritical regions merging with the unaffected base metal. In addition to the HAZ structures in the 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel, <b>the</b> <b>dissimilar</b> weld joint displayed a definite INCONEL/ 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo weld interface structure present either as a sharp line or as a diffuse region.

Alloy 500 and Alloy 718 base metals showed various types of phases, carbides, intermetallics and eutectics in their microstructure. The results for Alloy 500 weld metal showed severe segregation of titaniumto the interdendritic regions. The Alloy 718 weldmetal compositional analysis confirmed the substantial role of Nb in the formation of low-melting eutectic-type morphologies which can reduce the weldability. <b>The</b> microstructure of <b>dissimilar</b> weld metal with dilution level of 65 % wt. % displayed semi-developed dendritic structure. The less segregation and less formation of low-melting eutectic structures caused to less susceptibility of <b>the</b> <b>dissimilar</b> weld metal to the solidification cracking.

Dissolution of γ″-Ni 3 Nb precipitations took place in the Alloy 718 heat-affected zone leading to sharp decline of the microhardness in this region.
