5|$|In {{the summer}} of that year, the German anarchist Augustin Souchy was invited by the Castro {{government}} to survey the agrarian sector. He was not impressed with what he found, and declared in his pamphlet Testimonios sobre la Revolución Cubana that the system {{was too close to}} the Soviet model. Three days after Souchy departed Cuba, the entire print run was seized by the government, and destroyed. However, an Argentinian anarchist publisher republished the pamphlet the following December. Around the same time, the ALC, alarmed at the movement of the Castro government towards a Marxist–Leninist form of rule, issued a declaration, under the name Grupo de Sindicalistas Libertarios to prevent reaction against the ALC's membership. The document declared opposition to the centralism, authoritarian tendencies, and militarism of the new government. After a denunciation of the document by <b>the</b> <b>Secretary</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> the Partido Comunista Cubano (PCC), anarchists failed in their search for a printer who would publish a reaction to the denunciation.
