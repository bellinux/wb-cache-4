25|$|Some diseases, such as tetanus, cause disease not by {{bacterial}} growth but by bacterial {{production of a}} toxin. <b>Tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> is so lethal that humans cannot develop immunity to a natural infection, {{as the amount of}} toxin and time required to kill a person is much less than is required by the immune system to recognize the toxin and produce antibodies against it. However the <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> is easily denatured losing its ability to produce disease, but leaving it able to induce immunity to tetanus when injected into subjects. The denatured toxin is called a toxoid.|$|E
25|$|Tetanolysin serves {{no known}} benefit to C. tetani. Tetanospasmin is a neurotoxin {{that causes the}} {{clinical}} manifestations of tetanus. <b>Tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> is generated in living bacteria, and is released when the bacteria lyse, such as during spore germination or vegetative growth. A minimal amount of spore germination and vegetative cell growth are required for toxin production.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} through the highly effective tetanus vaccine, which is a <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> inactivated with formaldehyde to be immunogenic but not pathogenic. The vaccine can be formulated as simple or adsorbed tetanus vaccine, combined tetanus and killed polio vaccine, or the older (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) (DPT) vaccine. Side effects are rare, {{but if they do}} occur, include fever, pain (sometimes long lasting) at the injection site, unexplained crying in infants, and irritability in older children or adults.|$|E
50|$|Many {{neurotoxins}} {{directly affect}} SNARE complexes. Such toxins as the botulinum and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins</b> work by targeting the SNARE components. These toxins prevent proper vesicle recycling {{and result in}} poor muscle control, spasms, paralysis, and even death.|$|R
5000|$|Antitoxins to {{diphtheria}} and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins</b> {{were produced}} by Emil Adolf von Behring {{and his colleagues}} from 1890 onwards.

25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> is {{a potent}} neurotoxin. On the basis of weight, tetanospasmin {{is one of the}} most potent toxins known (based on tests {{conducted}} on mice). The estimated minimum human lethal dose is 2.5 nanograms per kilogram of body weight, or 175 nanograms in a 70kg (154lb) human. The only toxins more lethal to mice are botulinum toxin, produced by close relative Clostridium botulinum and the exotoxin produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria. It should be noted, however, that humans and other animals may react to specific toxins differently from mice, and that the overall lethality of a specific toxin likely varies between different animals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> {{initially}} binds to {{peripheral nerve}} terminals. It is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions {{until it reaches}} the central nervous system. There it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory motor nerve endings, and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis. The effect of the toxin is to block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) across the synaptic cleft, which is required to check the nervous impulse. If nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms, the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus are produced. The toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, synaptobrevinII, and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 {{antibody}} {{therapy was}} used to treat tetanus, when serum from immunized horses was injected into patients with severe tetanus {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin,</b> and prevent the dissemination of the disease. Since the 1960s, human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) has been used in the United States in unimmunized, vaccine-naive or incompletely immunized patients who have sustained wounds consistent with the development of tetanus. The administration of horse antitoxin remains the only specific pharmacologic treatment available for botulism. Antitoxin also known as heterologous hyperimmune serum is often also given prophylactically to individuals known to have ingested contaminated food. IVIG treatment was also used successfully to treat several victims of toxic shock syndrome, during the 1970s tampon scare.|$|E
5|$|Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō {{discovered}} in 1890 that diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins</b> were neutralized {{in the bloodstream}} of animals by substances they called antitoxins, which were specific for the respective toxin. Behring received the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their find in 1901. A year after the discovery, Paul Ehrlich used the term antibodies (German Antikörper) for these antitoxins.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{heavy chain}} of botulinum type A neurotoxin forms {{channels}} in planar phospholipid bilayer membranes. Channel activity {{is confined to}} the N-terminal half of this chain; the C-terminal half is inactive. Channel activity is stimulated by low pH (4. 5 – 5. 5) on the cis side (the side to which protein is added), neutral pH on the opposite (trans) side, and cis positive voltages. These findings are strikingly similar to those previously reported for analogous fragments of diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Use of the Pasteur-Chamberland filter {{led to the}} {{discovery}} that diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins,</b> among others, could still cause illness even after filtration. Identification of these toxins contributed {{to the development of}} antitoxins to treat such diseases. It was also discovered that a type of substance, initially known as a [...] "filterable virus", passed through the smallest Pasteur-Chamberland filters, and replicated itself inside living cells. The discovery that living entities smaller than bacteria existed was important in establishing the field of virology.|$|R
25|$|Neurotoxins are toxins {{that are}} {{poisonous}} or destructive to nerve tissue (causing neurotoxicity). Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue. The term {{can also be}} used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contacted, can prove neurologically toxic. Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems. Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol (drinking alcohol), manganese glutamate, nitric oxide , botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin,</b> and tetrodotoxin. Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for proper function of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at excessive concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|Some neurotoxins, such as batrachotoxin, {{are known}} to destroy {{synaptic}} vesicles. [...] The <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> damages vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP), a type of v-SNARE, while botulinum toxins damage t-SNARES and v-SNARES and thus inhibit synaptic transmission. A spider toxin called alpha-Latrotoxin binds to neurexins, damaging vesicles and causing massive release of neurotransmitters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} behind full collapse fusion {{has been}} shown to be the target of the botulinum and tetanus toxins. The botulinum toxin has protease activity which degrades the SNAP-25 protein. The SNAP-25 protein is required for vesicle fusion that releases neurotransmitters, in particular acetylcholine. Botulinum [...] toxin essentially cleaves these SNARE proteins, and in doing so, prevents synaptic vesicles from fusing with the cellular synaptic membrane and releasing their neurotransmitters. <b>Tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> follows a similar pathway, but instead attacks the protein synaptobrevin on the synaptic vesicle. In turn, these neurotoxins prevent synaptic vesicles from completing full collapse fusion. Without this mechanism in effect, muscle spasms, paralysis, and death can occur.|$|E

500|$|The {{study of}} {{antibodies}} began in 1890 when Kitasato Shibasaburō described antibody activity against diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins.</b> Kitasato put forward {{the theory of}} humoral immunity, proposing that a mediator in serum could react with a foreign antigen. His idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the side-chain theory for antibody and antigen interaction in 1897, when he hypothesized that receptors (described as [...] "side-chains") {{on the surface of}} cells could bind specifically to toxins– in a [...] "lock-and-key" [...] interaction– and that this binding reaction is the trigger for the production of antibodies. Other researchers believed that antibodies existed freely in the blood and, in 1904, Almroth Wright suggested that soluble antibodies coated bacteria to label them for phagocytosis and killing; a process that he named opsoninization.|$|R

This apparent variability in the maternofetal transfer of plasma antibodies has been shown to depend upon the class of plasma proteins to which the specific antibodies belong (6, 7) : antibodies that are 7 S y 2 -globulins pass from mother to fetus, but those antibodies that are 19 S / 1 -globulins do so much less effectively or not at all.

2500|$|According to Abram Hoffer, orthomolecular {{medicine}} {{does not}} purport to treat all diseases, {{nor is it}} [...] "a replacement for standard treatment. A proportion of patients will require orthodox treatment, a proportion will do much better on orthomolecular treatment, and the rest will need a skillful blend of both." [...] Nevertheless, advocates have said that nutrients can prevent, treat, and sometimes cure {{a wide range of}} medical conditions, including: acne, alcoholism, allergies, arthritis, autism, bee stings, bipolar disorder, burns, cancer, the common cold, depression, drug addiction, drug overdose, epilepsy, heart diseases, heavy metal toxicity, acute hepatitis, herpes, hyperactivity, hypertension, hypoglycemia, influenza, learning disabilities, mental and metabolic disorders, migraine, mononucleosis, mushroom poisoning, neuropathy & polyneuritis (including multiple sclerosis), osteoporosis, polio, an hypothesised condition called [...] "pyroluria", radiation sickness, Raynaud's disease, mental retardation, schizophrenia, shock, skin problems, snakebite, spider bite, <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> and viral pneumonia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} tetanus are caused when <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin</b> blocks inhibitory impulses, by {{interfering with the}} release of neurotransmitters, including glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. These inhibitory neurotransmitters inhibit the alpha motor neurons. With diminished inhibition, the resting firing rate of the alpha motor neuron increases, producing rigidity, unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Characteristic features are risus sardonicus (a rigid smile), trismus (commonly known as [...] "lock-jaw"), and opisthotonus (rigid, arched back). Seizures may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be affected. Tetanospasmin appears to prevent the release of neurotransmitters by selectively cleaving a component of synaptic vesicles called synaptobrevin II. Loss of inhibition also affects preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the lateral gray matter of the spinal cord and produces sympathetic hyperactivity and high circulating catecholamine levels. Hypertension and tachycardia alternating with hypotension and bradycardia may develop.|$|E
2500|$|Ricin {{is several}} orders of {{magnitude}} less toxic than botulinum or <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxin,</b> but the latter are harder to come by. Compared to botulinum or anthrax as biological weapons or chemical weapons, the quantity of ricin required to achieve LD50 over a large geographic area is significantly more than an agent such as anthrax (tons of ricin vs. only kilogram quantities of anthrax). Ricin is easy to produce, but is not as practical or likely to cause as many casualties as other agents. Ricin is easily denatured by temperatures over 80°C [...] (175°F) meaning many methods of deploying ricin would generate enough heat to denature it. Once deployed, an area contaminated with ricin remains dangerous until the bonds between chain A or B have been broken, a process that takes two or three days. In contrast, anthrax spores may remain lethal for decades. Jan van Aken, a German expert on biological weapons, explained in a report for The Sunshine Project that Al Qaeda's experiments with ricin suggest their inability to produce botulinum or anthrax.|$|E

40|$|Eukaryotic {{cells secrete}} {{extracellular}} vesicles (EVs), either constitutively or in a regulated manner, which represent an important mode of intercellular communication.

We have herein demonstrated that eukaryotic EVs represent an additional route of cell-to-cell propagation for the Escherichia coli protein toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF 1). Our results prove that EVs from CNF 1 pre-infected epithelial cells can induce cytoskeleton changes, Rac 1 and NF-κB activation comparable to that triggered by CNF 1. The observation that the toxin is detectable inside EVs derived from CNF 1 -intoxicated cells strongly supports the hypothesis that extracellular vesicles can offer to the toxin a novel route to travel from cell to cell.

This stimulation was dependent on IF dose. The effect of IF on DT action was strictly species specific, indicating {{that it was not a}} consequence of the mere binding of IF to the cell membrane, but rather reflected the cellular changes that followed this initial binding. IF was found to be capable of potentiating intact DT, but could not potentiate its fragments in any combination.

40|$|The {{detection}} and sensing of biological warfare agents (Ricin, Anthrax toxin), of disease agents (cholera, botulinum and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxins,</b> influenza virus etc) and of biologically active species {{is important for}} national security and disease control. A premiere goal would be the simple colorimetric or fluorimetric detection of such toxins by a dipstick test. It would be desirable to sense 5, 000 - 10, 000 toxin molecules, i. e. 10 - 100 fg of a toxin contained 1 - 5 mL of sample. Fluorescent conjugated polymers should be particularly interesting in this regard, because they can carry multiple identical and/or different recognition units.

The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|R
