5|$|A simple {{frequency}} allocation {{problem can be}} specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters <b>that</b> <b>are</b> geographically close should use channels with frequencies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define 'geographically close' and 'far apart', then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters G, with edges between pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> geographically close, to the graph of channels H, with edges between channels <b>that</b> <b>are</b> far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not close but could interfere because of geographical features can added {{to the edges of}} G. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of H.|$|E
