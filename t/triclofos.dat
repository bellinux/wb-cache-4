50|$|<b>Triclofos</b> is a prodrug {{which is}} metabolised {{in the liver}} into the active drug trichloroethanol. This delayed action means that the {{half-life}} of <b>triclofos</b> is fairly long and it may cause drowsiness the next day. Trichloroethanol may cause liver damage and <b>triclofos</b> {{should not be used}} for extended periods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Triclofos</b> is a {{sedative}} drug used rarely {{for treating}} insomnia, usually as a second-line treatment after other drugs have failed. <b>Triclofos</b> may cause dependence {{and should not}} be withdrawn suddenly. This drug should only be used for the short term relief of severe insomnia {{and should not be}} mixed with alcohol or other depressant drugs. Patients should not drive or use machinery after taking <b>triclofos.</b>|$|E

In humans, its pharmacological effects {{are similar to}} those of its prodrugs, chloral hydrate and chlorobutanol. It has, historically, been used as a sedative hypnotic. The hypnotic drug <b>triclofos</b> (2,2,2-trichloroethyl phosphate) is metabolized in vivo to 2,2,2-trichloroethanol. Chronic exposure may result in kidney and liver damage.|$|E
40|$|Background: Search for {{an ideal}} premedicant drug for {{children}} is still on. A prospective, randomized trial {{was conducted to}} compare the efficacy of midazolam, <b>triclofos</b> and hydroxyzine as premedication in children undergoing lower abdominal surgeries. Materials and Methods: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists I or II patients 2 - 8 years of age, scheduled for elective lower abdominal surgery were included. The patients were randomly divided into three groups M, T and H of 20 children each who received midazolam 0. 5 mg/kg, <b>triclofos</b> 75 mg/kg and hydroxyzine 0. 5 mg/kg respectively, orally 60 min before surgery. The acceptability of drugs, level of sedation, anxiety during separation and on mask application was assessed. Results: The acceptability of midazolam and hydroxyzine was better than <b>triclofos.</b> Hydroxyzine {{was found to have}} lesser sedative effect as compared to both midazolam and <b>triclofos.</b> No major adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: Midazolam was found to be a better premedicant in terms of sedation, anxiolysis and safety...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{perioperative}} behavioural studies {{demonstrate that}} children {{are at greater risk}} of experiencing turbulent anaesthetic induction and adverse behavioural sequelae. We aimed to compare the efficacy of midazolam 0. 5 mg/kg with <b>triclofos</b> sodium 100 mg/kg as oral premedication in children undergoing elective surgery. Methods: In this prospective, randomised and double-blind study, sixty children posted for elective lower abdominal surgery were enrolled. The patients were randomly divided into midazolam group (Group M) and <b>triclofos</b> sodium group (Group T) of thirty each. Group M received oral midazolam 0. 5 mg/kg 30 min before induction, and Group T received oral <b>triclofos</b> sodium 100 mg/kg 60 min before induction. All children were evaluated for level of sedation after premedication, behaviour at the time of separation from parents and at the time of mask placement for induction of anaesthesia. Mann–Whitney U-test was used for comparing the grade of sedation, ease of separation and acceptance of face mask. Results: Oral midazolam produced adequate sedation in children after premedication in comparison to oral <b>triclofos</b> (P = 0. 002). Both drugs produced successful separation from parents, and the children were very cooperative during induction. No adverse effects attributable to the premedicants were seen. Conclusions: Oral midazolam is superior to <b>triclofos</b> sodium as a sedative anxiolytic in paediatric population...|$|E
40|$|Background: Conscious {{sedation}} {{is used in}} {{the pediatric}} dentistry to reduce fear and anxiety in children and promote favorable treatment outcomes. To achieve them, the primary clinical need is for a well-tolerated, effective, and expedient analgesic and sedative agent that is safe to use. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of nitrous oxide-oxygen and <b>triclofos</b> sodium as conscious sedative agents in 5 – 10 -year-old children. Methodology: Sixty children aged 5 – 10 years showing anxious, uncooperative, and apprehensive behavior were randomly divided and assigned into two groups (Groups A and B) such that Group A received 40 % nitrous oxide- 60 % oxygen and Group B received <b>triclofos</b> sodium in the dose of 70 mg/kg body weight, given 30 min before the treatment procedure. During the whole course of sedation procedure, the response of the child was assessed using Houpt's behavior rating scale. The acceptance of route of drug administration by the patient and parent was also assessed. Data obtained were statistically evaluated using the Mann–Whitney U-test and Chi-square test. Results: Children sedated with <b>triclofos</b> sodium were significantly more drowsy and disoriented compared to those sedated with nitrous oxide. The overall behavior of children in both the groups was similar. Good parental acceptance was observed for both the routes of administration. Patients accepted the oral route significantly better than inhalation route. Conclusion: Both nitrous oxide-oxygen and <b>triclofos</b> sodium were observed to be effective sedative agents, for successful and safe use in 5 – 10 -year-old dental patients. Patients showed a good acceptance of the oral route compared to the inhalation route for sedation...|$|E
30|$|On {{completion}} of the ultrafast MRI examination, all infants were administered <b>triclofos</b> syrup (20 – 80  mg/kg body weight) and/or chloral hydrate (30 – 50  mg/kg body weight) for the second conventional MRI scan. We then employed the multiple-echo data image combination (MEDIC) sequence with and without fat-saturation [14] and double-echo steady-state (DESS) pulse sequence. The scanning times were 1 : 54, 2 : 47 and 1 : 48, respectively.|$|E
40|$|In 87 {{children}} aged 2 - 9 yr, oral droperidol and oral droperidol plus diazepam were compared as premedicants {{in a controlled}} double-blind clinical trial. Atropine was given orally to all the patients. Droperidol was well absorbed and produced good sedation, associated with a low incidence of vomiting after operation. Droperidol plus diazepam {{did not appear to}} offer any advantage over droperidol alone. Anxiety and extrapyramidal effects were not observed and may have been obviated by the addition of atropine. Droperidol syrup was noted to be more palatable than other oral premedicants in use. Although premedication with droperidol (Droleptan) i. m. has been used extensively, comparatively little is known of its efficacy when given orally. A previous trial of oral <b>triclofos</b> (trichloroethyl phosphate) and diazepam (Valium) in this hospital (Boyd and Manford, 1973) showed a high incidence of vomiting after operation. Trimeprazine (Vallergan) has been noted to cause prolonged recovery and drowsiness after anaesthesia and diazepam has a poor anti-salivary action. Both <b>triclofos</b> and trimeprazine may be unpalatable to children; the former because it is too sweet and the latter because of its bitter taste. Therefore, the sedative, anti-emetic and anti-salivary actions of droperidol were thought to merit a trial of the drug as an oral premedicant in children. At the same time it was decided to combine droperidol with diazepam to determine if the two drugs together would be superior to droperidol alone, particularly with regard to possible extrapyramidal symptoms and anxiety. It was intended to compare {{the results of this study}} with the results of the trial of oral <b>triclofos</b> and diazepam carried out in this hospital 3 years previously. METHOD The double-bund trial was restricted to {{children aged}} from 2 to 9 yr and weighing less than 29 kg. The majority of the patients were undergoing otolaryngological procedures, but some were under-going minor orthopaedic and general surgical operations...|$|E
40|$|Since many Dental {{interventions}} are stressful for patients, using premedications specially for younger patients {{in order to}} decrease their stress and anxiety is recommended. Premedication can also lessen patients' fears and soothe both patient and practitioner. This {{will lead to a}} better treatment in a shorter time. Prior to premedication, medical history should be obtained completely and an oral, inhalation or iv method of premedication is chosen according to sex, weight and the degree of anxiety of patients.   NO 2 is very safe method for premedication. Also, <b>Triclofos,</b> Hydroxyzin or Diazepam are other common drugs used for young patients. It should be taken into consideration that premedication cannot eliminate all the fears and anxiety and dentist should use other techniques of controlling fear as well...|$|E
40|$|A {{trial to}} compare a {{hypnotic}} (<b>triclofos)</b> with a tranquillizer (diazepam) as oral pre-medication {{was carried out}} on 200 children aged 2 - 9 years undergoing e. n. t. surgery. Atropine was added in all cases. Both drugs produced results as satisfactory as those reported in similar trials. Tridofos was better than diazepam if demeanour in the anaes-thetic room, response to induction, and reflex responses are considered together, and it also had a better antisalivary effect. In the postoperative period both drugs were equally satisfactory in regard to freedom from drug-induced pallor or restlessness. The objective of this trial {{was to assess the}} relative merits of a hypnotic and a tranquillizing drug, given by mouth, for premedication in children before minor e. n. t. surgery. Tridofos had been used in this hospital since 1962 and had seemed satisfactory, so it was dedded to compare it with the tranquillizer, diazepam. METHO...|$|E
30|$|Before the operation, {{the patient}} was fasted for 6  h with {{intravenous}} hydration. <b>Triclofos</b> sodium (1  g) was given orally for anesthetic premedication. Equipment was prepared for a difficult intubation, and two anesthesiologists {{were present in the}} operation room. When {{the patient was}} brought to the operating theater, pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and noninvasive blood pressure monitoring were established. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam (1  mg) and fentanyl (10  μg). Mask ventilation was successful. Rocuronium (6  mg) was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Direct laryngoscopy was impossible because of the patient’s limited mouth opening. The vocal cords were easily visualized by using an MVS handle with a stylet scope outer diameter (O.D.) 2.5  mm (Additional file 1 : Video S 1). The device was borrowed from MPI. A 4.0 -mm cuffed tracheal tube was inserted, and the cuff inflated to a pressure of 20  cm H 2 O. Anesthesia was maintained by intravenously administering propofol (8 – 10  mg/kg/h) and remifentanil (0.2 – 0.5  μg/kg/min) and intermittent doses of rocuronium and fentanyl. At the end of the procedure, residual neuromuscular block was antagonized with sugammadex (18  mg). For postoperative analgesia, 0.2 % ropivacaine (3  mL) was infiltrated locally. Tracheal extubation was performed after the patient resumed spontaneous breathing. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 2.|$|E
40|$|Objective: oral {{sedation}} is {{the simplest}} and most convenient sedation method for managing uncooperative child patients because {{it is easy to}} administer and {{there is no need for}} nasal hood or injection. Oral midazolam is the most commonly used preanesthetic medication for children. When given in amounts between 0. 5 and 0. 75 mg/kg of body weight, oral midazolam has been found to be an effective sedative agent for pediatric outpatients. Tramadol is a synthetic, centrally acting analgesic indicated for moderate to severe pain. Chloral hydrate is one of the sedatives most commonly used, has excellent absorption, fast induction, and exert minimal effects on respiration. zolpidem is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic due to its clinical efficacy, safety, and ability to be well tolerated with patients. Materials and Methods: 60 anxious and fearful children who reported to the department were treated under conscious sedation for the accomplishment of dental treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups. Statistical analysis was done using Kruskal Wallis Test and decision criterion was to reject the null hypothesis if the P-value is less than 0. 05. Results: it was observed that there is a statistically significant difference in median scores recorded for the level of sedation between the different groups (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: this study concluded that midazolam is the best drug for producing conscious sedation followed by tramadol and <b>triclofos.</b> Zolpidem was not able to produce a sufficient level of sedation and it cannot be supported as a sedative agent at the present dosage...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{performance}} of a pediatric sedation team working according to a specific protocol and to assess parental satisfaction with the service. Study design A descriptive observational study of all procedures performed by the sedation team (comprising sedation-trained pediatric intensive care nurses and dedicated anesthesiologists) in a university hospital over 6 years. Data collected included demographics, procedure and location, sedation staff present, sedation failure, drugs used, requirements for escalation of sedation, complications, and parental satisfaction. Results Sedation was provided for 8760 procedures in 5554 children. The sedation nurse started 1769 (20 %) procedures using <b>triclofos</b> sodium and required the assistance of the anesthesiologist in 115 (6. 5 %) cases. The remaining 6991 (80 %) cases were performed by the anesthesiologist, predominantly using propofol (in 72. 5 % of cases). No cases were deferred as a result of insufficient sedation. Adverse events were recorded in 153 (1. 7 %) children. Of these, 132 (86 %) were mild decreases in oxygen saturation. Three children were not discharged as a result of oversedation. Feedback indicated that 95 % of parents were very satisfied with the sedation service. Conclusion A dedicated sedation team using a written protocol provides a service with minimal case cancellation, zero sedation failure, very good safety, and excellent parental satisfaction. (J Pediatr 2004; 145 : 47 - 52) Providing sedation/anesthesia techniques during {{the performance of}} diagnostic andtherapeutic procedures on children decreases anxiety, discomfort, and pain and mayimprove child well being.
