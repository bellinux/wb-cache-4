25|$|Many Democrats support {{fair trade}} {{policies}} {{when it comes}} to the issue of international trade agreements, and some in the party have started supporting free trade in recent decades. In the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> a number of prominent Democrats pushed through a number of agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since then, the party's shift away from free trade became evident in the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) vote, with 15 House Democrats voting for the agreement and 187 voting against.|$|E
25|$|The crisis led to {{questioning}} of the business model of the investment bank without the regulation imposed on it by Glass–Steagall. Once Robert Rubin, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, became part of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> deregulated banks, the previous conservatism of underwriting established companies and seeking long-term gains was replaced by lower standards and short-term profit. Formerly, the guidelines said {{that in order to}} take a company public, it had to be in business for a minimum of five years and it had to show profitability for three consecutive years. After deregulation, those standards were gone, but small investors did not grasp the full impact of the change.|$|E
25|$|Also in February 1993, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, {{along with}} several other groups, {{filed a lawsuit against}} Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala over closed-door {{meetings}} related to the health care plan.

Lamberth found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> Clinton aide Ira Magaziner in his ruling. Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned in 1999 the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith.|$|E

25|$|Stiglitz wrote {{a series}} of papers and held {{a series of}} {{conferences}} explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>and</b> former chief economist at the World Bank, Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries didn't have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Indian Prime Minister, he {{authorised}} {{nuclear weapons}} testing at Pokhran. The United States strongly condemned this testing, promised sanctions, and voted {{in favour of}} a United Nations Security Council Resolution condemning the tests. President Bill Clinton imposed economic sanctions on India, including cutting off all military and economic aid, freezing loans by American banks to state-owned Indian companies, prohibiting loans to the Indian government for all except food purchases, prohibiting American aerospace technology and uranium exports to India, and requiring the US to oppose all loan requests by India to international lending agencies. However, these sanctions proved ineffective - India was experiencing a strong economic rise, and its trade with the US only constituted {{a small portion of}} its GDP. Only Japan joined the US in imposing direct sanctions, while most other nations continued to trade with India. The sanctions were soon lifted. Afterward, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> Prime Minister Vajpayee exchanged representatives to help rebuild relations.|$|E

500|$|The Daley {{administration}} has been a proponent of the Joffrey Ballet having a permanent Theatre District home {{in order to establish}} it as a major Chicago institution. [...] However, the cost of building their own building at State and Lake was prohibitive. [...] Supposedly, the city of Chicago held the development of this project hostage until the developer agreed to the Joffrey initiative. [...] The delay tactic used was to delay closing long enough to cause the developer to have to file suit. William Daley, a co-chairman of the Joffrey board of trustees, is a former Cabinet member in <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> clout-heavy brother of Chicago's former mayor, Richard M. Daley. The arts-loving mayor has revitalized the Loop in part by re-establishing a central theatre district.

500|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but responded by saying that, [...] "Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee" [...] and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus {{was not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. [...] In that year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the [...] "25 Most Influential People in America". [...] McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. [...] The industry spent some $40–50million in national advertising in response; while McCain's bill had the support of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>and</b> many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain. [...] During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning soft money, it sought to restrict [...] "issue ads" [...] run by independent groups within 60 days of an election. While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.|$|E

2500|$|Hall {{described}} himself as [...] "an old-time conservative Democrat." [...] For many years, {{he was one of}} the most conservative Democrats in the House.

40|$|Although both {{constitutional}} {{theory and}} practical considerations offer powerful reasons for Congress and the President to prefer negotiation rather than litigation {{of separation of}} powers disputes, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Administration</b> litigated <b>and</b> lost several important cases dealing with presidential power.
