50|$|The {{tricuspid valve}} can be {{affected}} by rheumatic fever, which can cause <b>tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis</b> or tricuspid insufficiency (also called tricuspid regurgitation).

40|$|Two-dimensional {{echocardiography}} {{has proved}} to be reliable in the diagnosis of mitral, aortic and pulmonary stenosis. Its role in the diagnosis of rheumatic <b>tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis</b> is still being defined; therefore, the tricuspid valve echograms of 147 patients with rheumatic heart disease were examined. Thirty-eight of these patients also underwent hemodynamic evaluation. <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis</b> was defined echocardiographically as diastolic anterior leaflet doming, thickening and restricted excursion of the other two tricuspid leaflets and decreased separation of the leaflet tips. Using these criteria, the sensitivity and specificity of the echocardiogram In detecting <b>tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis</b> were 69 and 96 %, respectively, in the group of 38 patients who had both echocardiographic and hemodynamic evaluations. However, when the smaller group of 17 patients who had simultaneous right atrial and right ventricular pressure recordings were considered separately, there was complete agreement between the echocardiographic and hemodynamic data. Thus, the two-dimensional echocardiogram is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing rheumatic <b>tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis.</b> In addition, these data provided an opportunity to determine the prevalence of <b>tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis</b> in this group of patients with chronic rheumatic valvular disease. <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>stenosis</b> was present in 14 (9. 5 %) of the total group of 147 patients who had two-dimensional echocardiograms, and in 10 (26. 3 %) of the 38 who had both echocardiographic and hemodynamic studies.

After dilatation to 27. 5 mm, the pressure drop across the valve was reduced from 12 to 5 mm Hg.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{bicuspid}} aorta {{is thought}} to have a higher risk of progressive dilation after aortic valve replacement with a subsequently increased risk of adverse aortic events. Our aim was to compare the risk of late aortic events after isolated aortic valve replacement surgery for bicuspid versus <b>tricuspid</b> aortic valve <b>stenosis</b> with concomitant mild to moderate dilatation of the proximal aorta. MethodsA total of 325 consecutive patients (60 % males; mean age, 59. 5 ± 10 years) with aortic valve stenosis and concomitant ascending aortic dilatation of 40 to 50 mm underwent isolated aortic valve replacement from 1995 through 2000. A total of 153 patients (47 %) were diagnosed with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (bicuspid aortic valve group), whereas the remaining 172 patients (53 %) had <b>tricuspid</b> aortic valve <b>stenosis</b> (<b>tricuspid</b> aortic valve group). Follow-up (3566 patient-years) was 100 % complete. Adverse aortic events were defined as the need for proximal aortic surgery or the occurrence of aortic dissection/rupture or sudden death during follow-up. ResultsOverall survival was 78 ± 4 % in the bicuspid aortic valve group versus 55 ± 6 % in the tricuspid aortic valve group (P = . 006) at 15 years postoperatively, but age-adjusted survival was not significantly different between groups (P = . 4). A total of 5 patients (3 %) in the bicuspid aortic valve group versus 9 patients (5 %) in the tricuspid aortic valve group underwent proximal aortic surgery during follow-up. Aortic dissection occurred in 3 patients in the tricuspid aortic valve group and in no bicuspid aortic valve patients. Fifteen-year freedom from adverse aortic events was 93 ± 3 % in the bicuspid aortic valve group versus 82 ± 6 % in the tricuspid aortic valve group (P = . 2).

50|$|Regurgitation {{occurs when}} a valve becomes {{insufficient}} and malfunctions, allowing some blood to flow in the wrong direction. This insufficiency can affect any of the valves as in aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, pulmonary insufficiency and tricuspid insufficiency. The other form of valvular heart disease is stenosis, a narrowing of the valve. This {{is a result of}} the valve becoming thickened and any of the heart valves can be affected, as in mitral valve <b>stenosis,</b> <b>tricuspid</b> valve <b>stenosis,</b> pulmonary valve stenosis and aortic valve stenosis. Stenosis of the mitral valve is a common complication of rheumatic fever. Inflammation of the valves can be caused by infective endocarditis , usually a bacterial infection but can sometimes be caused by other organisms. Bacteria can more readily attach to damaged valves. Another type of endocarditis which doesn't provoke an inflammatory response, is nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. This is commonly found on previously undamaged valves. A major valvular heart disease is mitral valve prolapse, which is a weakening of connective tissue called myxomatous degeneration of the valve. This sees the displacement of a thickened mitral valve cusp into the left atrium during systole.|$|R
