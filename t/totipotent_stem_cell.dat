30|$|In {{previous}} reports, pathologists {{have proposed}} two pathogeneses for HCS. One theory, supported by IHC, holds that HCSs develop from multipotent progenitor or stem {{cells of the}} liver. This theory indicates dual differentiation by an immature malignant cell and shows that combination tumors may originate from single <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell,</b> which differentiates in separate epithelial and mesenchymal directions [33]. The alternative theory, {{which is based on}} observation of transitional zones, posits that conventional tumor cells transform or dedifferentiate into sarcomatous components from hepatocellular or cholangiocellular carcinoma.

40|$|<b>Totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to differentiate into every cell type. Renewal of <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the germline and cellular differentiation during early embryogenesis rely upon posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. The Caenorhabditis elegans RNA binding protein, MEX- 3, {{plays a key role in}} both processes. MEX- 3 is a maternally-supplied factor that controls the RNA metabolism of transcripts encoding critical cell fate determinants. However, the nucleotide sequence specificity and requirements of MEX- 3 mRNA recognition remain unclear. Only a few candidate regulatory targets have been identified, and the full extent of the network of MEX- 3 targets is not known. Here, we define the consensus sequence required for MEX- 3 RNA recognition and demonstrate that this element is required for MEX- 3 dependent regulation of gene expression in live worms.

40|$|Abstract__ The work {{discussed}} in this thesis explains {{the role of the}} functional genome in germ cell tumor (GCT) pathogenesis by applying newly developed and existing computational methods to (genome-wide) functional genomic datasets. Specifically, epigenetic and (post-) transcriptional regulation in GCTs was studied to gain a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis, also aiming at clinical application of the findings. GCTs are a unique class of neoplasms originating from (fetal) developing germ cells. Five subtypes can be distinguished (I-V), which are related to physiological germ cell development. Type I GCTs, also called infantile or pediatric GCTs, are rare and generally benign. Type II GCTs, also called germ cell cancer (GCC), include a heterogeneous set of histological subtypes with clearly defined <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> components.

We propose to extend the plant stem cell concept to include single embryogenic cells as a <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> based on their capacity to regenerate or develop into an embryo under certain conditions.

40|$|Mammalian embryos at the {{blastocyst}} stage {{have three}} major lineages, which in culture can {{give rise to}} embryonic stem (ES) cells from the inner cell mass or epiblast, trophoblast stem cells from the trophectoderm, and primitive endoderm stem cells.

Sharing a likely <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> system, many other flatworm taxa are capable of regeneration as well. In this paper, we present the regeneration capacity of Macrostomum lignano, {{a representative of the}} Macrostomorpha, the basal-most taxon of rhabditophoran flatworms {{and one of the most}} basal extant bilaterian protostomes. Amputated or incised transversally, obliquely, and longitudinally at various cutting levels, M. lignano is able to regenerate the anterior-most body part (the rostrum) and any part posterior of the pharynx, but cannot regenerate a head. Repeated regeneration was observed for 29 successive amputations over a period of almost 12  months. Besides adults, also first-day hatchlings and older juveniles were shown to regenerate after transversal cutting. The minimum number of cells required for regeneration in adults (with a total of 25, 000 cells) is 4, 000, including 160 neoblasts. In hatchlings only 1, 500 cells, including 50 neoblasts, are needed for regeneration. The life span of untreated M. lignano was determined to be about 10  months...|$|E

Four weeks later LTC cells were harvested and injected into lethally irradiated female recipients either alone or together with 2 x 10 (5) female marrow cells with selectively compromised long-term repopulating potential to assay for totipotent and competitive repopulating units (CRU), respectively. A total of 46 unique clones were detected in recipients 5 wk to 7 mo after transplant. Half of these clones (22 of 46) included both lymphoid and myeloid progeny. Eight of the 22 lympho-myeloid clones were represented in multiple recipients, in some cases after injection of limiting numbers of CRU, thus indicating repopulation from sibling <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> generated during the initial 4 -wk period in LTC. Serial analysis of cells released into the nonadherent fraction of LTC for up to 7 wk provided additional evidence of the continuing proliferation in LTC of <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> with long-term repopulating potential. The frequency of CRU determined from limiting-dilution analyses of LTC-derived cells was the same for recipients analyzed at 5 wk or 7 mo after transplantation and was also the same whether marrow or thymus repopulation was assessed. These assays showed that concurrent with the expansion of some totipotent cells revealed by retroviral marking, there was a slow but net 6. 5 -fold decrease in total CRU numbers after 4 wk in LTC. These results show the capacity of some <b>totipotent</b> hematopoietic <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to be maintained and amplified over extensive time periods in vitro without diminution of their long-term in vivo repopulating potential.

Pluripotent stem cells show remarkable similarities to the pluripotent cells of the early embryo and the stem cells of one particularly well studied teratocarcinoma, the OTT 6050 tumor established by Stevens (7), {{have been shown to}} be totipotent because single stem cells from this tumor have been injected into blastocysts of mice and the offspring derived from injected blastocysts {{have been shown to be}} mosaic in most, if not all, tissues, including the germ line (8).

The author herein reports {{a case of}} esophageal carcinoma with triplicate differentiation (squamous cell carcinoma, small cell car-cinoma, and adenocarcinoma). A 78 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of dysphagia. An endoscopic examination revealed a polypoid tumor (3 x 4 x 3 cm) in the distal esophagus, and biopsy was obtained. The biopsy showed a tumor composed of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, small cell car-cinoma, and adenocarcinoma. The proportions of them were 40 % in squamous cell carcinoma component, 50 % in small cell carci-noma component, and 10 % in adenocarcinoma. There were gradual merges among them. Immunohistochemically, squamous cell car-cinoma component was positive for cytokeratins and p 53 protein. The Ki- 67 labeling was 43 %.

40|$|Immune {{privilege}} provides {{protection to}} vital tissues or {{cells of the}} body when foreign antigens are introduced into these sites. The modern concept of relative immune privilege applies {{to a variety of}} tissues and anatomical structures, including the hair follicles and mucosal surfaces. Even sites of chronic inflammation and developing tumors may acquire immune privilege by recruiting immunoregulatory effector cells. Adult stem cells are no exception. For their importance and vitality, many adult stem cell populations are believed to be immune privileged. A preimplantation-stage embryo that derives from a <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> (i. e., a fertilized oocyte) must be protected from maternal allo-rejection for successful implantation and development to occur. Embryonic stem cells, laboratory-derived cell lines of preimplantation blastocyst-origin, may, therefore, retain some of the immunological properties of the developing embryo. However, embryonic stem cells and their differentiated tissue derivatives transplanted into a recipient do not necessarily have an ability to subvert immune responses to the extent required to exploit their pluripotency for regenerative medicine. In this review, an extended definition of immune privilege is developed and the capacity of adult and embryonic stem cells to display both relative and acquired immune privilege is discussed. Furthermore, we explore how these intrinsic properties of stem cells may one day be harnessed for therapeutic gain...|$|E

5000|$|In plants, organogenesis, {{which is}} simply the process of forming new organs, occurs {{continuously}} and only stops when the plant dies. In the shoot, the shoot apical meristems regularly produce new lateral organs (leaves or flowers) and lateral branches. In the root, new lateral roots form from weakly differentiated internal tissue (e.g. the xylem-pole pericycle in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana). In vitro {{and in response to}} specific cocktails of hormones (mainly auxins and cytokinins), most plant tissues can de-differentiate and form a mass of dividing <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> called a callus.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that regulate {{the commitment of}} a <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> to the megakaryocytic lineage are largely unknown. Using a molecular approach {{to the study of}} megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production, mice in which thrombocytopoiesis could be controlled were produced by targeting the expression of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase toxigene to megakaryocytes using the regulatory region of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3. The programmed eradication of the megakaryocytic lineage was induced by treating transgenic mice bearing the hybrid construct (alpha IIbtk) with the antiherpetic drug ganciclovir (GCV). After 10 d of treatment, the platelet number was reduced by > 94. 6 %. After discontinuing GCV, the bone marrow was repopulated with megakaryocytes and the platelet count was restored within 7 d. Prolonged GCV treatment induced erythropenia in the transgenic mice. Assays of myeloid progenitor cells in vitro demonstrated that the transgene was expressed in early erythro- megakaryocytic progenitor cells. The reversibility and facility of this system provides a powerful model to determine both the critical events in megakaryocytic and erythroid lineage development and for evaluating the precise role that platelets play in the pathogenesis of a number of vascular occlusive disorders...|$|E
30|$|When {{comparing}} SUVmax {{values of}} the two tracers, we observed that the whole 18 F-FDG uptake was higher than 68 Ga-somatostatin analogs, suggesting that in our MCC population the tumor aggressiveness—as reflected by glucose avidity—seems to be a predominant characteristic. In other neuroendocrine tumors, particularly those of the gastro-entero-pancreatic tract, a positive 68 Ga-SRI (representing the expression of SSTRs) with a faint or absent 18 F-FDG uptake is typically observed in well-differentiated tumors with good prognosis, and a positive 18 F-FDG with a faint or absent 68 Ga-SRI uptake (representing the loss of SSTRs) is typically observed in more aggressive undifferentiated tumors [36, 37]. From our findings, MCC seems to deviate from this general “rule,” and shows a similar uptake pattern using both PET tracers. In support of these observations, Gardair et al. [34] argued that the expression {{of at least one}} SSTR in the majority of MCC lesions was an unexpected finding, as MCCs are poorly differentiated, highly proliferative tumors. Moreover, SSTR expression was not associated with clinical characteristics, Ki 67 proliferative index, or clinical outcome, suggesting that the expression of SSTR is not itself a favorable prognostic index in MCC, differently from other neuroendocrine tumors. To explain this peculiar functional PET behavior of MCC, we may refer to one of the postulated theories on the controversial origin of MCC cell: a <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> that acquires neuroendocrine characteristics (as SSTRs expression) during malignant transformation [38, 39].|$|E
40|$|In vertebrates, trunk {{neural crest}} (NC) generates glia, neurons, and melanocytes. In addition, it yields mesectodermal {{derivatives}} (connective tissues, chondrocytes, and myofibroblasts lining the blood vessels) in the head. Previous in vitro clonal analyses of avian NC cells unraveled a hierarchical succession of highly pluripotent, followed by various intermediate, progenitors, suggesting {{a model of}} progressive restrictions in the multiple potentialities of a <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell,</b> as prevails in the hematopoietic system. However, which progenitors are able to self-renew within {{the hierarchy of the}} NC lineages is still undetermined. Here, we explored further the stem cell properties of quail NC cells by means of in vitro serial subcloning. We identified types of multipotent and oligopotent NC progenitors that differ in their developmental repertoire, ability to self-maintain, and response to exogenous endothelin 3 according to their truncal or cephalic origin. The most striking result is that bipotent progenitors are endowed with self-renewal properties. Thus glia–melanocyte and glia–myofibroblast progenitors behave like stem cells in that they are able both to self-renew and generate a restricted progeny. In our culture conditions, glia–myofibroblast precursors display a modest capacity to self-renew, whereas glia–melanocyte precursors respond to endothelin 3 by extensive self-renewal. These findings may explain the etiology of certain multiphenotypic NC-derived tumors in humans. Moreover, the presence of multiple stem cell phenotypes along the NC-derived lineages may account for the rarity of the “totipotent NC stem cell” and {{may be related to the}} large variety and widespread dispersion of NC derivatives throughout the body...|$|E

We use in situ hybridization, antibody staining and RNA interference to study macpiwi expression and function in adults, during postembryonic development, regeneration and upon starvation. We found novelties regarding piwi function and observed differences to current piwi functions in flatworms.

A knock-down of macpiwi led to a complete elimination of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and death of the animals. Second, the regulation of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was different in adults and regenerates compared to postembryonic development. Third, sexual reproduction of M. lignano allowed to follow germline formation during postembryonic development, regeneration, and starvation. Fourth, piwi expression in hatchlings further supports an embryonic formation of the germline in M. lignano.

40|$|Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) is a 70, 000 Mr {{protein that}} has been {{isolated}} from the membrane of red cells. The function of DAF is to inhibit the assembly of amplifying enzymes of the complement cascade on the cell surface, thereby protecting them from damage by autologous complement. We raised monoclonal antibodies to DAF and used them to study its distribution in cells from the peripheral blood of normal individuals and of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a disease characterized by the unusual susceptibility of red cells to the hemolytic activity of complement. The results of immunoradiometric assays and of fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that DAF was present not only on red cells but was widely distributed on the surface membrane of platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes. By Western blotting, we observed small but consistent differences in the Mr of DAF from the membranes of various cell types. Quantitative studies showed that phagocytes and B lymphocytes, which presumably enter more frequently in contact with immune complexes and other potential activators of complement, had the highest DAF levels. As previously reported by others, the red cells from PNH patients were DAF deficient. When the patients' red cells were incubated in acidified serum (Ham test), only the DAF-deficient cells were lysed. In addition, we detected defects in DAF expression on platelets and all types of leukocytes. The observed patterns of DAF deficiency in these patients {{were consistent with the}} concept that the PNH cells were of monoclonal origin. In one patient, abnormal and normal cells were found only in the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages. In two other patients, the lymphocytes were also DAF deficient, suggesting that a mutation occurred in a <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell.</b> It appears, therefore, that the lesion leading to PNH can occur at various stages in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells...|$|E

It is often suggested {{that they are able}} to rejuvenate during fission, regeneration and starvation. These features, together with the rapidly expanding molecular toolset, make planarians such as Schmidtea polychroa and S. mediterranea interesting for ageing research. Yet, the basic demographic and physiological data are lacking or still based on fragmentary observations of one century ago. Here, we present the first longitudinal physiological study of the species S. polychroa. Survival, size and metabolic rate, measured by microcalorimetry, of a cohort of 28 individuals were followed over a period of three years. Sexual maturity was reached during the second month after which the worms continued growing up to 5 months. This initial growth phase was followed by alternating periods of synchronised growth and degrowth. Although mass-specific metabolic rates declined during the initial growth phase, no changes were found later in life. The absence of metabolic ageing may be explained by the very high rate of cell renewal during homeostasis and alternating phases of degrowth and growth during which tissues are renewed. Surprisingly, all deaths occurred in pairs of worms that were housed in the same culture recipient, suggesting that worms did not die from ageing. Taking into account the metabolic and demographic data, we suggest that S. polychroa shows negligible ageing. Detailed analyses of size and metabolic rate revealed a remarkable biphasic allometric scaling relation. During the initial growth phase (months 1 - 5) the allometric scaling exponent b was 0. 86 while later in life, it increased to an unusually large value of 1. 17, indicating that mass-specific metabolic rate increases with size in adult S. polychroa.

The F 2 analysis of 2 HA X Jemalong crosses suggest that a single gene may open the way to SE but additional genes are required to maximise the process. Auxin and cytokinin are required for 2 - 3 weeks for SE and for de novo root formation auxin is essential for about one week. Abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, both stress related hormones, enhance SE induction but inhibit callus and de novo root formation. The WUSCHEL (WUS) gene was investigated in M. truncatula (Mt) and identified by the similarity with Arabidopsis WUS in amino acid sequence, phylogeny, promoter element patterns, and expression patterns in planta. MtWUS is induced by cytokinin after 24 - 48 h in embryogenic cultures and maximum expression occurs after 1 week which coincides with <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> induction. MtWUS expression, as illustrated by promoter-GUS studies, subsequently localises to the embryo and corresponds to the onset of MtCLV 3 expression. RNAi studies show that MtWUS expression is essential for callus and somatic embryo production. There is evidence based on the presence of MtWUS promoter binding sites that MtWUS is required for the induction of MtSERF 1 which appears to have {{a key role in the}} signalling required for SE induced in 2 HA. MtWOX 5, as for MtWUS, was identified by similarity to Arabidopsis WOX 5 based on amino acid sequence, phylogeny, promoter element patterns, and expression patterns in planta. MtWOX 5 expresses in the auxin induced root primordium and root meristem and appears to be involved in pluripotent stem cell induction. GA suppresses the MtWOX 5 expression in the root apex and suppresses the root primordium induction, consistent with the importance of MtWOX 5 in in vitro root formation. The evidence is discussed that the homeotic genes MtWUS and MtWOX 5 are “hijacked for stem cell induction which is key to somatic embryo and de novo root induction. In relation to SE, a key role for WUS in the signalling involved in induction is discussed and a model developed...|$|E
40|$|Planarians are flatworms, which {{belong to}} the phylum Platyhelminthes. They have been a {{classical}} subject of study due to their amazing regenerative ability, which relies {{on the existence of}} adult <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Nowadays they are an emerging model system in the field of developmental, regenerative, and <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> biology. In this study we analyze the effect of a simulated microgravity and a hypergravity environment during the process of planarian regeneration and embryogenesis. We demonstrate that simulated microgravity by means of the random positioning machine (RPM) set at a speed of 60 [*]°/s but not at 10 [*]°/s produces the dead of planarians. Under hypergravity of 3 [*]g and 4 [*]g in a large diameter centrifuge (LDC) planarians can regenerate missing tissues, although a decrease in the proliferation rate is observed. Under 8 [*]g hypergravity small planarian fragments are not able to regenerate. Moreover, we found an effect of gravity alterations in the rate of planarian scission, which is its asexual mode of reproduction. No apparent effects of altered gravity were found during the embryonic development...|$|R

Like Athena of Greek mythology, she distills wisdom from published literature. Athena is fascinated by the tailbone (coccyx) for more than one reason: it is named poetically after the beak of a cuckoo; it is the key Darwinian link between the tail of primates and the tailless Homo sapiens; notwithstanding its tiny size it plays a vital role in anal continence by giving attachment to anal sphincters; and above all it harbors <b>totipotent</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> giving rise to a peculiar tumor - the Sacrococcygeal Teratoma (SCT). This tumor is peculiar because it is almost always benign to start with and it turns malignant with passage of time. This emphasizes the importance of early surgery and the need to excise coccyx in SCT. Athena believes that studying the natural history of SCT may unravel the secrets of oncogenesis. [...] ...|$|R

In order to ascertain if these embryonic factors could synergistically/additively interact with 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -Fu), whole cell-count, flow-cytometry analysis and apoptotic parameters were recorded in human colon cancer cells (Caco 2) treated with Zebrafish <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation stage factors (SCDSF 3 mu g/ml) in association or not with 5 -Fu in the sub-pharmacological therapeutic range (0. 01 mg/ml). Cell proliferation was significantly reduced by SCDSF, meanwhile SCDSF+ 5 -Fu leads to an almost complete growth-inhibition. SCDSF produces a significant apoptotic effect, meanwhile the association with 5 -FU leads to an enhanced additive apoptotic rate at both 24 and 72 hrs. SCDSF alone and in association with 5 -Fu trigger both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways, activating caspase- 8, - 3 and - 7. SCDSF and 5 -Fu alone exerted opposite effects on Bax and Bcl-xL proteins, meanwhile SCDSF+ 5 -Fu induced an almost complete suppression of Bcl-xL release and a dramatic increase in the Bax/Bcl-xL ratio. These data suggest that zebrafish embryo factors could improve chemotherapy efficacy by reducing anti-apoptotic proteins involved in drug-resistance processes...|$|R
