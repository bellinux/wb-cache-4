5|$|One final {{consequence}} of the raid was that the Telecommunications Research Establishment, {{where much of the}} Bruneval equipment was analysed, and British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not the target of a reprisal raid by German airborne forces.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create {{the concept of a}} story vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future.

5|$|The main {{achievement}} of Markham's RGS presidency was the revival {{at the end}} of the 19th century of British interest in Antarctic exploration, after a 50-year interval. He had strong and determined ideas about how the National Antarctic Expedition should be organised, and fought hard <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was run primarily as a naval enterprise, under Scott's command. To do this he overcame hostility and opposition from much of the scientific community. In the years following the expedition he continued to champion Scott's career, to the extent of disregarding or disparaging the achievements of other contemporary explorers.|$|E

During periods from April through June, the voltage along sections of the Lilleaker Line was raised from 600 to 750V; this included trials with the SL95 <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could operate under this current as well.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the bill in the House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the same bill that has been rejected twice.

5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone is now available in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
5|$|Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first {{announced}} plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In {{the wake of the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 1669 Morgan and his {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship {{and made his}} way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to negotiate, and threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.|$|E

Unfortunately, many numerical optimization techniques, such as hill climbing, gradient descent, some of the quasi-Newton methods, among others, are designed to find local maxima (or minima) and not saddle points. For this reason, one must either modify the formulation <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a minimization problem (for example, by extremizing {{the square of the}} gradient of the Lagrangian as below), or else use an optimization technique that finds stationary points (such as Newton's method without an extremum seeking line search) and not necessarily extrema.|$|R

5|$|The RAAF's Chinook fleet {{suffered}} two serious accidents. On 26 June 1975, A15-011 crashed {{when one}} of its engine turbines disintegrated. No. 3 Aircraft Depot was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter, {{but it did not}} reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs. On 4 February 1985, A15-001 struck power lines and crashed into Perseverance Dam near Toowoomba, Queensland, while undertaking a navigation exercise. The helicopter's pilot, an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force, was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries. The helicopter was written off and used as a fire training aid at Amberley. The court of inquiry into this incident found that the air crew were unaware of the presence of the power lines as they were not marked on the maps used to plan the flight, and were difficult to see. However, the inquiry also judged that the mission had been inadequately planned and recommended that No. 12 Squadron update the master map used for preparing operations in the Amberley region <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> included all flying hazards.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was allotted three specific tasks to achieve {{as a part}} of Tonga, apart from protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings and taking control of the areas of strategic importance to the east of Caen. First, it was to capture intact the two bridges over the Caen Canal and the Orne River at Bénouville and Ranville. The bridges then would be defended against counterattacks. Gale knew that the capture of the bridges would be critical for the resupply and reinforcement of his division, but he did not know that the bridges were incapable of supporting tanks. Second, the {{division was}} to destroy the heavily fortified Merville coastal artillery battery located at Franceville Plage, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could not shell the British forces landing in the area codenamed Sword. The third mission was to destroy several bridges which spanned the River Dives, located near the towns of Varaville, Robehomme, Bures and Troarn. The division would then hold the territory that it had seized, until it could be relieved by advancing British ground forces.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
