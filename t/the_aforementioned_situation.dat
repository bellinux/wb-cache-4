Our investigations showed that <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> <b>situations</b> can be met by appropriate changes in the field strength and the phase velocity. In this study, factors affecting the bunching of electrons have been surveyed using the equations of electron motion. The dynamics of the electron movement through the buncher has been simulated.

If the field strength is large from the beginning, the phase velocity variations will be large and rapidly reach a value of 1. In this case, the initial phase range will become small, (3) the electron gun voltage changes the initial phase; the larger the value of the gun voltage, the wider the initial phase range, and vice versa.

The main {{application of the}} study is to analyse the effects of SSI on the resonant response of bridges caused by railway traffic. As this phenomenon is highly influenced by the free vibration response of the deck, a numerical investigation is carried out by analysing the effects of the wave propagation problem on the transverse-free vibration response of beams under moving loads {{in a wide range of}} velocities. To this end, a coupled three-dimensional boundary element-finite element model formulated in the time domain is used to reproduce the soil and structural behaviour, respectively. A subset of bridges is defined considering span lengths ranging from 12. 5 to 25 m and fundamental frequencies covering associated typologies. A homogeneous soil is considered with shear wave velocities ranging from 150 to 365 m/s. From the single load-free vibration parametric analysis, conclusions are derived regarding the conditions of maximum free vibration and cancellation of the response. These conclusions are used afterwards to justify how resonant amplitudes of the bridge under the circulation of railway convoys are affected by the soil properties, leading to substantially amplified responses or to almost cancelled ones, and numerical examples are included to show <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> <b>situations.</b> Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad BIA 2013 - 43085 -...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Changes {{in protein}} {{evolutionary}} rates among lineages have been frequently observed {{during periods of}} notable phenotypic evolution. It is also known that, following gene duplication and loss, the protein evolutionary rates of genes involved in such events changed because of changes in functional constraints acting on the genes. However, {{in the evolution of}} closely related species, excluding <b>the</b> <b>aforementioned</b> <b>situations,</b> <b>the</b> frequency of changes in protein evolutionary rates is still not clear at the genome-wide level. Here we examine the constancy of protein evolutionary rates in the evolution of four closely related species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus). Results For 2, 610 unambiguously defined orthologous genes among the four species, we carried out likelihood ratio tests between constant-rate and variable-rate models and found 344 (13. 2 %) genes showing significant changes in the protein evolutionary rates in at least one lineage. Of all those genes which experienced rate changes, 139 and 49 genes showed accelerated and decelerated evolution, respectively. Most of the evolutionary rate changes could be attributed to changes in selective constraints acting on nonsynonymous sites, independently of species-specific gene duplication and loss. We estimated that the changes in protein evolutionary rates have appeared with a probability of 2. 0 × 10 - 3 per gene per million years {{in the evolution of the}} Saccharomyces species. Furthermore, we found that the genes which experienced rate acceleration have lower expression levels and weaker codon usage bias than those which experienced rate deceleration. Conclusion Changes in protein evolutionary rates possibly occur frequently in the evolution of closely related Saccharomyces species. Selection for translational accuracy and efficiency may dominantly affect the variability of protein evolutionary rates. </p...|$|R
