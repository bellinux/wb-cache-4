5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and <b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>in</b> the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, {{who had been in}} the Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the ongoing}} {{complaints}} about the difficulty of sighting <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> fog, the lighthouse was abandoned in 1897 when the North and South Lundy lighthouses were built. The Old Light and the associated keepers' houses are kept open by the Landmark Trust.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E

5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{entered the}} Army of the United States in 1941 and was {{assigned}} to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a part of the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1944, as a first lieutenant, Thompson led his men during an air raid as part of Operation Market Garden. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the jump bay of the platoon's C-47 Skytrain was later than expected, moving their landing zone from its intended location near Grave, Netherlands; the plane was passing over buildings when the paratroopers were signalled to leave the aircraft, and Thompson decided to wait until reaching several approaching fields.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E

50|$|At some intersections in Quebec, Canada, {{the yellow}} and red lights will appear {{together}} to indicate that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> {{is about to change}} to red.
