5|$|Section 4 of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1789 had {{provided}} that two judges or justices {{would constitute a}} quorum. The practice of sending a single circuit rider was explicitly authorized by <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1793, but was already common before 1793.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences.

5|$|I do not, and I have {{no doubt}} your Lordships do not, have any wish to expand the role of <b>the</b> <b>judiciary</b> {{at the expense of}} any other organ of the State or to seek to {{frustrate}} the properly expressed wish of Parliament as contained in legislation. The attribution in certain quarters of such a wish to <b>the</b> <b>judiciary</b> is misconceived and appears to be the product of lack of understanding of the judicial function and the sources of law which the courts are bound to apply.|$|E
5|$|In Marbury, the Supreme Court {{held that}} Madison's failure {{to deliver the}} {{commission}} to Marbury was illegal, but did not grant Marbury a writ of mandamus {{on the ground that}} § 13 of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1789 was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the Court to issue such writs under its original jurisdiction.

5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court {{had heard}} only two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United States v.

The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E

After More, the Marshall Court heard six appeals from the D.C. circuit court via original habeas.|$|E
