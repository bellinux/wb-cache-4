5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming <b>that</b> <b>short</b> events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E

Due to mysterious yet unspecified events, half of the Ardents crew board lifeboats and abandon ship against the captain's orders.

5|$|NY73 {{begins at}} {{a traffic light}} along NY86 near {{the eastern end of}} the village of Lake Placid in the town of North Elba. The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with Mill Pond Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For <b>that</b> <b>short</b> time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the {{possession}} resulted in a five-yard penalty against Tech. The second play resulted in the initial first down of the game as Brown completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Adams. After the first down, Williams picked up two yards on a running play, but Texas lost <b>that</b> <b>short</b> gain when Brown fumbled the ball during the next play. Brown lost seven yards, but recovered the ball. On third down, Brown attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped short {{of the line of}} scrimmage. Texas' punt was fair caught at the 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech began its second possession.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, Plante {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil—their top goaltender—had {{fractured}} his jaw. Plante played for three games, but in <b>that</b> <b>short</b> time, he generated controversy. Coach Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This brief {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of active pixel sensor, pixel and column circuit. Surprisingly, we find <b>that</b> <b>shorter</b> readout times can be achieved by reducing the bias current and hence reducing energy consumption. We investigate the effect of nonidealities on the readout operation. We find that when the follower transistor channel-length modulation is taken into consideration, delay is reduced, which implies <b>that</b> <b>shorter</b> length transistors can be used in the pixel. We show that readout time decreases linearly with technology scaling. Index Terms—Active pixel sensor (APS), CMOS image sensor, high-speed imaging, readout electronics. I...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} a complete {{analysis of the}} APS pixel and column circuit delay. Contrary to common belief, we show <b>that</b> <b>shorter</b> settling times {{can be achieved by}} reducing the bias current and hence reducing energy consumption. We then investigate the effect of non-idealities on the readout operation. We find that when the follower transistor channel length modulation is taken into consideration, delay is reduced, which implies <b>that</b> <b>shorter</b> length transistors can be used in the pixel. As expected, we find that delay decreases linearly with technology scaling. 1...|$|R
5|$|M-63 {{originally}} {{ran from}} Peacock in Lake County west through Luther to M-13 (later US131) in Osceola County on July 1, 1919. This highway was extended in 1930 along US131 to Tustin {{and then to}} a terminus with M-66 in Marion. At the same time, M-37 was extended north from Baldwin to meet M-63 east of Peacock. This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61. A short connector roadway, M-179, was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US131, forming a small triangle of highways. The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock. The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing <b>that</b> <b>short</b> highway from the state trunkline highway system. M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control.|$|E

25|$|However a short {{conductor}} {{fed with}} a RF voltage {{will not have}} a uniform current even along <b>that</b> <b>short</b> range. Rather, a short dipole in real life has a current equal to the feedpoint current at the feedpoint but falling linearly to zero over the length of <b>that</b> <b>short</b> conductor. By placing a capacitive hat, such as a metallic ball, {{at the end of the}} conductor, it is possible for its self capacitance to absorb the current from the conductor and better approximate the constant current assumed for the Hertzian dipole. But again, the Hertzian dipole is meant only as a theoretical construct for antenna analysis.|$|E
