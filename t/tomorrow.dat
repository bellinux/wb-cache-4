5|$|Life Is People is {{the fourth}} studio album by English singer, pianist and {{songwriter}} Bill Fay, released by Dead Oceans in August 2012. Fay had been without a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following the release of his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album <b>Tomorrow,</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> & <b>Tomorrow.</b> In order to support himself, Fay took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See for Miles Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and <b>Tomorrow,</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> & <b>Tomorrow</b> was finally released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of <b>Tomorrow,</b> another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 {{that it would be better}} to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of <b>Tomorrow</b> and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of <b>Tomorrow</b> was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E

5|$|<b>Tomorrow</b> Never Dies was {{the first}} of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson's version is {{expanded}} from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver's background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson's series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner's continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny when he said he had taken a course in Asian languages. <b>Tomorrow</b> Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected by <b>Tomorrow</b> Never Dies, specifically Bond's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson {{said in an interview that}} he felt <b>Tomorrow</b> Never Dies was the best of the three novelisations he wrote.|$|E
