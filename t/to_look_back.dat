25|$|Cormac Ó Gráda, {{referencing}} {{the work}} of W. A. MacArthur, writes that specialists {{have long known that}} the Irish death tables were inaccurate. As a result, Ó Gráda says that the tables undercount the number of deaths, because information was gathered from surviving householders having <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> over the previous 10 years, and death and emigration had cleared away entire families, leaving few or no survivors to answer the census questions.|$|E

25|$|However, Roddenberry himself preemptively rebuked such an attitude. He {{had hoped}} that Star Trek would go on after his death. As Star Trek was {{constantly}} improved by each following generation, he expected people <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> upon its humble beginnings as just that, the simple beginnings of something much bigger and better. Roddenberry clearly never intended Star Trek {{to be limited to}} his work, but to include all the hopefully superior work of future generations.|$|E
25|$|Painters {{continued}} to include Jane Seymour in pictures of King Henry VIII long after she died, mainly because Henry continued <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on her with favour {{as the only}} wife who gave him a son.

After Catherine Howard was executed, even the Howard family removed her picture from their family portrait gallery.|$|E

All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E

25|$|As a group, the {{students}} were {{under the influence of}} Romanian Symbolist clubs, which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco's first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue Simbolul, which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania's leading modern poets, from Alexandru Macedonski to Ion Minulescu and Adrian Maniu. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find its voice, alternating modernism with the more conventional Symbolism. Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of Simbolul, and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913). Unlike Tzara, who refused <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on Simbolul with anything but embarrassment, Janco was proud of this moment in life, depicting it as his first participation in artistic revolution.|$|E
500|$|In all {{first-class}} matches, MacLaren scored 1,037 runs at 54.57; in the Test matches, he aggregated 488 runs at {{an average}} of 54.22.

[...] At the conclusion of the tour, on 17 March 1898, he married Power. The wedding attracted media attention and was well attended. The couple later had two sons.|$|E
500|$|At some points, {{the player}} can use Athena's [...] "mood matrix" [...] {{mechanic}} to detect conflicting emotions in witnesses' voices during their testimonies, such as sudden happiness {{in the middle}} of fear. Four different emotions can show up in testimony analyses – happiness, anger, shock, and sadness (the icon of which also represents fear) – which will light up with different intensity. The player goes through the testimony, and aims to determine the cause of the conflicting emotion. Near the end of trials, when the player is close to solving the case, they can use the [...] "revisualization" [...] mechanic <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at known facts and make a series of deductions by picking the right choices, to reach a conclusion.|$|E

500|$|By time Tunis had fallen, few Rhodesians {{remained}} with the First or Eighth Armies; most were transferring to the South African 6th Armoured Division, then in Egypt, or {{making their way}} home on leave. Out of the 300 Southern Rhodesians who had joined the KRRC in Egypt, only three officers and 109 other ranks remained {{at the end of}} the Tunisian Campaign. The Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery retraced many of the movements it had taken during the campaign as it returned to Egypt. [...] "Left for Matruh at 0830 hours today," [...] one Rhodesian gunner wrote.

[...] Oxford won by 10 lengths in a time of 24 minutes 34 seconds. [...] It was their third win in four years and secured Oxford's ninth win in the event compared to Cambridge's ten. [...] Contemporary rower and author William MacMichael suggested: [...] "Of these two crews it is scarcely necessary to say more than that if they did not reach the consummate excellence of some which we have been accustomed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> upon as the highest standard of form and beauty, they were yet a good average specimen of University rowing." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, after {{finishing}} the world tour {{in support of}} their sixth studio album Hail to the Thief (2003), Radiohead went on hiatus. As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with EMI, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely {{time to take a}} break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected. And we’d {{come to the end of}} our contract, which gives you a natural point <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> over at what you've achieved as a band." [...] Singer and songwriter Thom Yorke worked on his first solo album, The Eraser (2006), and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood composed his first soundtracks, for Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007).|$|E

500|$|Affleck is pro-choice. In a 2000 interview, {{he stated}} that he {{believes}} [...] "very strongly in a woman's right to choose". In 2012, he supported the Draw the Line campaign, describing reproductive rights as [...] "fundamental". Affleck was a longtime supporter of legalizing gay marriage, saying in 2004 that he hoped <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on the marriage debate [...] "with some degree of embarrassment for how antiquated it was". Also that year, he remarked that it was [...] "outrageous and offensive" [...] to suggest members of the transgender community were not entitled to equal rights. He appeared alongside his gay cousin in a 2005 Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays print advertising campaign. Affleck filmed a public service announcement for Divided We Fail, a nonpartisan AARP campaign seeking affordable, quality healthcare for all Americans, in 2007.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 2016, {{the day of}} the album's {{physical}} release, participating record shops {{around the}} world held a promotional event, [...] "Live From a Moon Shaped Pool".

A participating shop in Istanbul closed following an attack by a gang angered by customers drinking beer and playing music during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fast. Radiohead released a statement saying: [...] "Our hearts go out to those attacked tonight ...

500|$|Other critics found {{a variety}} of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower {{parallels}} Mount Sinai, the aliens as God and Roy Neary as Moses. Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between Elijah and Roy; Elijah was taken into a [...] "chariot of fire", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>back,</b> similar to Lot's wife who looked back at Sodom {{and turned into a}} pillar of salt. Spielberg explained, [...] "I wanted to make Close Encounters a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience." ...|$|E
