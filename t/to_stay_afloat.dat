5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E
5|$|The league {{approached}} the 1996 Grey Cup in dire financial straits: the American expansion {{had been a}} failure, the 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise ceased operations {{at the conclusion of}} the regular season, and out of the eight remaining teams, seven had lost money and two required direct assistance from the league <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players' families to the championship game. The Toronto Star echoed fears spoken by fans and media across the country when it asked if the 1996 championship, won by Toronto over Edmonton, would be the final Grey Cup.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
50|$|Erma Keyes {{moved around}} for a while during her only season in the All American League, as the league shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{student needs}} to get {{comfortable}} with water: this includes kicking, bobbing, underwater exploration, front and back floating and gliding with face in the water, open eyes under water. Children learning these basic skills often will use Styrofoam kick-boards, inflatable arm-floats and other aquatic equipment <b>to</b> help <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1973-74, Iglesias {{repeated}} the feat with another Segunda División side, Hércules CF, then {{remained at the}} club's helm for a further three years, always managing <b>to</b> comfortably <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> - this included a fifth place in 1975 and a sixth in 1976; in the 1977-78 season another top level promotion befell, this time as champions with Real Zaragoza.|$|R
5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} this decline was the club's ongoing {{financial}} problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then {{on the outskirts of}} urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. <b>To</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat,</b> Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By {{the end of the decade}} the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham.|$|E
50|$|Anita Foss {{joined the}} All-American League {{after her husband}} was killed in action during World War II. Described as a scrappy hitter and good fielder, she moved around for a while, as the league shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pieper {{moved around}} for a while, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> Unfortunately, she never {{achieved}} a playoff berth to set an all-time record for the most years in the league without playing in the postseason.|$|R
50|$|Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Stone {{worked in}} the shipyards before joining the AAGPBL in 1945. She was {{selected}} {{to fill in the}} gap for Racine at shortstop and later was sent to South Bend, as the league usually shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat,</b> but she never lived up to the expectations around her.|$|R
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
5|$|In central Bristol, {{where the}} river is tidal, it is {{diverted}} from its original course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E
50|$|On another occasion, {{the artist}} swam across the Hudson River {{tied to a}} chair which was {{weighted}} with lead. Doctors at Harvard University tested Faticoni's abilities by observing him {{in a pool of}} water with a 20-pound lead weight tied <b>to</b> him. Faticoni <b>stayed</b> <b>afloat</b> for 15 hours. Doctors concluded that Faticoni's abilities were due to abnormal internal organs.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{depicted}} is {{not seen}} onstage, but exists only in Gertrude's description. Ophelia has fallen into the river from a tree overhanging it, while gathering flowers. She lies in the water singing songs, as if unaware of her danger ("incapable of her own distress"). Her clothes, trapping air, have allowed her <b>to</b> temporarily <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> ("Her clothes spread wide, / And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up."). But eventually, [...] "her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay" [...] down [...] "to muddy death." ...|$|R
50|$|Following her {{rookie season}} in 1947, Kelley {{was part of}} the {{expansion}} Chicago Colleens in 1948. She opened 1949 with the Peoria Redwings, but rejoined Pollitt on the Peaches in a moment of the season when the league shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> She played with the Peaches through 1953, her last year in the league.|$|R
25|$|Animal {{locomotion}} on {{the surface}} layer of water {{is the study of}} animal locomotion in the case of small animals that live {{on the surface}} layer of water, relying on surface tension <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} he met Erik Satie, who proved a kindred spirit in his {{experimental}} approach to composition and to naming his pieces. Both musicians were bohemians during this period, enjoying the same cafe society and struggling <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> financially.|$|E
25|$|Since American coots {{build on}} the water, their {{structures}} disintegrate easily and have short life spans. Egg and brood nests are actually elaborate rafts, and must be constantly added to in order <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> Females typically do the most work while building.|$|E
50|$|Wegman {{moved around}} for a while over a period of four years, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> She started the 1947 season with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them one year before joining the Fort Wayne Daisies (1948) and then found herself on the move again, this time to the Muskegon Lassies (1949), and then the Grand Rapids Chicks (1950).|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} American Revolutionary War the newly {{established}} United States was struggling <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> financially <b>afloat.</b> National income was desperately needed, {{and a great deal}} of this income came from import tariffs. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws, and on August 4, 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, later renamed Revenue Cutter Service in 1862. It would be the responsibility of the new Revenue-Marine to enforce the tariff and all other maritime laws.|$|R
5000|$|Ninfa Laurenzo's factory was {{in trouble}} due to {{increased}} competition and decreased profit margins. In 1973 Laurenzo opened a 10 table restaurant {{in front of her}} tortilla factory in order <b>to</b> financially <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> The restaurant, Ninfa's, became very popular and it became her core business. She did not have prior restaurant management experience. While at the restaurant, Laurenzo greeted guests, watched over the kitchen operations, and sometimes sang songs in an alto voice. Joe Pratt, a professor of business and history of the University of Houston, said [...] "In the 1980s, Ninfa became a symbol of the city's growing diversity and the opportunity for people who hadn't always had opportunities here. She is a powerful image in Houston." ...|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} {{thought in the}} event of an emergency, Titanics design would enable her <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> long enough for her {{passengers}} and crew to be transferred safely to a rescue vessel. It was never anticipated that all passengers and crew would be evacuated rapidly at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Explorer was {{commissioned}} by Lars-Eric Lindblad, the Swedish-American pioneer of exotic expedition tours, and built in 1969 at Uudenkaupungin Telakka shipyard in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The ship was built <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> with two compartments filled with water. Her original Finnish-Swedish ice class was 1C, which is relatively weak. It is not known when the ice class was uprated to 1A.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1937, the T {{sold their}} shares of the Smoky Mountain Railroad to Midwest Steel, a company that dealt in scrap iron. On April 11, 1938, {{the owners of the}} {{railroad}} applied for abandonment but the application was denied. The railroad changed ownership numerous times over years, as the line was never particularly profitable and struggled <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat</b> with as few as 300 carloads of freight being shipped out of Sevierville annually.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{qualifying}} for the MRC Tour and already becoming a popular contestant with fans for his unique style, Tag's Uncle Richard, head of Conservative Motors, a company responsible for cheap, bland and uninteresting karts, attempts to sign {{him up for}} a sponsorship deal which is quickly turned down. Halfway through the Home Tour, Tag's mother reveal that they're unable to afford the constant repairs to his kart. When the kart blows out, Tag's mother is inspired from her son's newfound popularity to reopen the paintshop as a bodyshop garage, becoming an instant hit with customers and allowing them <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> financially <b>afloat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|But Baumgartner {{moved around}} for a while, as the league shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> She started the 1950 spring {{training}} with the Kalamazoo Lassies, being traded to the South Bend Blue Sox {{at the start of}} the regular season. Then during the midseason was loaned to Kalamazoo for one month and rejoined the Blue Sox to finish the season. She hit a combined [...]176 (13-for-74) in 36 games, before staying with South Bend for the rest of her career.|$|R
5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> financially <b>afloat.</b> National income was desperately needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|R
25|$|Soon de Leyva {{realized}} {{the attack was}} producing far more harm to his galleys and frigates and hardly any on the English. Even de Leyva's flag galley had sustained heavy damage and soon it warped from the fight, {{and after a few}} hours more fighting the rest of the Spanish ships had repeated the same feat. Most of them had sustained some form of damage and some were fighting <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat,</b> while the English edging away from the coast still in convoy formation, headed West.|$|E
25|$|On {{her return}} voyage Sir William Bensley {{was part of}} a convoy of seven regular ships of the EIC and nine extra ships under Royal Navy escort. Near Mauritius on 14 March the convoy ran into a {{hurricane}} and ultimately four EIC regular ships were lost: Calcutta, Bengal, Jane Duchess of Gordon, and Lady Jane Dundas The hull of one was sighted in October but it sank before the name could be identified. Sir William Bensley had to throw 12 of her guns overboard in order <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{relatively}} small and geographically dispersed Canadian market, magazines producing long-form journalism have often struggled <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> Saturday Night, which The Walrus editor John Macfarlane formerly published, lost money continuously despite being a celebrated publication. But as Macfarlane reports, The Walruss charitable model, {{similar to that of}} Harper's, is so far sustaining it: donations covered about half of the costs of producing the magazine in 2010, with the traditional revenue streams of circulation and advertising providing the rest. This is all the more important for the magazine because its educational mandate requires that it keep a ratio of no less than 70 percent editorial content to 30 percent advertising.|$|E
50|$|Well-traveled Naomi Meier {{moved around}} for a while, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> Basically a line drive hitter and speedy base runner, she {{collected}} over 25 stolen bases in five of her eight seasons in the league. An instinctive player with good hands and a strong throwing arm, she also was capable of playing well all three outfield positions. But her best attribute may {{have been able to}} adapt and perform well for nine teams and thirteen different rosters in a span of eight years.|$|R
50|$|In 1790, federal {{legislation}} was enacted pertaining to seamen and desertion. In 1796, {{federal legislation}} regarding Seaman's Protection Certificates (also known as Protection papers) was enacted. Immediately after the Revolutionary War the brand-new United States of America was struggling <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> financially <b>afloat.</b> National income was desperately needed {{and a great}} deal of this income came from import tariffs.

25|$|Lee {{continued}} {{moving around}} for a while, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed <b>to</b> help teams <b>stay</b> <b>afloat.</b> This time she joined the expansion Peoria Redwings in 1946 and was back with a last-place team. Lee went 12–23 with a 2.74 ERA as she {{led the league in}} losses. In 1947, pitching sidearm, she began with Peoria and landed with the Grand Rapids Chicks during the midseason. She posted a combined mark of 9–11 with 29 strikeouts and a 2.24 ERA in 24 games. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, Grand Rapids lost to Rockford in five games.|$|R
