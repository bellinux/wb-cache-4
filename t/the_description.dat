5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of the heavens never appeared.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 {{molecular}} phylogenetic study clarified {{the relationships}} among the mushroom-forming species of the family. The authors demonstrated the existence of four distinct lineages of gilled mushrooms, which led to <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of Multifurca as a new genus separated from Russula and the segregation of Lactifluus from Lactarius.|$|E
50|$|Recently Hungarian {{historians and}} philologists began {{to publish a}} {{critical}} edition of <b>the</b> county <b>descriptions</b> remained in manuscripts, {{based on the results}} of a comprehensive research made by the Hungarian historian Gergely Tóth. Calculating the length of <b>the</b> <b>descriptions,</b> they find it achievable to publish all <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> left in manuscript in 10 volumes. The first volume, which contains <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> of Árva and Trencsén counties, has already been published.|$|R

50|$|A third form of incongruence {{arises when}} <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> do {{not conform to}} consensual (i.e., intersubjectively verifiable) experience, such as when <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> are faulty, incorrect, wrong, or inaccurate, and need to be {{replaced}} by more accurate descriptions, models, or theories.|$|R

40|$|The paper applies {{a limited}} {{version of the}} {{resources}} of Ontological Semantic Technology to <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> of animals in the American Heritage First Dictionary and constructs a partial ontology from them. The explicitly mentioned properties in <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> are then supplemented by common-sense knowledge that <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> assume available to their young readership, and the output is compared to the previous one. The results, albeit modest, shed some interesting light on the most similar and dissimilar pairs of animals, as described in text...|$|R
5000|$|Acting under a {{description}} {{has important implications}} for interpreting our selves. Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> under which people act constitute the kind of act and {{the kind of person that}} commits the act. By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer [...] "to show who's boss", [...] "because I have ADHD", or [...] "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which <b>description</b> best suits <b>the</b> act, but rather, how <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> under which people act depend on <b>the</b> <b>descriptions</b> available to them.|$|R

5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia {{and elsewhere in}} the Sahara, but <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon. The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of I. orientalis, and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Hodgson {{described}} a red panda {{under the name}} Ailurus ochraceus, of which Pocock concluded it represents the same type as Ailurus fulgens, since <b>the</b> <b>description</b> of the two agree very closely.

5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match <b>the</b> <b>description,</b> the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that <b>the</b> <b>description</b> was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating <b>the</b> <b>description</b> was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
