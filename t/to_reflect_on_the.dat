5|$|The play is {{sometimes}} given a historical setting, enabling audiences <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations {{have been set}} {{in the midst of}} the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov's 1956 comic adaptation, Romanoff and Juliet, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of Romeo and Juliet final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris's love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. Shakespeare's R, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was The Second City's The Second City's Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet, set in modern times.|$|E

25|$|The {{theme of}} power is also central. Thornton {{represents}} three aspects {{of power and the}} authority of the ruling class: a manufacturer respected by his peers (economic power), a magistrate (judicial power) and someone who can summon the army (political power) to quell the strike (Stoneman, 1987, pp.124–126). There is energy, power and courage in the struggle for a better life by Milton's residents. Margaret demonstrates power in her verbal jousting with Thornton, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> validity of his beliefs (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 15) and eventually change his view of workers from mere providers of labour to individuals capable of intelligent thought. When she reaches age 21 Margaret takes control of her life, resolves to live as she chooses and learns how to manage wealth inherited from Mr. Bell.|$|E

25|$|In Italy, {{the prisoners}} of war were forgotten, a fate seen in other {{countries}} too. In the United States, a Prisoner of War Medal was established, but only in 1986. Prisoners symbolised what the public {{did not wish to}} see. For the latter, they were not part of the war, did not defend their country and were living symbols of defeat. Thus, the memory of the prisoners was voluntarily buried, just as they themselves tried to forget in order to continue to live. However, they were the ones best suited <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Germans with whom they lived. The richness of their memoirs reveals analyses that are sometimes quite advanced, as is for instance the case with Jacques Rivière. For historiography, the prisoner is a hinge between two countries, who can reveal the importance of what was culturally and nationally at stake during the period.|$|E
25|$|Still, {{with all}} these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not {{encourage}} individual fasting. The community in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, {{and it was the}} duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people (Ta'an. 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the Nazir's (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice (Num. vi. 11). Rabbi Zeira would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy (Yer. Ber. ii. 5d).|$|E
25|$|In this voyage, Ming China {{would also}} {{forcibly}} settle the enmity that existed {{between it and}} Java. Java was ruled by successive Majapahit kings, who had acted defiantly towards Ming China since the Hongwu reign. During the civil war between 1401 and 1406, the King of West Java had killed 170 personnel of a Chinese embassy when they came ashore on his rival's territory at East Java. The Taizong Shilu 23 October, 1407, entry recorded that the Yongle Emperor summoned the Javanese ambassadors. It stated that he accused Java of begging for forgiveness, because Ming China was mobilizing its army to punish them. It also noted that he demanded 60,000 ounces of gold and ordered them <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situation in Annam (Vietnam), which had recently been invaded by Chinese armies. This happened after the second expedition had been ordered and probably before it had left. The Chinese received and accepted their payment and their apology. They would continue to monitor their activities during subsequent voyages.|$|E

25|$|Ironside kept a diary {{throughout}} his life, starting as a subaltern {{at the turn}} of the century, with the goal of keeping a clear recollection of what had happened during the day and allowing him <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day's events. These were written directly into bound foolscap volumes, a page or more a day, each night; {{throughout his}} life, he totalled some twelve volumes and the best part of a million words. He did not ask for these to be destroyed on his death, though their content was sometimes quite contentious, but did write a will – in 1930 – asking that they not be published. In the late 1950s, however, a former colleague persuaded him to allow extracts to be published as part of an account of the run-up to the Second World War, although he died shortly before it saw print. This was published as The Ironside Diaries: 1937–1940, edited by Colonel Roderick Macleod and Denis Kelly, in 1962; the material was selected from May 1937 to his retirement in June 1940, and published as numbered daily entries with editorial notes.|$|E

500|$|Delany's Nebula-winning {{short story}} [...] "Aye, and Gomorrah" [...] posits the {{development}} of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award-winning stories featuring gay characters, such as [...] "Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones", were to follow, all collected in Delany's short story retrospective Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories. Delany faced censorship from book distribution companies for treatment of these topics. In later works, gay themes become increasingly central to Delany's works, attracting controversy, and some blur the line between science fiction and gay pornography.|$|E

500|$|Fleder {{also asked}} for stylistic {{touches on the}} episode which were {{inconsistent}} with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red scrim lighting <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subway car to add an artistic visual touch, {{even though there was}} nothing in particular in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying [...] "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." [...] Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning {{back and forth between the}} two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on Homicide: Life on the Street are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot through the windshield again.|$|E
500|$|Mickiewicz's Crimean Sonnets (1825–26) {{and poems}} {{that he would}} later write in Rome and Lausanne, [...] Miłosz notes, have been [...] "justly ranked among the highest {{achievements}} in Polish [...]" [...] His 1830 travels in Italy likely inspired him to consider religious matters, and produced {{some of his best}} religiously-themed works, such as [...] "Arcymistrz" [...] ("The Master") and [...] "Do Marceliny Łempickiej" [...] ("To Marcelina Łempicka"). [...] He was an authority to the young insurgents of 1830–31, who expected him to participate in the fighting (the poet [...] wrote a dedicated poem urging him to do so). Yet it is likely that Mickiewicz was no longer as idealistic and supportive of military action as he had been a few years earlier, and his new works such as [...] "Do matki Polki" [...] ("To a Polish Mother", 1830), while still patriotic, also began <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tragedy of resistance. His meetings with refugees and escaping insurgents around 1831 resulted in works such as [...] "Reduta Ordona" [...] ("Ordon's Redoubt"), [...] "Nocleg" [...] ("Night Bivouac") and [...] "Śmierć pułkownika" [...] ("Death of the Colonel"). Wyka notes the irony that {{some of the most important}} literary works about the 1830 Uprising were written by Mickiewicz, who never took part in a battle or even saw a battlefield.|$|E

Much {{of the planet}} occupied Stage15, known as the DeMille stage {{in honor of the}} director's Parting of the Red Sea on the stage during filming of The Ten Commandments(1956). The space measured [...] The perceived boundaries of the scenes were extended via matte paintings created by Chris Evans, Frank Ordaz, and Michael Pangrazio. Because parts of the set had to literally collapse during the planet's destruction, the set was built [...] off the ground and featured trapdoors and pyrotechnics in the floor. The hundreds of 10,000watt lights in the rafters were covered in silk for day scenes to soften the light, and fitted with blue filters for night; dimmers eased the transition between periods. Since the doomed planet was no longer a paradise, the art director, Nimoy, Bennett and Correll considered constant changes to the colors on the scenes, but decided not to get [...] "fancy photographically". While many of the scenes appeared lit with minimal light sources such as flickering fires, Correll tried to use as much light as possible.
