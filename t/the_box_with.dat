5|$|Atlético de Kolkata had {{the first}} major {{opportunity}} {{of the second half}} when Jakub Podaný crossed the ball into <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> both Baljit Sahni and Arnal looking to head it in before David James came out to catch the ball. The Kerala Blasters soon had three chances in three minutes but could not convert any of those into goals. Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while trying to clear it. The Kerala Blasters continued to have the most chances throughout the match, which was compounded in the last minute of regulation time when Michael Chopra had his point blank range shot saved by Apoula Edel. Four minutes later, in the final minute of stoppage time, Atlético de Kolkata substitute Mohammed Rafique headed home a corner from Podaný to win the match and the championship.|$|E

Italy ultimately won the competition, defeating Chile 1–0 in the final. That summer, he and Juventus teammates Claudio Marchisio and Paolo De Ceglie were named in the squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. On 7 August 2008, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 win against Honduras in the first match of the competition where he struck the ball from outside of <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> his weaker left foot.|$|E

5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Many-minds theory {{holds that}} a {{conscious}} being who observes {{the outcome of}} a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises you to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to your various successors. But in a life-or-death case like getting into <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> Schrödinger's cat, you will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure your death. So it seems that the Many-minds Interpretation advises you to get in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> the cat, since it is certain that your only successor will emerge unharmed.

25|$|The {{play-off}} was a two-legged tie {{between the}} team finishing 2nd bottom in the Premier Division {{and the team}} finishing 2nd in the First. Murdo McLeod's Partick Thistle {{took the lead in}} the 1st leg at Firhill, but a last-minute Christian Dailly header equalised for United and the scores were level for the 2nd leg at Tannadice four days later. After attacking for most of the match, United went 1–0 down to an Ian Cameron penalty, and things looked even worse as Cameron went down in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> minutes remaining. But a second penalty wasn't given and United desperately pushed for the all important equaliser.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent the}} {{succession}} tragedy which {{he himself had}} faced, the Yongzheng Emperor {{was said to have}} ordered his third son Hongshi (an ally of Yinsi) to commit suicide.

Against Lecce in April 2007, he performed an impressive piece of skill similar to a Cruyff turn, turning the ball through a defender's legs on the wing, before retrieving it to help set up Juventus's first goal of the match. Later in the match, he scored his side's third; Camoranesi took the ball past three Lecce defenders, before hitting the ball from the edge of <b>the</b> <b>box,</b> <b>with</b> his left foot into the top corner.

25|$|In 1945, the {{specific}} heating {{effect of a}} high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set {{he was working on}} started to melt a candy bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.|$|E
25|$|Drake, {{winner of}} the 2015 MVC tourney at The Ralph {{returned}} for SIUE Homecoming. Though the Bulldogs took more shots, the Cougars fairly well dominated possession in the first half. In the 27th minute, Solawa scored his first goal as a Cougar, returning a blocked Jambga shot over the Drake keeper's head. Holding the 1–0 lead through halftime, SIUE came back out fired up, narrowly missing additional goals in the early second half. In the 74th minute, Drake got a breakaway, and Kendall-Moullin was sent off after making a potentially goal-saving hard tackle. The Bulldogs stepped up their attack after gaining the man-advantage. Flooding <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> bodies on a corner kick, Drake evened the score at 1–1 in the 77th minute. The Cougar defense held firm into the last minute of regulation time, when a Bulldog forward piled atop Dal Santo as he covered a save, and both sides went a man down for extra time. In the 94th minute, Ebbesen and Solawa traded passes before Ebbesen hit Lachlan McLean five yards out, with the Australian sophomore turning and firing {{into the top of}} the net to complete the ninth consecutive Homecoming victory since SIUE returned to Division I.|$|E

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands hanging off the bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj is sitting on top of <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.|$|E
25|$|The four-game homestand {{concluded}} with a Sunday afternoon national TV game against arch-rivals New York Red Bulls. Despite a pre-game shower during warm-ups and with inclement weather approaching, the teams kicked off on time, but the game was stopped just shy of the 8:00 mark, because a powerful storm was about to settle over RFK. After the torrential rains eased somewhat, grounds-crew tried to {{remove some of the}} bigger puddles of water and play resumed after a delay of {{about an hour and a}} quarter. Despite epically sloppy conditions, United was able to create some excellent chances to score, but their finishing was not up to the task. NYRB punished the home team's mistakes when Bradley Wright-Phillips finished off a play that opened up when Franklin whiffed on an attempted clearance due to poor footing. The visitors extended their lead in the second half on a shot by Felipe. As the team had done 2 weeks earlier, a desperate United team was able to rally to gain a home draw. First, Marcelo Sarvas scored on a penalty kick, earned by Lloyd Sam, who was playing against his old team for the first time. The tying goal was scored on a header by Patrick Mullins after Birnbaum headed a long corner kick back into <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>With</b> a mid-week trip to Montreal looming, United were clinging to the final post-season slot, holding a tiebreaker edge over Orlando City SC.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside <b>the</b> <b>box</b> <b>with</b> the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the lid of the box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the problem of set-membership {{identification}} of non-linear-in-the-parameters models. To solve this problem, this study illustrates how the Bayesian approach can be used to determine the feasible parameter set (FPS) by assuming uniform distributed estimation error and flat model prior probability distributions. The key point of the methodology is the interval evaluation of the likelihood function and the result is a set of <b>boxes</b> <b>with</b> associated credibility indices. For each <b>box,</b> <b>the</b> credibility index is in the interval (0, 1] and gives information about the amount of consistent models inside <b>the</b> <b>box.</b> <b>The</b> union of <b>the</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>with</b> credibility value equal to one provides an inner approximation of the FPS, whereas the union of all boxes provides an outer estimation. <b>The</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>with</b> credibility value smaller than one are located around the boundary of the FPS and their credibility index can be used to iteratively refine the inner and outer approximations up to a desired precision. The main issues and performance of the developed algorithms are discussed and illustrated by means of examples. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
