500|$|CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband once more from {{a cell phone}} and told him the {{passengers}} were forcing {{their way into the}} cockpit. Jarrah began to roll the airplane left and right to knock the passengers off balance. He told another hijacker in the cockpit at 09:58:57, just two seconds before the South Tower collapsed, [...] "They want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> Hold, hold from the inside. Hold from the inside. Hold." [...] Jarrah changed tactics at 09:59:52 and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hardly think so, Fred. And, anyway, I don't see how he's going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> {{with the}} door closed and the blanket nailed over the window. However, we can keep our guns handy in case he does appear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That won't do at all!" [...] snapped Granny. [...] "They {{would make}} a great racket and waken Bowser the Hound, and he would waken his master, and that is just what we mustn't do if we hope <b>to</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> again. I thought you had more sense, Reddy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{may not be}} able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the morning," [...] said Gif; [...] "so we'll {{leave him}} some supper and some breakfast at the same time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity she hadn't. I tell you, March, it ain't so {{easy for}} a girl <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the East, that she can afford to despise any chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] Beatrice answered, [...] "and in case I should miss you, I wish to say something--to {{thank you}} for your {{kindness}} in helping me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> to-night. You have done me a great service, a very great service, and I am most grateful to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Zooks!" [...] he cried, [...] "I danced {{the soles}} off my shoes trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> yesterday, and I hear you were moping all the time, and paid me no more {{attention}} than I had been a dog scratching at the door. What! and have you fallen out with my lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You smash that door, old Bullfrog," [...] {{announced}} Lize, [...] "and I'll carry one of {{your lungs}} away. I know your howl--it don't scare me.

5000|$|In a Metal Injection {{interview}} he has said, [...] "You can't {{play an instrument}} for the technicality of it. It's a tool you use it <b>to</b> <b>get</b> what's <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and here and mind out there." [...] He has also stated that when he first started learning guitar, the prevailing trend was for increasingly virtuosic lead playing, and {{that he decided to}} focus on developing his intricate rhythm guitar style instead.|$|R
6000|$|Urmston laughed. [...] "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "In the flesh. I have ridden most of {{two hundred}} miles on horseback and <b>in</b> a waggon <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>here,</b> <b>in</b> the {{expectation}} {{that you would be}} pleased to see me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut my doors! Of course I can. He'll {{never be}} able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his nose <b>in</b> <b>here</b> if once an order has been given for his exclusion. Who's Mr. Annesley? I don't suppose he knows an Englishman in Brussels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{to stand}} by the window as I leap out," [...] he said when the evening was nearly come, [...] "and on the first flash of a redskin's rifle shoot at random if you see no target. The smoke will serve to {{partially}} hide my movements. Your mother is to take up her station {{at the front door}} until she hears you fire, and then she'll shoot over my head as soon as possible. I'm countin' that you can keep the savages back till I've gained a shelter in the thicket. After that the shutter is to be barred quickly, and you will both stand on guard at the front door, unless some danger threatens from the rear. If you hear the cry of an owl repeated three times from any quarter, you can be certain I have succeeded, an' there's no need of sayin' that you're to be on the alert for my coming. It's possible I shall be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> again. If I fail in that, and yet remain free, you may be positive help will soon arrive to raise the siege." ...|$|E
60|$|Mary {{thanked him}} and went in. She was not, however, {{quite sure that}} her baggage was safe, intrusted thus {{to the charge of}} a strange boy, and so she took a seat near the window, where she could keep an eye upon it. There was a blue chest near these trunks, which looked like a sailor's chest, and Marco, being tired of standing, sat down upon this chest. He had, however, {{scarcely}} taken his seat, when he saw a coach with four horses, coming round a corner. It was driven by a small boy not larger than Marco. It wheeled up toward the door, and came to a stand. Some men then put on the sailor's chest and the trunks. Mary Williams came out and got into the coach. She sat on the back seat. Forester and Marco got in, and took their places on the middle seat. A young man, dressed like a sailor, took the front seat, at one corner of the coach. These were all the passengers that were <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> When every thing was ready, they drove away.|$|E

5000|$|... "Nigel is {{a proven}} {{high-level}} player who possesses {{all of the}} qualities that we admire here at Gonzaga. He’s a very driven, team-oriented guy and is excited {{to be a part}} of this program. He’s also been great in the classroom as an Academic All-American, which fits in with our history of academic success.

6000|$|... "But I can fix my health," [...] he returned--"I {{may have}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some one <b>in</b> <b>here</b> {{and go away}} for a spell. Perhaps I'll do it. The doctor was saying he thought I might take a spell off and think out a few more {{wrinkles}} while I'm away." ...|$|R
5000|$|I'm {{not putting}} {{up or down}} what people did <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>here.</b> But in a nutshell, no human contact {{is a form of}} torture. Joseph Mitchell Parsons, 1998 On July 6, 1999, Parsons {{abandoned}} a federal appeal of his sentence to the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, stating that he preferred execution than waiting for years on death row. He complained that he was bored in prison, which he called [...] "torture, plain and simple." [...] The last visit Parsons had received was two hours with his mother in 1996. On August 16, 1999, District Judge Philip Eves signed a death warrant and scheduled Parsons' execution for October 15.|$|E

30|$|A {{few years}} ago, I didn’t want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{involved}} <b>in</b> anything <b>here,</b> I just didn’t want to, {{but through the}} diversity, this interest, you take your time.

6000|$|... "I {{hoped that}} I {{should be able}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> time, but ever since I saw you I have been going {{backwards}} and forwards between the ships and the shore, calling at the dockyard and prize court.

2500|$|While incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Speck {{was given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "birdman" [...] after the film Birdman of Alcatraz, because he kept a pair of sparrows that had flown into his cell. He {{was described as a}} loner who kept a stamp collection and enjoyed listening to music. His contacts with the warden included requests for new shirts, radio and other mundane items. The warden merely described him as [...] "a big nothing doing time." [...] Speck was not a model prisoner; he was often caught with drugs or distilled moonshine.

6000|$|Eustacia was nettled {{by her own}} contrivances. What a sheer {{waste of}} herself to be dressed thus while another was shining to advantage!

Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the chance <b>to</b> portray even half the range of emotions I <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> a one-off drama or a six-part series?

Boy I’m glad that’s settled, I was afraid I wouldn’t be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them <b>in</b> time. I got plain bands, nothing fancy, but they’re not the usual type. They’re not round, sort of square with a grooved ridge along each edge. I like them, they’re quite different, and match perfectly. Don’t tell Dottie what they look like, I want to surprise her. I hope she likes them. Well I guess Bobby is in Texas by now. I’m so glad everything worked out O. K. I don’t think Steve can be my best man, he won’t be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> time. I think I’ll have Tom. I should have him because I’ve known him much longer and I guess he is my best friend in the Army. I’m sorry you’ve got a cold honey. Is it any better? You take care of yourself angel. I think it would be best if you got the wings at home, I think it would be easier, and there might not be any down here. Well angel, I guess I’ll go to the movies with Tom now. I don’t even know what’s there. Thanks again honey, you’re very sweet to me and I love you so much. I can hardly wait to see you again. Goodnight Sweetheart.
