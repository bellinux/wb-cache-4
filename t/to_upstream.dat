25|$|The river has {{historically}} {{served as a}} source of both food and hydro-power, and numerous dams and mills were built along the river during the 1800s. Though these dams served the needs of the growing human population along the river, they also impeded movement of salmon seeking access <b>to</b> <b>upstream</b> spawning grounds, and they contributed to the eventual extirpation of landlocked Atlantic salmon from the river by 1872.|$|E
25|$|A {{coalition}} {{of environmental and}} conservation groups, and fishermen, argue that the dam should be removed. In addition to concerns about access <b>to</b> <b>upstream</b> salmonid spawning grounds, Searsville Dam inundated former wetlands formed by the confluence of Corte Madera Creek, Sausal Creek, Dennis Martin Creek and Alambique Creek. These wetlands likely served a valuable historical function by removing sediment and pollutants from the San Francisquito Creek mainstem. Anti-dam proponents point to a growing trend in habitat restoration nationally with over 500 dams removed in recent years.|$|E

From 28 February 2014, Virgin Media announced that they were scrapping traffic management for downstream traffic on 30Mb or higher packages, which was welcomed by many customers.

500|$|Cutthroat trout require cold, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms or cold, {{moderately}} deep lakes.

Most populations stay in fresh water throughout their lives and are known as nonmigratory, stream-resident or riverine populations.

500|$|The {{most serious}} {{impact on the}} genetic purity of most {{cutthroat}} trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the genes of both parents. In inland populations, the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in cutbow hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat trout subspecies. The introduction of hatchery-raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat trout subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout, has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies. As such, populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers <b>to</b> <b>upstream</b> migrations by introduced species. Fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke attributes the extinction of the yellowfin cutthroat trout [...] and Alvord cutthroat trout [...] subspecies {{to the introduction of}} non-native rainbow trout.|$|E
500|$|Flows at {{the mouth}} have {{steadily}} declined {{since the beginning of}} the 20thcentury, and in most years after 1960 the Colorado River has run dry before reaching the sea. Irrigation, industrial, and municipal diversions, evaporation from reservoirs, natural runoff, and likely climate change have all contributed to this substantial reduction in flow, threatening the future water supply. For example, the Gila River – formerly one of the Colorado's largest tributaries – contributes little more than a trickle in most years due to use of its water by cities and farms in central Arizona. The average flow rate of the Colorado at the northernmost point of the Mexico–United States border (NIB, or Northerly International Boundary) is about , [...] per year – less than a 10th of the natural flow – due <b>to</b> <b>upstream</b> water use. Below here, all of the remaining flow is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, leaving a dry riverbed from Morelos Dam to the sea that is supplemented by intermittent flows of irrigation drainage water. There have been exceptions, however, namely in the early to mid-1980s, when the Colorado once again reached the sea during several consecutive years of record-breaking precipitation and snowmelt. In 1984, so much excess runoff occurred that some , or , poured into the sea.|$|E

2500|$|The name Hells Gate {{was derived}} from the journal of {{explorer}} Simon Fraser, who in 1808 described this narrow passage as [...] "a place where no human should venture, for surely these are the gates of Hell." [...] Long before the arrival of Simon Fraser, and as early {{as the end of the}} last ice age, Hells Gate was a First Nations congregation ground for settlement and salmon fishing. Archaeological evidence from old occupation sites and isotope analysis of human skeletal remains suggest that settlement and migration patterns for indigenous peoples in the Canyon correlated with the seasonal migration patterns of Pacific salmon. During the last deglaciation 4000–6000 years ago, long tongues of ice formed wedges and dams in the river's basin above the canyon, resulting in the formation of large reservoirs and new lakes—creating optimal spawning grounds for salmon. During this inter-glacial period, salmon began to populate the Fraser River and used Hells Gate passage as their route <b>to</b> <b>upstream</b> spawning grounds. Constricted by two steep subvertical granodiorite walls, the incredibly narrow passage and high water velocity made this part of the upstream journey extraordinarily difficult for salmon, and they would hover along the shores of the river or rest in its back-eddies. As a result, Hells Gate’s geology provided the Indigenous fishers with superb opportunities to readily catch salmon congregated at the river’s edge attempting to elude the strong currents and rough waters. Hells Gate became one of the most popular fishing stations along the Fraser River— pre- and post-colonial contact— where large numbers of aboriginal locals, and eventually European settlers, congregated during the summer months to fish for migrating salmon. Standing on adjacent rocks or on specially constructed wooden platforms extending from surrounding cliffs, fishermen would use long dip nets to snatch the salmon. As salmon fishing at Hells Gate was so prolific that, as Matthew Evenden asserts, the aboriginal culture along the Fraser River was built on a “salmon economy.” After Simon Fraser charted the river in the early nineteenth century, it became (and Hells Gate with it) an established corridor between the Pacific Ocean and the interior of what was to become British Columbia. Yet, as Fraser first noted, safe water transportation through the 115 foot wide opening at Hells Gate has proven virtually impossible.|$|E
