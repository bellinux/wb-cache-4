Considering {{the complexity of the}} connections realized by these modern mechanical fasteners, this paper deals only with <b>plate</b> <b>anchorage</b> capacity (stress in the metal-wood contact). The aim of the conducted experimental {{study was to determine the}} metal connector <b>plate</b> <b>anchorage</b> capacity in accordance with the provisions of Eurocode 5 and also to analyze the ratio of the load bearing capacities of these two types of connectors in terms of their geometry. Experimental testing was conducted by loading of multiple samples up to the limit <b>plate</b> <b>anchorage</b> capacity. Discussion of the test results included the analysis of the connection deformation for different levels of load, as well as the mode of reaching the limit <b>plate</b> <b>anchorage</b> capacity. Review of the determined limit <b>plate</b> <b>anchorage</b> capacities, for the determined displacements of connection, was given in the conclusion, together with the comment on test results...|$|R

40|$|Deterioration in {{reinforced}} concrete structures {{is a major}} issue faced by the infrastructures and bridge industries all over the world. One of the suitable solutions is to modify and to improve {{the performance of the}} structure by introducing a new technique called “Strengthening”. It is not only cost effective but also helps in improving the service life of structures. To strengthen deficient RC structures, previously steel plates was used as external reinforcement but in last fifteen years, FRP plates have been used to replace steel because of their superior properties. The present study describes the flexural and shear strengthening of rectangular RC beams using glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP). In total, 12 no. of beams were cast and divided into 2 groups varying in steel reinforcement. One beam in each group, designated as control beam. Rest beams were strengthened in different orientations using GFRP sheets. <b>Anchorage</b> <b>plate</b> has been used to prevent premature debonding failure.

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the design calculation of <b>anchorage</b> <b>plates,</b> whose detailed behaviour is not well known. Due to the briefness of this investigation, readers are invited to amplify and complete it, and if necessary to correct it, since it is probable that a new investigation may include errors of method. The contents can be summarised as follows: 1. The classical design calculation of <b>anchorage</b> <b>plates</b> should be revised since it is based on an inaccurate idea on the actual behaviour and strength potential of mass concrete. Designers should know that this method implies a safety factor of the order of 10. This knowledge should give him confidence in cases of possible error, or when base reinforcements have been omitted, or placed after loading the structure. 2. The new calculation criterion is given in art. 54 of Code IEH- 68, which authorises stresses to be increased, though still keeping them within fairly conservative limits. Since currently IEH- 68 is the standard calculation code, it is advised that is should be strictly followed, and this paper should not be an invitation to anyone to go beyond the authorised limits given in this code. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to offer a more economic formula, but to clarify ideas. 3. A metal column directly welded to a baseplate, without cross reinforcements, is always outside Code IEH- 68, for normal slenderness values. However, this design can be regarded as fairly acceptable in the case of compound columns with separable extrusions (II,] [, []), acceptable for simple or joined extrusions ([], I) as can be inferred from tables 1, 2 and 3 (see the value of ɣ b) - 4. As a practical guidance, design calculations can generally be based on a stress of 120 kp/cm 2 El presente estudio intenta aportar algo al cálculo de placas de anclaje, colaborando en el enfoque de un fenómeno, en general, mal conocido.

The test conditions were carefully controlled and repeated for each flight {{in order to determine}} data variability. For the first three flights the cabin was untreated and for the fourth flight the fuselage was treated with glass fiber batts. On the exterior, measured propeller harmonic sound pressure levels showed <b>typical</b> <b>standard</b> deviations of + 1. 4 dB, - 2. 3 dB, and turbulent boundary layer pressure levels, + 1. 2 dB, - 1. 6.

When interior sound pressure levels from different flights with different cabin treatments were used to evaluate insertion loss, the standard deviations were typically plus or minus 6. 5 dB.
