Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about {{a person who is}} that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E

She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album. In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV. In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000. In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In 2016, she made donations to the Louisiana flood relief and Dolly Parton Fire Fund.|$|E

When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E

Music critic Robert Christgau viewed [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] as [...] "misogynistic as {{any piece of}} metal suck-my-cock." [...] Jon Pareles described [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] as 'reducing' Jackson to a [...] "terrified whimper," [...] while John Tatlock considered [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] as a [...] "confused lumbering slog of a song," [...] thinking that [...] "Jackson was never convincing {{in this kind of}} role, a boy-child trying to write a song about <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> he never meets in the kind of places he's certainly never been to." [...] Davitt Sigerson of Rolling Stone gave the song a more positive review; though calling it a [...] "filler," [...] she still commented that the song, along with [...] "Speed Demon," [...] is what makes Bad [...] "richer, sexier, better than Thrillers forgettables." [...] Sigerson noted that [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was a [...] "substantial recording" [...] because of its [...] "insubstantial melody." [...] Jennifer Clay of Yahoo! Music commented that while Jackson's edgier image was a [...] "little hard to swallow," [...] the image, musically, worked on the songs [...] "Bad", [...] "Man in the Mirror", and [...] "Dirty Diana", but was not [...] "to the degree of Thriller." ...|$|E

Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: [...] "I thought that was complete insanity.

[...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on." [...] Sharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: [...] "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't {{want to be in a}} hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong." ...|$|E

She collects fabric from curtains, bed sheets and linen and has done so for most of her life. She keeps such material that holds emotional significance for later use in her work. Many of her large-scale appliqués are made on hotel linens, for example, It Always Hurts (2005), Sometimes I Feel So Fucking Lost (2005), Volcano Closed (2001) and Helter Fucking Skelter (2001). Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in [...] "an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy" [...] and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work [...] "about <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> I hate, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women".|$|R

Eckstein was one <b>of</b> two <b>women</b> <b>of</b> color to be featured on the cover of this landmark lesbian political publication. The importance of Eckstein’s issue of The Ladder cannot be underestimated: “Her image on the cover, and her ideas throughout the pages of The Ladder, helped greatly to complicate notions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> who were involved in DOB and expanded definitions of lesbian identity".

2500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Xan Brooks of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film one star, {{describing}} it as [...] "a primped and simpering folly, the turkey that dreamed it was a peacock. Brooks predicted that the film [...] "may even surpass 2008's Filth and Wisdom, Madonna's calamitous first outing as a film-maker. Her direction is so all over the shop that it barely qualifies as direction at all." [...] Pointing out a scene, he added that [...] "Madonna has Wallis bound on stage to dance with a Masai tribesman while Pretty Vacant blares on the soundtrack. But why? What point is she making? That social-climbing Wallis-Simpson was the world's first punk-rocker?" [...] Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film resembled a documentary of a woman out on a shopping expedition. McCarthy felt that the storyline was especially dreary during the portrayal of the love affair between Wally and Evgeni. [...] "For the audience, Wally, despite Cornish's gentle and warm presence, offers very little in terms of personal interest or as a key {{into the world of}} one of the last century's most discussed couples." [...] However, McCarthy praised cinematographer Hagen Bogdaski's work. Oliver Lyttelton of indieWire also slammed the film stating that [...] "the use of music is horrible" [...] and [...] "We’ve never looked forward to Madonna going back on tour more, if only because it means that we’ll know, for certain, that she won’t be using that time to direct another movie." [...] Emma Pritchard from Grazia added that [...] "Wallis Simpson was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> who was accused of being more style than substance– and that, alas, is what Madonna has recreated on screen with W.E." [...] Mark Adams of Screen Daily singled out Riseborough's performance as a [...] "highlight", but overall felt that the film was disappointing. Leslie Felperin from Variety was disappointed in the film, saying that it is [...] "burdened with risible dialogue and weak performances". Felperin felt that the reason for the film's downfall was its script, which attended to the costumes and fashion more than the actual story, which she felt had much potential, but was unused.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{series of}} court cases in Australia in which {{teachers}} {{have been convicted of}} sexual crimes against children and adolescents has brought to attention the fact that females are capable of, and do commit, such crimes. However, the nature of the crimes does not reflect the range of sexually abusive behaviours females may perpetrate, nor <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> who may engage in such behaviour. We consider definitional problems in identifying female-perpetrated sexual abuse, and note that apart from one attempt to describe the range of sexual abuse perpetrated by mothers, there is little to guide researchers or clinicians in relation to female perpetrated offences more generally. We then consider approaches to categorising female sex offenders, and conclude that, although there a several such approaches that overlap in some ways, a multidimensional approach that combines aspects of each taxonomy may be more useful. <br /...|$|R
