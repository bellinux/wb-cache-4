Holstein was opened during the Second World War, in 1941. Formerly Nordberg was the next {{southbound}} station, but it was closed in 1992, {{at the same time}} as Holstein was re-built with longer platforms and new ticket machines. The name Holstein is believed <b>to</b> <b>origin</b> from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Family {{grounded}} in indissoluble matrimony: Family law was {{grounded in}} the concept of indissoluble matrimony, and parentage was classified according <b>to</b> <b>origin,</b> either from within marriage or outside of wedlock. Children born out of wedlock were further classified as natural, from adultery, from incest, or sacrilegious. This framework excluded non-Catholics, who had only gained the right to marry in 1888, with the reform imposed by Law N° 2.393.|$|E

He described the project as [...] "high" [...] risk for its [...] "technological unknowns" [...] as [...] "probably the toughest project on his wish list". It failed to get to production. He later left Origin for Looking Glass Technologies near {{the time that they}} were producing , but kept the idea in mind. For Thief, he tried to suggest buffing the character more so that the player could opt to fight through levels instead of sneaking, the original intent of the game, but the team didn't take to these ideas. He continued to change his character and game system plans for Troubleshooter, though the game he then called Junction Point did not reach production at Looking Glass. Spector wrote that the timing was not yet ripe because the business teams were not interested, the technology was not yet feasible, he did not have an interested team or the resources to make one, and that publishers did not want a [...] "first-person, cross-genre game". Spector, himself, was also tired of unrealistic fantasy and alien settings. Frustrated at Looking Glass, Spector sought employment elsewhere and was nearly about to sign a contract with Electronic Arts, when John Romero of Ion Storm approached him. When Romero offered him a chance to make his [...] "dream game" [...] without any restrictions, Spector was immediately on board.|$|E

2500|$|The blue {{trevally}} is {{a moderately}} large fish, growing to a recorded maximum length of 70cm and a weight of 8kg. The species {{is similar in}} general morphology {{to a number of}} other trevallies in the genus Carangoides, having a compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile. Unlike most of the Carangoides, however, the blue trevally’s snout is bluntly rounded, resembling the snouts of the pompanos of the genus Trachinotus and the lips of adults are notably fleshy. Two separate dorsal fins are found, the first having eight spines, while the second consists of one spine and 26 to 34 soft rays; more than any other species in Carangoides. In young adults, the lobe of the second dorsal fin is often falcate, but usually shorter than the head length. The anal fin has two anteriorly [...] detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 21 to 26 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has one spine attached to 20 or 21 soft rays. The lateral line has a gentle anterior arch, with the junction of the curved and straight sections vertically below the 15th to 20th soft rays of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 82 to 90 scales, while the straight section has 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is naked ventrally <b>to</b> <b>origin</b> of the pelvic fins and the base of the pectoral fins, but is interrupted laterally by a moderate band of scales. The upper jaw is highly protractile, containing narrow bands of villiform teeth, which become obsolescent with age, {{as is the case in}} the lower jaw. It has a total of 24 to 29 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E
