5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1899, San Diego Normal School became the first California normal school to offer summer courses, and {{maintained}} this position until 1913. On June 21, 1900, the first class was graduated: 23 women and three men. Later that year, the east wing of the initial building was finished, adding 18 rooms. In 1903, $61,000 was appropriated by the state for a west wing; it included a gym, library, laboratories, lecture rooms, and a museum. The west wing was completed in September 1904. In 1906, the California legislature required <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> {{a high school diploma}} in order to be admitted to a normal school. This was the same requirement as for entry into the University of California.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} is supervised by {{staff of the}} individual educational institutions, and the Australian Mathematics Trust reserves the right to conduct re-examinations {{in order to preserve}} the integrity of the competition, if it believes <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> not attempted the paper under sufficiently stringent conditions.|$|E
25|$|These {{classes are}} {{generally}} organized so <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> {{the opportunity to}} choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting {{it out in a}} performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of VSU {{argue that}} {{leadership}} of student organisations {{tend to be}} particularly drawn from the Left, which they argue is reflective of an aggressive leftist culture in universities, but which is not representative of the whole student body. This is seen in New Zealand universities, also. Opponents of VSU state that electoral processes are open to students of any political persuasion and <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> {{the right to vote}} for whichever candidates they feel represent them. Additional to this any elected representative can be rolled from a position by means of a vote of no confidence from the membership.|$|E
25|$|Ira Shor, a {{professor}} at the City University of New York, provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods {{in the context of the}} everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Its {{educational}} project being based on research, ENS seeks to train its {{students to become}} researchers. The main objective of the education given is getting a doctorate, and more than 85% of normaliens achieve this. The students are free {{to choose their own}} course of study but must at least attain a master's degree in research. Since, traditionally, the institution does not have the powers to grand university degrees, this entails <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> to follow courses in other universities in Paris. To this end, ENS cultivates a large number of partnerships and conventions with other higher education institutions to create master's degrees which are co-presided by two institutions. ENS works closely with the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), the Paris-Sorbonne University, the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, HEC Paris and ESSEC Business School in particular to deliver joint diplomas to a certain number of students who have followed courses shared between the two institutions. It is also the main partner in the Paris School of Economics project which it has launched along with the EHESS, the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique (ENSAE) and the École des Ponts. This project seeks to create a unified Master's-level economics school in Paris.|$|E
50|$|In September 2016, Coding House {{mandated}} <b>that</b> <b>students</b> sign non-disparagement contracts disallowing {{them from}} either publicly or privately criticizing the school. If Coding House determined <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>had</b> originated damaging information about it, Coding House vowed {{to take action}} against the students.|$|R

25|$|School year {{calendar}} {{starts in}} October and finishes in July. In 2004, it {{was among the}} first universities in Portugal limiting the time for degree completion. The degree programmes have a specified minimum and maximum time for completion. The time limit is 6 years from the date of first enrolment for the 4 years degrees, and 8 years from the date of first enrolment for 6 years degrees (i.e. Medicine). After <b>that,</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> to pay the entire costs of their courses. The tuition fee for undergraduate degrees was €356/year in 2002/2003. It was increased to €880/year in 2004/2005 and to €901,23/year in 2005/2006, the maximum fee allowed to state universities by law. Even with the time limit and the increased tuition fees, the university has had a high number of applicants every year. Like other universities in Portugal, and unlike the polytechnical institutes and many private universities, the university does not have special classes for workers or night classes. Overcrowded classrooms have been frequent in some disciplines at the Faculties of Science and Technology, Law, and Economics. In those occasions, students may stand during the classes or even stay outside the classroom. These faculties have the highest abandon rate and the biggest average time for degree completion. New buildings, campus expansion and modernized infrastructures since the late 1990s and the 2000s, have solved almost all these problems.|$|E
500|$|Although Lenin {{was not an}} enthusiast for avant garde art, the Vkhutemas {{faculty and}} {{students}} made projects to honor him and further his politics. Ivan Leonidov's final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a Lenin Institute of Librarianship. Vladimir Tatlin's Monument to the Third International was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg. Furthermore, Lenin's Mausoleum was designed by faculty member Aleksey Shchusev. Alexei Gan's book Constructivism, published in 1922, provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics, connecting constructivism with the revolution, and Marxism. The founding decree included a statement <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> an [...] "obligatory education in political literacy and the fundamentals of the communist world view on all courses". These examples help justify the school's projects {{in terms of the}} early political requirements but others would arise throughout the school's existence.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of {{education}} reform {{there is a greater}} emphasis on group projects, open-ended assignments on top of traditional homework. The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately two hours of schoolwork nightly. Along with extra-curricular activities, Hong Kong's education has become synonymous for leaning towards quantity. As early as March 1987, education advisory inspectors became concerned with the excessive amounts of [...] "mechanical work and meaningless homework". In particular, history education has been recognised as ineffective, with critics claiming that the curriculum is not capable of delivering a sense of identity. Not only <b>that,</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> to memorise the whole history texts, thereby indicating that rote-learning has greater priority than absorbing and understanding material.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S. {{and some}} of the English-speaking {{majority}} of Canada, students at public schools have historically been required to shower communally with classmates of the same sex after physical education classes. In the U.S., public objections and the threat of lawsuits have resulted in a number of school districts in recent years changing policy to make showers optional. Private boarding schools and military academies in the U.S. often have communal showers, since the focus there is on 24-hours-a-day education and rooming, rather than just acting as day schools. Students in these establishments need places to clean themselves daily. A court case in Colorado noted <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> a reduced expectation of personal privacy in regards to [...] "communal undress" [...] while showering after physical education classes. According to an interview with a middle school principal, most objections to showering at school that he had heard were actually from the students' parents rather than from the students.|$|E
2500|$|There have, however, been {{concerns}} about privacy {{within the context}} of the education market for Chromebooks. School officials at schools issuing Chromebooks for students have affirmed <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> no right to privacy when using school-issued Chromebooks, even at home, and that all online and offline activity can be monitored by the school using third-party software pre-installed on the laptops. Further, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has complained that Google itself is violating the privacy of students, by enabling the synchronisation function within Google Chrome ("Chrome Sync") by default, allowing web browsing histories and other data of students - including those under-13 - to be stored on Google servers and potentially used for purposes other than authorised educational purposes. A point of contention has been the fact that users of school-issued Chromebooks cannot change these settings themselves as a measure to protect their privacy as only the administrator who issued the laptops can change them. The EFF claims that this violates a Student Privacy Pledge already signed by Google in 2014. EFF staff attorney Nate Cardozo stated: [...] "Minors shouldn't be tracked or used as guinea pigs, with their data treated as a profit center. If Google wants to use students' data to 'improve Google products', then it needs to get express consent from parents." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{prevailing}} {{system of}} education, {{which we have}} inherited from the past, largely fails to accomplish this. In the first place, it has been authoritative rather than scientific, {{which is to say}} <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>have</b> been induced to accept the statements of teachers and text books, and have not been trained to weigh for themselves their reasonableness and worth; a principle essentially unscientific and undemocratic, since it inculcates in the future citizen convictions rather than encourages the habit of open-mindedness so necessary for democratic citizenship. For democracy--it cannot be too often repeated--is a dynamic thing, experimental, creative in its very essence. No static set of opinions can apply to the constantly changing aspect of affairs. New discoveries, which come upon us with such bewildering rapidity, are apt abruptly to alter social and industrial conditions, while morals and conventions are no longer absolute. Sudden crises threaten the stability of nations and civilizations. Safety lies alone in the ability to go forward, to progress. Psychology teaches us that if authoritative opinions, convictions, or [...] "complexes" [...] are stamped upon the plastic brain of the youth they tend to harden, and he is apt to become a Democrat or Republican, an Episcopalian or a Baptist, a free trader or a tariff advocate or a Manchester economist without asking why. Such [...] "complexes" [...] were probably referred to by the celebrated physician who emphasized the hopelessness of most individuals over forty. And every reformer and forum lecturer knows {{how difficult it is to}} convert the average audience of seasoned adults to a new idea: he finds the most responsive groups in the universities and colleges. It is significant that the [...] "educated" [...] adult audiences in clubs and prosperous churches are the least open to conversion, because, in the scientific sense, the [...] "educated" [...] classes retain complexes, and hence are the least prepared to cope with the world as it is today. The German system, which has been bent upon installing authoritative conviction instead of encouraging freedom of thought, should be a warning to us.|$|E
