In contrast to traditional approaches to trimming (e. g., for NURBS) we construct a new control mesh with each <b>trim</b> <b>operation.</b> This causes a perturbation of the surface near the trim region, which we control through the use of multiresolution details.

Their dynamic behavior is complex and highly nonlinear which makes their guidance and control particularly challenging. The extreme performance of the vehicles and the complexity of their dynamic behavior drive {{the need for an}} integrated design tool that incorporates operational requirements as part of the design process. This study is a first attempt at optimizing the configuration of supercavitating vehicles, in terms of overall dimensions, mass distributions, and control surfaces size, while accounting for specific requirements related to operation at trim and during maneuvers. The optimization problem is formulated by considering range in straight level flight as the objective to be maximized, and by introducing conditions on <b>trim</b> <b>operation</b> and unsteady maneuvers as constraints. The maneuver requirements are defined by the solution of an optimal control problem, which, for a given vehicle configuration, yields optimal control inputs and corresponding vehicle state time histories. Results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the process and to investigate the effect of operational constraints on the final optimal vehicle configuration. The presented methodology considers a limited spectrum of operating conditions, but it is formulated in a way that allows its extension to include a number of such operational constraints, as required by specific mission requirements...|$|E

Investigation shows that in rough cutting operation, machining speed and surface roughness increases with increasing discharge energy across the electrodes. Different values of machining speed and surface roughness were obtained for four work materials under the similar conditions of discharge energy. Due to the different values of thermal conductivity, melting and boiling temperatures, depth and size of surface craters on machined surface vary for each work material. <b>Trim</b> cutting <b>operation</b> at similar discharge parameters but with different wire offset were performed for four work materials.

40|$|AbstractTrimming {{operation}} as {{an important}} stage of many sheet and bulk metal processes is geometrically and physically complex and computationally challenging. This {{is especially true for}} metal forming processes where net-shape specification is critical. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for fast trimming simulation of 3 D forged components so that the effect of such <b>trimming</b> <b>operations</b> on post-forming material spingback, thermal distortion and final dimensional and shape accuracy of formed parts can be quantified. This approach comprises steps including definition of trim line, elimination of discarded elements, adjustment of nodal positions close to the trim line and mapping of the state variables from the original mesh to the new mesh. To evaluate the effect of residual stresses in <b>trimming</b> <b>operation,</b> a new algorithm involving a scaling interpolation and coordinate transformation procedure is proposed so that limited 2 D trimming simulations can be used to quantify and to map trimming induced residual stresses onto the whole 3 D model for further process simulation. This developed trimming simulation approach was verified using an industry case study in hot forging of a 3 D aerofoil blade by three post-forging cooling simulation cases including an untrimmed blade, a trimmed blade and a trimmed blade with the inclusion of trimming induced residual stresses. The simulation results were compared with actual measurement data of the forged aerofoil blade with excellent results obtained. The results show that the <b>trimming</b> <b>operation</b> has a significant effect on post-forging springback and thermal distortion but much less so on thickness of the aerofoil sections of the forged blade. The results also demonstrate that the proposed trimming simulation approach is computationally efficient and robust for other bulk and sheet metal forming processes of complex shapes...|$|R
