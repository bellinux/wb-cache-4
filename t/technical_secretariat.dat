40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM); its origin, development and future outlook.

It is further argued that the CMIM can bring about major changes to the policy institutional infrastructure of East Asia, particularly through {{the establishment of an}} Independent Surveillance Unit (ISU). The ISU can provide <b>technical</b> and <b>secretariat</b> support to financial cooperation processes in the region, which have thus far been driven by officials on a part-time basis. Consolidation of the main financial forums in the region is also proposed, specifically the Finance Minister Process and the Central Bank Process. Membership of these two processes should be expanded and unified, with the ISU providing <b>technical</b> and <b>secretariat</b> support. It is argued that regular policy meetings can be institutionalized and that this could enhance the role of East Asia in the global financial arena, whilst facilitating policy cooperation, with important regional and global implications. asian financial cooperation; asian policy cooperation; asian institutional infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of some key aspects of territorial cooperation (TC) and territorial integration in Scotland, Norway and Sweden. The first sections of the chapter focus on the strengths of territorial cooperation in the case study area, discussing the cultural and geographical conditions, the underlying motivations and domains in which TC takes place, and governance structures. In the subsequent sections, the weaknesses of territorial cooperation and territorial integration identified in the case study area are discussed. These include inaccessibility and peripherality, lack of impact, and lack of engagement with some groups of partners, particularly private sector partners. The findings are based primarily on semi-structured interviews with 40 subjects in the case study area. The subjects included 12 interviewees from Norway, 12 from Sweden and 16 from Scotland. Care was taken in their selection to achieve a geographically representative range of participants. Subjects were selected according to the spatial levels they represented (national, regional and local), and staff from several TC programmes were interviewed (e. g. Managing Authorities, Joint <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariats,</b> National Contact Points and Regional Contact Points). Beneficiaries of TC programmes were also interviewed (e. g. universities and colleges, regional groups, trusts). The interviews were conducted over the period 14 June 2011 to 10 November 2011. A number of documentary sources were also consulted, including regulations and draft regulations on territorial co-operation, and national and regional policy documents. Programme documentation (operational programmes, manuals, annual reports, evaluations etc.) was also consulted. European and national statistical data sources were used to provide the socio-demographical context of the case study area...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Hungarian-Slovenian-Croatian {{cross-border}} region, whose disadvantageous {{situation and}} hardship was {{dealt with by}} several authors, {{is placed in the}} focus of our research. Being aware of these facts it is conceivable that the subsidies from various proposal sources are of high importance for the cross-border region, especially those that support co-operation and region development and these proposals can become one of the primal movers of development. In our study the projects implemented in the concerned Hungarian, Slovenian and Croatian counties were involved in the Hungary-Croatia IPA Cross-border Co-operation Programme 2007 - 2013 and in the Slovenia-Hungary Cross-border Co-operation Programme 2007 - 2013 as well as the knowledge transfer methods in the managing organizations were analyzed. Each of the studied organisations belongs to the non-business sector as local government, school, foundation or association. It was characteristic of these studied organizations that in the 7 -year cycle of the given programmed period they were involved in implementing several projects; therefore, the transfer of the managerial and professional knowledge gained in certain proposals could be of crucial importance in case of further projects. As a result, the aim of the research was to assess the correlation between knowledge transfer within these non-business organisations and the success of the projects. The analysis is timely and fills a gap since both studied programmes were closed in 2013 and the financed projects were finished in 2014; therefore, it explores significant information and correlations with regard to the projects of the programmed period to be closed for both the Joint <b>Technical</b> <b>Secretariats</b> and the Intermediate Bodies {{as well as for the}} applicants...|$|R

50|$|By the 1960s, {{the economy}} was on a path of modest but steady {{economic}} growth. Real GDP growth during the 1960s averaged 4.2 percent a year, under the Latin American average of 5.7 percent but well ahead of the chaotic economy of the two previous decades. As part of the United States-sponsored Alliance for Progress, the government was encouraged to expand its planning apparatus for economic development. With assistance from the Organization of American States (OAS), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA), in 1962 Paraguay established the <b>Technical</b> Planning <b>Secretariat</b> (Secretaría Técnica de Planificación—STP), the major economic planning arm of the government. By 1965 the country had its first National Economic Plan, a two-year plan for 1965-66. This was followed by another two-year plan (1967-68) and then a series of five-year plans. Five-year plans—only general policy statements—were not typically adhered to or achieved and played a minimal role in Paraguay's economic growth and development. Compared with most Latin American countries, Paraguay had a small public sector. Free enterprise dominated the economy, export promotion was favored over import substitution, agriculture continued to dominate industry, and the economy remained generally open to international trade and market mechanisms.|$|R
