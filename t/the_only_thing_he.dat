25|$|Remarkably modern even {{to readers}} today, Montaigne's attempt {{to examine the}} world through the lens of <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> can depend on implicitly—his own judgment—makes him more {{accessible}} to modern readers than any other author of the Renaissance. Much of modern literary non-fiction has found inspiration in Montaigne and writers of all kinds continue to read him for his masterful balance of intellectual knowledge and personal storytelling.|$|E

Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend.

Augustine's mother Monica died at Ostia, Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa. Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property.

25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Ward {{relocated}} to Chicago, {{where he worked}} for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> lacked was capital.|$|E

'I still don't know what these words mean!'" [...] Gallagher has declared to be dyslexic, which slows down the process of his songwriting, nor can he read or write music.|$|E

He collaborated on the 2003 single [...] "Bring It On", with Chris Bailey, formerly of the Australian punk group, The Saints.

He had a heated argument with Yar Muhammad, saying that martyrdom by a king was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> wanted. Yar Muhammad (supported by the emperor's son, Azim-ush-Shan) recruited troops against Shah, but no war was fought. he held the khatib (chief reciter) at the Badshahi Mosque responsible for the matter, and had him arrested. On 2 October, although the army was deployed at the mosque the old khutba (which did not call Ali [...] "wasi") was read.|$|E

500|$|Jean became show runner of The Simpsons at {{the start}} of the third season (1991) {{together}} with Reiss.

When Jean began his tenure as show runner, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> thought to himself every day was [...] "Don't blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves." [...] The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] (aired September 19, 1991), and they felt a lot of pressure on them to make it good. They were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he [...] "kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough.'" [...] Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E

[...] Paul's tattoo of Woody Guthrie resulted in a chance meeting with Nora Guthrie, Woody Guthrie's daughter, at a Folk Alliance Conference when Nora asked to see Paul's tattoo. [...] That chance meeting resulted in Paul being invited to perform at a Woody Guthrie tribute show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. [...] The 10-day celebration, held in September 1996, included other notable musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, The Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco.

500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E

Billings cautioned members of the Admiralty that Sauer might publish them to the world before the Empress Catherine the Great would like.

500|$|After the {{uprising}} was crushed, Thi was deported to the USA, {{and lived in}} a small apartment on Connecticut Avenue on Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. Although the apartment was small, Kahin, who interviewed Thi after his exile, described it as [...] "handsome". However, The New York Times called it [...] "shabby". Thi left his uniforms in his closet in Vietnam and disposed of all his medals. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> kept from his military career was an army blanket. As part of his removal from South Vietnam, the American government gave him a substantial living allowance and paid for all his children's education fees. Around 1973, the payments were suddenly discontinued. In Washington, Thi spent much of his time at the Library of Congress, reading books about Asian history. Outspoken and still supported by many Buddhists, Thi tried to return to South Vietnam in February 1972, but troops loyal to the Diệmist President Thiệu surrounded his plane on the tarmac and prevented him from disembarking; the aircraft eventually took off and returned to the U.S.|$|E
500|$|Naming the {{characters}} after {{members of his}} own family, Homer was named after Groening's father Homer Groening, who himself had been named after ancient Greek poet Homer. Very little else of Homer's character was based on him, and to prove that the meaning behind Homer's name was not significant, Groening later named his own son Homer. According to Groening, [...] "Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> had in common with Homer was a love of donuts." [...] Although Groening has stated in several interviews that Homer was named after his father, he also claimed in several 1990 interviews that a character in the 1939 Nathanael West novel The Day of the Locust was the inspiration for naming Homer. Homer's middle initial [...] "J", which stands for [...] "Jay", is a [...] "tribute" [...] to animated characters such as Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J.
