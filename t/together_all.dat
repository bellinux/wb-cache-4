5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold <b>together</b> <b>all</b> of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E

Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.|$|E
