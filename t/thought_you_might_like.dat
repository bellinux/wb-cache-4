2500|$|In 2016, Lovely Warren, {{the mayor}} of Rochester, put a red, white and blue sign next to Anthony's grave the day after Hillary Clinton {{obtained}} the nomination at the Democratic National Convention; the sign stated, [...] "Dear Susan B., we <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to know {{that for the first}} time in history, a woman is running for president representing a major party. 144 years ago, your illegal vote got you arrested. It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way." [...] The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony's grave to sign it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hello?" [...] said Gertie {{over the}} telephone. [...] "Oh, hello, Carl; I just {{called up to}} tell you Adelaide {{is going to be}} here this evening, and I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to come up if you haven't {{anything}} better to do." ...|$|R

50|$|Kovacs {{began the}} show with this:There's {{a great deal of}} {{conversation}} that takes place on television. From way in the morning 6 AM... to all hours of the night. I <b>thought</b> perhaps... <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to spend a half hour without hearing any dialogue at all.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see, Sir Guy,' said he, 'there {{was some}} of us <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>like</b> to have us coming and singing like old times, 'cause 'tis not all {{as it used to}} be here with you. Yet we didn't like not to come at all, when you had been away so long, so we settled just to begin, and see whether you took any notice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a dull {{house to}} come to, my dear," [...] said Lady Ball; [...] "but blood is thicker than water, they say, and we <b>thought</b> that perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> {{to be with}} your cousins at Christmas." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wrenn implored: [...] "I--uh--I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to look {{at these}} magazines. Just dropped in to give them to you." [...] He was ready to go.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Lee,' {{said the}} Bishop, when that worthy appeared, 'I {{wanted to see}} you, to tell you you're playing for the House against Webster's. <b>Thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so early, sir," [...] said Brownster, [...] "that she said--I mean, sir, I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> {{something}} to eat, {{and if you}} want to enjoy a cigar before retiring, as many gentlemen do, you need not mind smoking here. These rooms are so well ventilated, sir, that every particle of odor will be out in no time." [...] Placing the tray upon a table, he retired.|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{the king}} coming hither, {{there is a}} chance that the Earl of March, and myself, will open the war by harrying the Douglas's lands. I can spare no great force, but even twenty tried men-at-arms would, no doubt, be welcome. As the king is going to march into Scotland, there is no fear that there will be any serious {{invasion}} by the Scots, and therefore you can be spared for a while. I think not that any of my knights would care to go in command of so small an array, but I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well. I {{certainly}} {{knew that}} you were going out of town. I did not at all expect that you would remain at home; but I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>like</b> to have your dinner before you went. Good morning, Lady Mason; I hope you may be successful in your--lawsuit." [...] And then, curtsying to her husband's client, she prepared to withdraw.|$|R
6000|$|... "Farebrother {{has just}} sent up {{a message to}} say that he wants to speak to me. He is below. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to know he was there, if you had {{anything}} to say to him." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was rather}} a fiasco {{and for years}} we didn't talk more about it than we could help, but it's no secret now and I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to jot down the facts in your case-book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Panney," [...] {{said the}} young lady, [...] "I am {{on my way}} to Cobhurst, and I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to go there, and so if you choose, I shall be glad to take you with me." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was no one}} in the room, and no light, {{when they}} entered. For a moment Grisel stood by the open window, looking out. Then she turned impulsively. 'My brother, of course, will ask you too,' she said; 'we had made up our minds to do so if you came again; but I want you to promise me now that you won't dream of going back to-night. That surely would be tempting--well, not Providence. I couldn't rest if I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be alone; <b>like</b> that again.' Her voice died away into the calling of the waters. A light moved across the dingy old rows of books and as his sister turned to go out Herbert {{appeared}} in the doorway, carrying a green-shaded lamp, with an old leather quarto under his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I--brought a {{few things}} with me," [...] {{continued}} the girl, with a certain hesitating timidity. She reached down, and produced a basket from {{the shadow of the}} wall. [...] "These chickens"--she held up a pair of pullets--"the commander-in-chief himself could not buy: I kept them for MY commander! And this pot of marmalade, which I know my Allan loves, is the same I put up last summer. I <b>thought</b> [very tenderly] <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> a piece of that bacon you liked so once, dear. Ah, sweetheart, shall we ever sit down to our little board? Shall we ever see the end of this awful war? Don't you think, dear [very pleadingly], {{it would be best to}} give it up? King George is not such a very bad man, is he? I've thought, sweetheart [very confidently], that mayhap <b>you</b> and he <b>might</b> make it all up without the aid of those Washingtons, who do nothing but starve one to death. And if the king only knew you, Allan,--should see you as I do, sweetheart,--he'd do just as you say." ...|$|R
6000|$|You may like to know, as a {{means of}} engendering a more {{complete}} individual interest in our actors, who they are. Jerrold and myself you have heard of; Mr. George Cruikshank and Mr. Leech (the best caricaturists of any time perhaps) need no introduction. Mr. Frank Stone (a Manchester man) and Mr. Egg are artists of high reputation. Mr. Forster is the critic of The Examiner, the author of [...] "The Lives of the Statesmen of the Commonwealth," [...] and very distinguished as a writer in The Edinburgh Review. Mr. Lewes is also a man of great attainments in polite literature, and the author of a novel published not long since, called [...] "Ranthorpe." [...] Mr. Costello is a periodical writer, and a gentleman renowned as a tourist. Mr. Mark Lemon is a dramatic author, and the editor of Punch--a most excellent actor, as you will find. My brothers play small parts, for love, and have no greater note than the Treasury and the City confer on their disciples. Mr. Thompson is a private gentleman. You may know all this, but I <b>thought</b> it possible <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to hold the key to our full company. Pray use it as you will.|$|R
6000|$|... "The same," [...] said Simmons. [...] "And he did more. He {{run away}} with your girl, the same as to say Miss Ella Baynes. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to know, so I rode out to impart the information." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Sammy, {{quite as}} if it made no {{difference}} to him. [...] "You admit that smart as you are you were fooled, and we <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to see the same thing happen to Old Man Coyote." ...|$|E
60|$|THE NEWSPAPER MAN [glibly] Yes, Mr Dubedat: I'm here, at your service. I {{represent}} the press. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> {{to let us}} have a few words about--about--er--well, a few words on your illness, and your plans for the season.|$|E
6000|$|... 'MY DEAR HUSBAND,--Why don't you write? Do {{you hate}} me? I {{have not had}} the heart to do {{anything}} this last week. That I, your wife, should be in this strait, and my husband well to do! I have been obliged to leave my first lodging for debt--among other things, they charged me for a lot of brandy which I am quite sure I did not taste. Then I went to Camberwell and was found out by them. I went away privately from thence, and changed my name the second time. I am now Mrs. Rondley. But the new lodging was the wretchedest and dearest I ever set foot in, and I left it after being there only a day. I am now at No. 20 in the same street that you left me in originally. All last night the sash of my window rattled so dreadfully that I could not sleep, but I had not energy enough {{to get out of bed}} to stop it. This morning I have been walking--I don't know how far--but far enough to make my feet ache. I have been looking at the outside of two or three of the theatres, but they seem forbidding if I regard them with the eye of an actress in search of an engagement. Though you said I was to think no more of the stage, I believe you would not care if you found me there. But I am not an actress by nature, and art will never make me one. I am too timid and retiring; I was intended for a cottager's wife. I certainly shall not try to go on the boards again whilst I am in this strange place. The idea of being brought on as far as London and then left here alone! Why didn't you leave me in Liverpool? Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> I <b>might</b> have told somebody that my real name was Mrs. Manston. As if I had a living friend to whom I could impart it--no such good fortune! In fact, my nearest friend is no nearer than what most people would call a stranger. But perhaps I ought to tell you that a week before I wrote my last letter to you, after wishing that my uncle and aunt in Philadelphia (the only near relatives I had) were still alive, I suddenly resolved to send a line to my cousin James, who, I believe, is still living in that neighbourhood. He has never seen me since we were babies together. I did not tell him of my marriage, because I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>like</b> it, and I gave my real maiden name, and an address at the post-office here. But God knows if the letter will ever reach him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{have had a}} school of your own," [...] said the lad. [...] "You know so much, and get on so well with boys. I should have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have been tutor at a college." ...|$|R

[...] "Only I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> {{to know that}} he questioned me close if I had seen thee on St. Valentine's Day, after the uproar at the Dominicans', and in what company thou wert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dont let me disturb you," [...] said Miss McQuinch, at his elbow, to Marian; [...] "but Mrs. Leith Fairfax will be {{here with}} Sholto Douglas presently; and I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to have an {{opportunity}} of avoiding him. How do you do, Mr. Conolly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From her manner, I should imagine not," [...] Dauncey replied. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, she asked first to whom she should apply for {{information}} respecting the Company.

He <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> possibly need a messenger to Hassan." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{old woman}} {{put her hand}} to her brow. [...] "I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have brought me some news of my poor husband," [...] she said at length.
