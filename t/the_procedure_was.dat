5|$|In 2001, {{scientists}} in Australia successfully implanted a Poitou donkey embryo created by artificial insemination {{in the womb}} of a Standardbred mare. Worries that joint problems might prevent a healthy pregnancy in the foal's biological mother led to the initiative. The resultant foal became one of three Poitou donkeys in Australia. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> unusual because {{it is often difficult}} for members of one Equus species to accept implanted embryos from another species in the same genus.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of <b>the</b> {{structure}} of <b>procedures</b> <b>is</b> central to <b>the</b> foundations of problem soling. In this {{paper we explore}} three principle means for teaching procedures: telling, canned loops, and procedural abstraction. The most straightforward way to teach a <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> by telling how to accomplish it in a high level goal-oriented language. In the method of canned loops the control structure that <b>is</b> needed for <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> supposed and <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> deduced. In <b>the</b> method of procedural abstraction <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> abstracted from protocols of <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> on examples...|$|R

5|$|At the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, the Soviet {{team won}} all seven of its games, earning the gold medal. Canada {{finished}} the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting {{the team in}} a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Before 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference in games against teams in the medal round; under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovakian team. During the tournament <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> changed to take all games into consideration, which meant that the Canadians finished fourth. At the time, the Olympics counted as the World Championships; under their (unchanged) rules, Canada should have received bronze for the World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{was in the}} {{minority}} for Gonzales v. Carhart, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority's decision to defer to legislative findings that <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with the veracity of the findings. Joining the majority for Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women's health, as Texas had claimed, but rather to impede women's access to abortions.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} {{was triggered}} by allegations that, in February 1903, William Bayliss of the Department of Physiology at University College London performed an illegal vivisection, before an audience of 60 medical students, on a brown terrier dog—adequately anaesthetized, according to Bayliss and his team; conscious and struggling, according to the Swedish activists. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> condemned as cruel and unlawful by the National Anti-Vivisection Society. Bayliss, whose research on dogs led {{to the discovery of}} hormones, was outraged by the assault on his reputation. He sued for libel and won.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{migration}} and evolution {{of the practice of}} circumcision is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> practiced by the ancient Egyptians and the Semites, and then by the Jews and Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the Bantu Africans. In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} {{has a big}} chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option besides the daily procedures is that one must give up one of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than human's, the donation requires both kidneys. If <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides {{to go along with the}} procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E
5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.|$|E

5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained the emancipation petition process. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent from home when the emancipation petition was delivered to her mother. Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed the emancipation papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the emancipation petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was {{returned to}} her mother by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer Gloria Allred and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} between Lehto and Lamy {{caused the}} safety car to be deployed, {{with all the}} remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, {{as a result of}} travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with Gerhard Berger, had expressed concern that the safety car (itself only reintroduced in Formula One in 1993 and only the third time used since then, the other occurrences being the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and the 1993 British Grand Prix) did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Senna was also worried by a procedure introduced at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix, whereby the safety car would lead the grid on the formation lap, rather than letting the race leader choose the pace of the formation lap. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>was</b> removed for this race.|$|E
