5|$|Local news bulletins for Newcastle, the Gold Coast, Canberra, and Wollongong were axed in 2001 due to falling {{ratings and}} the {{anticipated}} {{costs of the}} switch to digital television.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} <b>the</b> <b>adequacy</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public pension system in Romania, {{as well as}} that of the systems from other member states of the European Union, we applied the calculation methodology proposed by Filip Chybalski in the study entitled “Measuring <b>the</b> Multidimensional <b>Adequacy</b> <b>of</b> Pension Systems in European Countries”. Therefore, we started from a series of indicators put forward by the European Commission, which were grouped into three categories corresponding to the three main dimensions used when defining the adequate character of a pension system, namely income indicators, indicators reflecting poverty levels and gender differences (related to income and poverty levels). Employing these indicators, we determined/measured <b>the</b> <b>adequacy</b> degree <b>of</b> a pension system from a multidimensional perspective. The calculations were applied to 26 European countries over a three-year period, namely 2007, 2009 and 2011. Thus, the outcome of our research included a comparison and, implicitly, a classification. <b>The</b> <b>adequacy</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public pension system in Romania revealed improved levels in 2011 as compared to 2007, both in general and at the level of each dimension. </p...|$|R
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, <b>the</b> <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{criteria for}} licensing {{of nuclear power}} plants require that certain safety-related equipment and systems be designed to function during and/or following a postulated, design basis earthquake. Since many older, operating nuclear power plants were designed and constructed prior to the issuance of the current seismic qualification criteria, the NRC has questioned whether <b>the</b> seismic <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essential equipment has been sufficiently demonstrated and documented. In response to this concern, a group of affected plant owners formed the Seismic Qualification Utility Group (SQUG). With support from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), SQUG has undertaken a program to demonstrate <b>the</b> seismic <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> essential equipment {{by the use of}} available seismic experience data for similar equipment. The Generic Implementation Procedure (Glp), provides a generic means of applying this experience to evaluate <b>the</b> seismic <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> equipment.
