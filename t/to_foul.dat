5|$|The {{fossil record}} in this member shows the base was {{dominated}} by deposit feeders, while the upper layers were dominated by filter feeders. This can be correlated to the lithology: the finer sediments of the shales {{at the base of}} this member would contain abundant adherent organic matter for deposit feeders, but would tend <b>to</b> <b>foul</b> the gills of filter feeders when suspended; the coarser sediments of the sandstones at the top would have contained less organic matter to support deposit feeders.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued <b>to</b> <b>foul</b> Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E

Carlos Marchena and Carles Puyol were the centre-back pairing in possession, and Pablo remained on the bench for both games. He made his international debut on 17 November 2004 in a friendly against England in Madrid. He entered the game as a half-time substitute for Marchena, with Spain leading 1–0; with 20 minutes left, he appeared <b>to</b> <b>foul</b> Alan Smith in the act of shooting, but no penalty was awarded, and Spain had no difficulty retaining their lead. Pablo replaced Iván Helguera, who had previously been a regular selection, in the squad for Spain's next match, a World Cup qualifier at home to San Marino in February 2005, but did not play.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, Temple Owls {{received}} a two seed {{by virtue of}} a 14–2 conference record and earned a bye into the quarterfinals. Due to La Salle beating St. Bonaventure in the first round, Temple Owls was matched up with La Salle. The Owls won the game 96–76, posting their most points {{of the season in}} the process. Five players scored more than nine, and Ramone Moore led the charge with 23 points. Kevin Anderson of Richmond scored 22, defeating the Owls in the semifinals 58–54 and ending Temple Owls' ten-game winning streak at Boardwalk Hall. Ramone Moore hit a layup to push the Owls ahead 54–53 with five minutes left. Richmond grabbed the lead 55–54 at the 3:48 mark as Justin Harper scored off a putback. Harper finished the game with 18 points and nine rebounds, and was involved in a controversial end-of-game play. With 30 seconds left, Khalif Wyatt attempted a 3-pointer and Harper came down on him, but no call was made. Wyatt proceeded <b>to</b> <b>foul</b> Harper, who hit the deciding free throws. Wyatt had 15 points, while Lavoy Allen added 12 points and 10 rebounds. Juan Fernandez made only 3 of his 17 field goal attempts.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was <b>to</b> <b>foul</b> the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to predict the decrease of the thermal performance of glass furnace regenerators due <b>to</b> <b>fouling</b> by flue gas condensates. The model consists of 4 parts: {{a description of the}} thermal performance (heat transfer) of regenerator checkers; a description of chem. reactions in and deposition from flue gases in the regenerator; a description of the heat transfer in the furnace combustion chamber; and detn. of volatilization of S, chloride, and Na components from the melt. The aging and the redn. of the thermal efficiency due <b>to</b> <b>fouling</b> has been predicted for different checker-work constructions, {{as a function of the}} pull rate, as a function of glass melt temps., and as a function of the applied cullet fraction in the batch. Depending on the different conditions, the predicted increase in energy consumption is a few percent per yr, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>fouling.</b> Cruciform and chimney block checkers seem to be less sensitive <b>to</b> this <b>fouling</b> than pigeonhole and basket-weave packings.

Upon rounding the point, Essex lost her main top-mast <b>to</b> <b>foul</b> weather, forcing her return to the harbour. The British, disregarding the neutrality of the harbour, proceeded with {{the attack on the}} crippled ship. For 2½ hours, Essex, armed almost entirely with powerful but short range guns called carronades, resisted the enemy's superior fighting power and longer gun range. A fire erupted twice aboard the Essex, at which point about 50 men abandoned the ship and swam for shore; only half of them landing. Eventually, the hopeless situation forced the frigate to surrender. The Essex suffered 58 killed, 97 wounded, while the British casualties were 5 dead, 10 wounded.|$|E

Coming off {{the heels of}} her victory against Arcus SMS game and her {{recognised}} contribution's toward's several of Energa Toruń's victories, Lindsay was struck down with bad luck. Early in the game Lindsay was expected to pull off another career high. Only seven minutes after Lindsay was in the game she was caught elbowing {{a player in the}} face. The referee had then decided called a foul on Lindsay. She was sent off the court after playing for only seven minutes and 51 seconds.

25|$|North Carolina {{was playing}} looking for its 4th National Championship while Illinois {{was playing in}} its first National Championship. It was a tight contest {{for much of the}} first half before an 8-0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35-25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40-27 lead into halftime. North Carolina {{increased}} its lead to 15 {{at one point in the}} second half. But Illinois began a furious charge. At one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10-0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70-70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Head forcing Deron Williams <b>to</b> <b>foul.</b> However, Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws giving Illinois one last chance. But Luther Head's three pointer bounced high and out. Eventually it went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75-70 victory. For North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying it at 37. Sean May scored 26 points as he took the MOP of the Final Four.|$|E
