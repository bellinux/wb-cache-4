40|$|This Diploma thesis {{investigates the}} form and meaning of <b>time</b> <b>clauses</b> in present written English. The thesis focuses mainly on the area of time conjunctions, the mode and {{frequency}} of their application and it refers to stylistic preferences of certain conjunctions. The Diploma thesis deals with rendering of real time relations by particular conjunctions, semantic and grammar limitations of using some conjunctions with some predicates forms of main or subordinate clauses, using of tenses and their behaving in sequence of tenses. Diploma thesis sets itself an aim to point out some exceptions of using rules and show some examples of using <b>time</b> <b>clauses</b> functioning as different types of subordinate clauses. The theoretical part of the thesis is based on study of relevant literature, the practical part then is based on my own investigation for which the present written materials made by native speakers from different styles to represent both the formal and the informal English (novels, academic prose and newspapers) were used...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{syntactic}} {{status of}} non-finite constructions in English and Albanian? Are they considered as clauses? And, what is more, when carrying temporal meaning, can we classify them as non-finite <b>clauses</b> of <b>time?</b> Non-finite constructions, which are sequences {{of words that}} lack a finite verb, have {{attracted the attention of}} English and Albanian grammarians. Due to the variety of structures and semantic relations triggered by them, non-finite constructions stand in a thin line between phrases and clauses. While many modern English grammarians treat them as clauses, Albanian grammarians give relatively controversial comments on their status. In addition to the status of non-finite constructions, this paper aims at identifying the major semantic relations expressed by them, analyzing examples from a corpus taken from “The Da Vinci Code ” by Dan Brown, where <b>time</b> <b>clauses</b> make up about 20. 000 words. Comparing the examples from the original text to their counterparts from the Albanian translated version will offer a new prospect on the peculiarities of non-finite constructions in <b>time</b> <b>clauses...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore how the tenseless copula {{is to be}} {{interpreted}} in sentences of the form “a is F at t”, where “a” denotes a persisting, changeable object, “F” stands for a prima facie intrinsic property and “t” for a B-time. I argue that {{the interpretation of the}} copula depends on the logical role assigned to the <b>time</b> <b>clause.</b> Having rejected the idea that the <b>time</b> <b>clause</b> is to be treated as a sentence operator, I argue: (1) that if “at t” is thought of as being associated with “a” or “F”, then the tenseless copula is most plausibly read as an “is” simpliciter; and (2) that if “at t” is treated as being associated with the copula, then the tenseless copula is most plausibly understood as expressing a disjunction of tensed copulas. I end the paper by explaining the importance of the issue. I indicate the ramifications interpretation of the tenseless copula has for the so-called problem of temporary intrinsics...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{investigate}} usage forms and functions of the word “kaçan ” in Historical and Modern Turkic Written Languages as from Orkhon Turkic. This word is encountered on Orkhun Inscriptions, which is the first of written Turkic Language sources. The word “kaçan”, with the effect of translations to Old Uyghur, has been assigned to have a task functioning as a subordinate <b>time</b> <b>clause</b> in the following periods. This function is seen in all Historic Turkic Written Languages including Old Uyghur, Old Anatolian Turkish, Armeno-Kipchak. 20 th century is a period in which Turkic Written Languages were mainly refined from foreign elements and turned to its essence. Today the word “kaçan ” has lost its function as a subordinate <b>time</b> <b>clause</b> in Turkic Languages except Gagauz, and the subordinate clauses with ‘kaçan ’ are replaced with suffixes (-DIKTA,-(G) ANDA,-(G) INCA,-SA etc.) in Old Turkic.

Finally, we show how our framework compares to related work such as tccp, temporal logic programming and synchronous languages. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the typical tenses {{used in the}} main clause and <b>time</b> <b>clause,</b> and the semantic-grammatical interpretations indicated by such tense correlations. According {{to the results of}} the corpus analysis, the most frequent tense correlation in time clauses of anteriority is past perfect–past simple; simultaneity clauses, on the other hand, are usually characterized by the combination of past continuous-past simple; while relations of posteriority are usually expressed by the correlation of past simple-past simple. Thus, we can say that the correlation of tenses and moods of predicates is of high importance in strengthening temporal relations in complex sentences with time clauses...|$|E
40|$|Owing to its typological characteristics, English {{displays}} limited positional {{mobility of}} clause constituents, their {{position within the}} clause being an important signal of their syntactic function. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>clause</b> constituents may move out of their usual position if prompted by factors such as emphasis, structural complexity, information status, etc. What is true of clause constituents also applies to some extent to whole clauses. Unlike coordinate clauses in a compound sentence, subordinate clauses, particularly adverbial, may vary in their position, either preceding, following or even being inserted into their superordinate clause, with the resulting linear arrangement reflecting the relative weight of information which they convey, with the informationally heavier element placed finally. The position of nominal clauses and nominal relative clauses is determined largely by the usual position of the syntactic element they represent (i. e. the object clauses following the matrix clause predicate, etc.). Subject clauses, which represent {{the focus of this}} dissertation, are basically limited to two positions in relation to their matrix clauses: they either occupy the canonical initial position (i. e. before the matrix clause predicate) or are extraposed {{towards the end of the}} sentence, following the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Construction {{claims are}} {{a fact of}} life on all {{projects}} across the world. In an attempt to safeguard themselves against the risk of claims, employers utilise <b>time</b> bar <b>clauses</b> in construction contracts to waive the contractor’s entitlement to any additional costs or time if a notice of claim is not served by the contractor within a specific period of time. The reality of whether such a time bar is enforceable depends on the law governing the contract. Therefore, it is incumbent upon professionals contracting across different regions of the world and using standard form construction contracts that were prepared under a different jurisdictional setting than their own to be aware and acquainted with {{the extent to which these}} <b>time</b> bar <b>clauses</b> are enforceable under the law governing the contract in question. This research provides an in-depth insight regarding the enforceability of <b>time</b> bar <b>clauses</b> in English law and the Civil Code jurisdiction of Egypt, using the time bar in sub-clause 20. 1 of the FIDIC 1999 Red Book as the basis for comparison. The results of this research do not solely apply to the <b>time</b> bar <b>clause</b> in the FIDIC 1999 Red Book, but also to any <b>time</b> bar <b>clause</b> in a bespoke form of contract that acts as a condition precedent. The need for this research and its uniqueness stem from the fact that it aims to fill a critical gap in the construction law literature as, while there is an abundance of literature on the enforceability of <b>time</b> bar <b>clauses</b> under English law, there is scarcely any sizeable research dedicated to the same topic under the Egyptian Civil Code. The research utilises a comparative law methodology to compare the enforceability of the FIDIC time bar across the two jurisdictions utilising three key concepts as the basis for comparison, namely statutory limitation, good faith and the prevention principle. As part of this methodology, the research takes a step beyond the subject of the research and delves into the historical origin of the similarities and differences highlighted. In doing so, the research concludes with two key premises for the causes of the similarities and differences highlighted in the research, namely the principle of freedom of contract under English law and the effect of the French Civil Code on the formation of the Egyptian Civil Code. This, in turn, results in historical elaborations of both premises...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} [...] SART- {{to the development of}} real-time systems which is based on super actors, i. e., actors whose behaviour is modelled by statecharts. SART borrows structural concepts from known methods for reactive systems like ROOM and UML-RT, and favours ease of construction by making actors reusable and composable software components. The distinguishing factors of SART are its modularisation of timing constraints and customisable scheduling algorithm. Application actors are not aware of timing requirements. RTsynchronizers capture timing constraints in groups of actors, filter relevant messages and control their scheduling. <b>Time</b> <b>clauses</b> of causally connected messages in system interactions are directly derived from the declarative specification of end-to-end timing constraints.

40|$|This paper studies a {{contract}} design {{problem in a}} setting where <b>time</b> <b>clauses</b> are important. A principal hires an agent to complete a project within a fixed time horizon and prefers to have the project done as early as possible. The agent whose e¤ort is not contractible {{has a tendency to}} shirk and to delay exerting effort. We show that in the principal’s optimal contract, deadlines and payment schemes can be used jointly as effective instruments to motivate the agent to exert e¤ort and to avoid delay so that a better outcome can be achieved for the principal. Specifically, if a time-contingent wage scheme is infeasible, then a stochastic deadline can be strictly optimal for the principal. On the other hand, if the principal can adopt a time-contingent wage scheme, then the principal’s optimal deadline is deterministic and more importantly the optimal wage scheme features bonus for early completion...|$|R

40|$|Temporal {{information}} {{is a significant}} semantic carrier in natural languages. In a broader sense, when we speak of the temporal information contained in sentences, we do not simply mean those explicit specifications, such as <b>time</b> <b>clauses</b> or phrases associated with the actions addressed.
