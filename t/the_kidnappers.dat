He informed his captors that Gerald would also be passing by, thus ensuring Gerald's capture. Gerald's revenge was to inform <b>the</b> <b>kidnappers</b> that John's income was over 100 marks a year, which meant that <b>the</b> <b>kidnappers</b> required a large ransom before releasing John. John was eventually rescued by John Bellesmains, a fellow Englishman and former Archbishop of Lyon.|$|E

However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows <b>the</b> <b>kidnappers</b> a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and <b>the</b> <b>kidnappers</b> then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars.

40|$|Selten's {{game is a}} {{kidnapping}} model where the probability of capturing <b>the</b> <b>kidnapper</b> is independent of whether the hostage has been released or executed.

5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D {{platforming}} adventure game {{in which}} the player, as Donkey Kong and his friends, explores an island and collects items to progress through minigames and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: King K. Rool and his reptilian Kremlings invade Donkey Kong's idyllic island and kidnap his friends. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue them from <b>the</b> <b>kidnappers.</b> While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects bananas; enough of these will grant the player access to boss fights, which, in turn, unlock new in-game worlds. Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game Concentration. Minigames include races, minecart rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across eight themed worlds—200 goals in total, {{in addition to a}} connecting overworld. Unlike in prior Donkey Kong games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can fast travel between sections of the level with designated warp pads, and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player also collects banana coins, which unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.|$|E
