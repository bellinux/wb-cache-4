5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|According to chapter 9 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{the three}} {{brothers}} Vili, Vé, and Odin, are {{the creators of}} the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go {{on to become the}} progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of Midgard.|$|E

50|$|<b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fire II was {{developed}} {{by many of the}} same Capcom employees who worked on the previous game, including producer Tokuro Fujiwara and lead designer Yoshinori Kawano. While the character designs for <b>the</b> original <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fire were conceived by company head of development Keiji Inafune, <b>the</b> cast <b>of</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fire II was created entirely by artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who had previously only provided promotional art for the game's predecessor. Unlike <b>the</b> original <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fire, which was licensed to Square Soft for its North American release, <b>the</b> English version <b>of</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fire II was localized and published entirely by Capcom USA. The game was released in North America one year after the Japanese version in December 1995, and would later become <b>the</b> first <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> Fire title to become available in Europe in April 1996.|$|R

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E

50|$|Above the precelestial and postcelestial domains, Liu Yiming places <b>the</b> Precelestial <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> True Unity (xiantian zhenyi zhi qi 先天真一之氣). This {{state is}} beyond {{definition}} or description: “It cannot {{be compared to}} <b>the</b> postcelestial <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> inspiration and expiration, the thinking spirit, and {{the essence of the}} intercourse; and it also cannot be equated to the Original Essence, <b>the</b> Original <b>Breath,</b> and <b>the</b> Original Spirit” (Liu Yiming 2013:32). In alchemical terms, according to Liu Yiming, <b>the</b> Precelestial <b>Breath</b> <b>of</b> True Unity is the Golden Elixir (id.). The Elixir, therefore, consists in the conjunction of the precelestial and the postcelestial, and grants access to the higher state of non-duality, or True Unity.|$|R

25|$|He was an {{important}} representative of colour expressionism in the art scene of Yugoslavia during the 1930s. His landscapes of Dalmatia are reminiscent of the style of Van Gogh. He {{is best known for}} his series of paintings inspired by life on the island of Brač. Job himself said that “the beneficial influence of the Brač landscape can be felt, the hot sun, blue sea, and green branches of olive trees swayed by <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the maestral”. His paintings depicted the Mediterranean landscape, motifs of the town of Supetar, fishing themes, and more rarely portraits and nudes.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the entire}} process of evolution, the soul has been {{consciously}} identifying itself with the evolving gross body (sharir), yet, unconsciously, {{it has also been}} identifying itself with the evolving subtle and mental body (pran and mana). The subtle sphere refers to energy, or prana, a gross aspect of which is nuclear energy. In the book it is also referred to as the life-giving energy, or <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> God. The mental sphere refers to the domain of instincts, feelings, and eventually also of thoughts and desires. When the human form is reached, along with the gross body, the subtle and mental bodies also reach full development and although they remain unconscious, the soul indirectly works through them in the corresponding spheres.|$|E
25|$|The show falls {{somewhere between}} a cop show and a comedy show. Although superficially {{following}} the police drama format, the comedy derives from outrageous plots, the self-deprecating Canadian and the assertive American stereotypes, and the occasional fantasy elements such as the regular visits paid to the Mountie by his father's ghost, whose advice varies between helpful and absurdly useless. The tone of the show {{and much of the}} comedy is derived from Fraser's supernormal detective ability. For instance, in one episode, Fraser tracks down a suspect by smelling <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> a rat to determine the brand of barbecued ribs it had been eating. Another recurring gag is Fraser standing guard motionlessly in front of the Canadian consulate, while a passerby attempts to make him move or speak.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, the Penrhos College {{site was}} taken over by the {{government}} for Ministry of Food use.

The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from <b>the</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond.
