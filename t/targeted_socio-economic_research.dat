40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that firm-specific technological competence may be diversified and internationalised. We show that increases in competence increased corporate technological diversification until the early 1970 s, and then again more recently. However, a new interrelationship has now emerged between the accumulation, diversification and internationalisation of technological competence, due to the formation of internationally integrated networks within firms. The empirical analysis consists of a dynamic cross-section model applied to the corporate patenting in the US, of 166 of the largest European and US industrial firms from 1901 - 1995.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} survey of the recent {{theoretical}} literature concerning the analysis of the capabilities of firms and organizational learning. In a first part we examine the contributions of three approaches: the strategic management literature, the theories of organizational learning in the field of organization theory, and the evolutionary theory. In a second part we consider some major issues and open questions around four themes: the implications of analyses focused on knowledge instead of information; the meaning of organizational learning and capabilities; the problems of classification of capabilities and of definition of core capabilities; we shall then propose a few overtures on what we deem essential in order to further the comprehension of these problems: i. e. the taking into account of political and institutional dimensions of individual and collective learning process.

40|$|EC’s <b>Targeted</b> <b>Socio-Economic</b> <b>Research</b> (TSER) programme, {{and coordinated}} by Giovanni Dosi (contract number SOE 1 -CT 97 - 1078). Recent studies have {{suggested}} that large firms diversify their technological competencies through a cumulative learning process oriented both to augmentation in new fields as well as to exploitation in new markets, the corporate networks created for this purpose justifying the expression “globalisation of innovation”. Given the international dispersion of the creation of new technology within multinational corporations (MNCs) and their consequent change of innovatory strategies, the analysis {{of the relationship between the}} diversification and internationalisation of their technological activities seems to increasingly call for a contextual account of the locational issues associated with accessing capabilities and locally specific sources of innovation external to the firm. The purpose of this paper is thus twofold. First, it reviews the relationship between the diversification and internationalisation of technological activities by large firms historically and more recently, and to show how their closer association is bound up with the recent formation of internationally integrated networks within firms; secondly, it proceeds to investigate more thoroughly the geographical spread of such MNC networks within Europe, whether formed by European-owned or non-European-owned firms, paying particular attention as to the relative attractiveness of locations for the technological development of foreign-owned firms, at a subnational regional level within Europe. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the ability of Japanese {{multinational}} companies to transfer their domestic business practices to their overseas manufacturing operations located in Britain and France. It draws on two sources of information: the results of a postal questionnaire sent to the managing directors of the entire population of Japanese affiliates with production sites in Britain and France; and information based on interviews conducted with managerial personnel on the sites of three affiliates located in the UK and six located in France. While Japanese multinational companies, in so far as they have tried, have not managed to transfer their employment model wholesale, they have managed to create local hybrid systems which serve to promote continuous improvement in productivity and product quality. These distinct local combinations differ from the original template primarily in terms of the factors which determine pay and promotion and how these elements of the human resources system are linked to the organisation of work. While some national specificity can be observed in the form the local combinations take, there remains considerable intra-country variety. In this sense one can say that there are national effects without, at least for the moment, there being clear national hybrid models.

SERVEMPLOI (Innovations in Information Society Sectors – Implications for Women’s Work, Expertise, and Opportunities in European Workplaces) got financial support from the <b>Targeted</b> <b>Socio-Economic</b> <b>Research</b> Programme of DGXII of the European Commission. The project ran from January 1999 to December 2001 and included eight Euro-pean countries – Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK 2. The reports were organised around seven thematic chapters – Thematic Reports – which contained syntheses material {{from all of the}} eight countries in-volved in the study, based upon – National Reports – generated by each national team. The focus was on women’s employment in two service sectors – Retailing and Retail Financial Services. The retail and financial services sectors have a particu-lar significance for the European economy and for women’s employment and is therefore expected to be critical to the ‘Information Society’. They are both sectors which use and transform data, information and knowledge in order to sell their products and services. They are also currently radically reorganising their operations and their use of personnel in pursuit of those operations. These two sectors are also important employers of women. In both, women represent the vast majority of employees, particularly in the lower echelons of organisational hierarchies. Bilaga till Equal opportunities : Swedish final thematic report.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{shed light on}} the {{processes}} of technological diversification and specialization by firms. European, American and Japanese firms have been examined in 25 technological fields within telecommunications, information and audiovisual technologies for the period 1978 - 1998. In general, in electronics technologies incumbent firms are engaged in continuous processes of technological diversfication, opening up windows on new technologies. On the contrary new innovators tend to start highly specialized and most of them remain so. From this analysis an explanation of the European weaknesses in electronics technologies based on the weaknesses of both the core and the fringe of European innovators emerges. As far as the core is concerned, in electronics Europe does not have a big core of numerous large competent companies that span over mature as well as new technologies. In this way, big projects on broad technologies, the continuous opening of windows on new technologies and the pursue of multitechnology initiatives that requite the integration of different complementary technologies may be unpaired. As far as the fringe of innovators is concerned, Europe is characterized by a too high entry of small firms specialised in mature technologies. The problem here is not entry but survival. Most of the new innovators are not able to become continuous innovators and do not survive as innovators for long. Even those that survive are unable to widen their specialisation, and move from mature to emerging technological fields.

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the European Community Household Panel survey to chart the living {{arrangements}} of older people in 13 countries across the European Union, focusing particularly on whether older people live with a spouse, with their children, or with other adults. There are wide variations between men and women, mainly {{due to the fact}} that women are widowed at a much earlier age than men; there are large variations with age; and there are also large differences between countries. Men and women in a ‘Southern’, or ‘Catholic ’ group of countries are much more likely to live with their children, either with or without a partner, than men and women in ‘Northern’, or ‘Protestant ’ countries, who tend to live with just a partner, or to live alone. A large proportion of the older people in our sample who live with their children are receiving care within the household, particularly in the Southern countries; we also find that the giving of care is to a large extent reciprocal, with child care being provided within the household by the ‘younger old’, to almost the same extent as care is provided by other family members to the ‘older old’. However, this reciprocity of care holds only in the case of women: older men living with their children provide very little child care, while receiving the same amount of care as older women.
