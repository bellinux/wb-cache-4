40|$|This paper assesses {{competition}} {{across the}} banking systems in emerging market economies. The analysis employs the Panzar and Rosse (1987) methodology, spanning the period 2000 – 2012. The analysis emphasises {{the impact of}} the recent financial crisis on the extent of competition in <b>these</b> <b>banking</b> systems. The empirical findings are robust and consistent with those of previous studies, providing sufficient evidence in favour of monopolistic competition across all countries under investigation. The level of competition in <b>these</b> <b>banking</b> sectors seems to have undergone a significant decline after the recent financial crisis. This finding receives robust support from an alternative methodological approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} on 11 November 2016, but due to the unforeseen execution of the 500 and 1000 rupee currency demonetisation, which removed <b>these</b> <b>bank</b> notes from circulation, the release was pushed to 18 November 2016.|$|R

25|$|There are, as of 2006, 24 cantonal banks; <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> are state-guaranteed semi-governmental {{organizations}} {{controlled by}} one of Switzerland's 26 cantons that engage in all banking businesses. The largest cantonal bank, the Zurich Cantonal Bank, had a 2005 net income of CHF810million.|$|E
50|$|Following Germany's {{defeat in}} World War II, the Allied authorities, in 1948, ordered Deutsche Bank's {{break-up}} into ten regional <b>banks.</b> <b>These</b> 10 regional <b>banks</b> were later consolidated into three major banks in 1952: Norddeutsche Bank AG; Süddeutsche Bank AG; and Rheinisch-Westfälische Bank AG. In 1957, <b>these</b> three <b>banks</b> merged to form Deutsche Bank AG with {{its headquarters in}} Frankfurt.|$|R

25|$|The {{open market}} {{operation}} is also a means through which inflation can be controlled because when treasury bills are sold to commercial banks <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> can no longer give out loans {{to the public for}} the period and therefore money is being reduced from circulation.|$|E
25|$|Only five {{banks were}} opened during this time, while seeing many black-owned banks closed, leaving <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> with an {{expected}} nine-year life span for their operations. With African-Americans continuing to migrate towards Northern urban areas, they {{were faced with}} the challenge of suffering from high unemployment rates, due to non-minorities willing to do work that African Americans would previously take part in. At this time the entire banking industry, in the U.S., was suffering however, <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> suffered even more due to being smaller, having higher closure rates, as well as lower rates of loan repayment. The first groups of banks invested their finances back into the Black community, where as banks established during this period invested their finances mainly in mortgage loans, fraternal societies, and U.S. government bonds.|$|E

25|$|The {{second day}} of the Program of Seminars began, and an International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) meeting held. Press {{conferences}} of African finance ministers as well as Gordon Brown and de Rato were held at SSICEC. The World Bank announced that they will provide a US$15 million grant to combat bird flu in Indonesia. Seven lenders united and signed an agreement to combat corruption, <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> include the IMF and the World Bank. Also, CSOs discussed on several issues regarding daily issues.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 20 more {{banks were}} {{established}} during this period, which also saw African Americans become active citizens by {{taking part in}} various social movements centered around economic equality, better housing, better jobs, and the desegregation of society. Through desegregation however, <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> could no longer solely depend on the Black community for business and were forced to become established on the open market, by paying their employees competitive wages, and were now required {{to meet the needs}} of the entire society instead of just the Black community.|$|E
25|$|Since {{many banks}} had also {{invested}} their clients' savings {{in the stock}} market, <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> were forced to close {{when the stock market}} crashed. After the stock market crash and the bank closures, people were too afraid to lose more money. Because of the fears of further economic challenge, individuals from all classes stopped purchasing and consuming. Thousands of individual investors who believed they could get rich by investing on margin lost everything they had. The stock market crash severely impacted American economy.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{believed that}} <b>these</b> <b>banking</b> changes had no effect, {{and the financial}} crisis would have happened the same way if the regulations had still been in force. Lawrence J. White, for instance, noted that [...] "it was not [...] investment banking activities, such as underwriting and dealing in securities, that did them in".|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time the G-L-B Act's changes to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act would now allow for bank {{expansions}} into new lines of business, non-affiliated groups entering into agreements with <b>these</b> <b>bank</b> or financial institutions would also have to be reported as outlined under the newly added section to Title 12, , to satisfy Gramm's concerns.|$|R

25|$|In the mid-1970s, the KGB {{tried to}} {{secretly}} buy three banks in northern California {{to gain access}} to high-technology secrets. Their efforts were thwarted by the CIA. The banks were Peninsula National Bank in Burlingame, the First National Bank of Fresno, and the Tahoe National Bank in South Lake Tahoe. <b>These</b> <b>banks</b> had made numerous loans to advanced technology companies and had many of their officers and directors as clients. The KGB used the Moscow Narodny Bank Limited to finance the acquisition, and an intermediary, Singaporean businessman Amos Dawe, as the frontman.|$|E
25|$|Franklin's {{vice-president}} {{and general}} manager {{at the time of}} the fiasco, was new arrival, Edwin McEwen. He had initially been sent to Syracuse by a syndicate of seven banks. <b>These</b> <b>banks</b> had lent Franklin $5,000,000 in the late 1920s when Franklin was selling 7100-7500 cars a year. Herbert Franklin planned to increase plant capacity and develop new Franklin automobiles with the monies. The stock market crash on October 29, 1929, greatly reduced the number of automobiles that Franklin sold the following year and the company had problems repaying the bank loan.|$|E
25|$|China's banking {{sector is}} {{dominated}} by four large state-owned banks, which are largely inefficient and monopolistic. China's largest bank, ICBC, is the largest bank in the world. The financial sector is widely seen as a drag on the economy due to the inefficient state management. Non-performing loans, mostly made to local governments and unprofitable state-owned enterprises for political purposes, especially the political goal of keeping unemployment low, are a big drain on the financial system and economy, reaching over 22% of GDP by 2000, with a drop to 6.3% by 2006 due to government recapitalization of <b>these</b> <b>banks.</b> In 2006, {{the total amount of}} non-performing loans was estimated at $160billion. Observers recommend privatization of the banking system to solve this problem, a move that was partially carried out when the four banks were floated on the stock market. China's financial markets, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, are relatively ineffective at raising capital, as they comprise only 11% of GDP.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{you have}} 2 bank {{accounts}} (i.e. Rizabank and Bank Islam). For each of <b>these</b> <b>bank</b> accounts, you set {{a minimum of}} RM10,000. In the actual account, it appears Rizabank has RM15,000 while Bank Islam has RM20,000. The difference RM5,000 (from Rizabank) and RM10,000 (from Bank Islam) will be transferred to Bank Account C. This increases {{the possibility of using}} the surplus for other uses.|$|R
50|$|The CBJ is {{the sole}} issuer of the Jordanian currency. The CBJ, accordingly, ensures the {{availability}} of bank notes and coins {{to meet the needs}} of the national economy, and maintains an adequate inventory of <b>these</b> <b>bank</b> notes and coins for the same purpose. The CBJ also re-issues the Jordanian currency and replaces damaged, soiled, and mutilated bank notes. In addition, the CBJ issues commemorative coins.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>bank</b> {{notes were}} created {{originally}} in a bigger size and printed by the mint (Casa de Moneda), using French-made paper.Due to their size, {{and the paper}} not being of good enough quality, they began to deteriorate. They then decided to suspend the printing and look for another provider. The new notes, of smaller size, started to be issued in 1903, using typography as the printing method.|$|R
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{possibility}} is that the longphort was established on the gravel ridge overlooking the Black Pool – the most easily defended location in Dublin – and that its remains were subsequently buried or obliterated by the later 10th century settlement of Dyflinn, which {{was built in the}} same location (not to mention Dublin Castle, which presently occupies the site). The discovery of what are thought to be late 9th-century earthen banks in Ross Road and Werburgh Street (immediately west of Dublin Castle) lends some support to this theory. The other {{possibility is that}} the longphort was situated on the eastern or southern side of the Black Pool, and that Norse settlement began here, expanding northwards and westwards across the Poddle in the late 9th century. Norse houses to the west of <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> all appear to date from the Second Viking Age (917–1170). It is also a possibility that the location of the longphort was changed after the destruction of the original settlement in 849.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 Mujib regime {{pursued a}} pro-socialist agenda. In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed out to the public sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a non-performing loan, and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and capital adequacy took a backseat.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville {{has long}} had a {{regional}} legacy in banking and finance. Locally headquartered Atlantic National Bank, Florida National Bank and Barnett Bank dominated the industry in Florida {{from the turn of}} the 20th century through the 1980s, before all being acquired in a national wave of mergers and acquisitions throughout the entire financial sector. Acquired by NationsBank in 1997, Barnett Bank was the last of <b>these</b> <b>banks</b> to circum to acquisition, and at the time was the largest banking merger in U.S. history. The city still holds distinction nationally and internationally, boosting two Fortune 500 financial services companies, Fidelity National Financial and FIS, FIS being well recognized as a global leader in financial technology. Headquartered {{on the banks of the}} St. Johns River in Downtown Jacksonville, EverBank holds the title of largest bank in the state by deposits. The city is home to other notable financial services institutions including Ameris Bancorp, Atlantic Coast Financial, Black Knight Financial Services, MedMal Direct Insurance Company, US Assure, and VyStar Credit Union. The city is also home to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Jacksonville Branch.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{methods for}} {{processing}} arbitrary-length input signals with MDFT filter banks will be presented. The MDFT filter bank {{can be regarded}} as the most general type of a special class of filter <b>banks.</b> <b>These</b> filter <b>banks</b> have linear phase analysis filters, but different centers of symmetry due to subsampling with and without a phase shift [1], [2].
