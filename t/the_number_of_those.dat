5|$|At least 31mass graves were {{discovered}} in Kragujevac and its surroundings after the war. In 1969, the historian Jozo Tomasevich wrote that, despite German official sources stating 2,300hostages had been shot, both the Partisans and Chetniks had agreed {{that the number of}} victims was about 7,000. He further stated that careful investigation by a Yugoslav university professor in 1967 had put the figure at about 5,000. In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some estimates of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the figure at about 3,000. In 2007, Pavlowitch wrote that inflated figures of 6,000–7,000victims were advanced and widely believed for many years, but that German and Serbian scholars had recently agreed on the figure of 2,778. In the same year, the curator of the 21stOctober Museum at Kragujevac, Staniša Brkić, published a book listing the names and personal data of 2,794victims. Of the total killed, 144were high school students, and five of the victims were 12years old.|$|E

25|$|But what is <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> laws? Kant {{reviewing}} the enterprise of Aristotle {{in modern times}} has given {{a complete list of}} the laws of thought, but it is arbitrary in classification and may be legitimately reduced.

In the order of nature, that of substance is the first and causality second. In the order of acquisition of our knowledge, causality precedes substance, or rather both are given us in each other, and are contemporaneous in consciousness.|$|E

However, with growth in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> attending the Pope, the screen was moved giving a reduced area for the faithful laity. The transenna is surmounted by a row of ornate candlesticks, once gilt, and has a wooden door, where once there was an ornate door of gilded wrought iron.

25|$|The {{maternal}} death figure for Madagascar {{is lower than}} average in Sub-Saharan Africa, at a total of 498 deaths per 100,000 live births. This death rate remained stable between 2000 and 2009. This figure has been influenced by numerous factors. Although 86 percent receive pre-natal checkups, 49 {{percent of them are}} not told if there are complications. Approximately 46 percent of new mothers receive fewer than four post-natal care sessions. Most women give birth outside of health centres, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had assistance in giving birth is decreasing; according to Sharp and Kruse, 35 percent of Malagasy women who give birth outside of health centres do not receive medical care. Abortions due to unwanted pregnancies are also a major contributor.|$|E
25|$|Between 25,000 and 70,000 American Patriots {{died during}} active {{military}} service. Of these, approximately 6,800 {{were killed in}} battle, while at least 17,000 died from disease.
