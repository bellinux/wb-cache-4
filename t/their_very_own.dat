25|$|Asian Kung-Fu Generation {{was first}} formed in 1996 when Masafumi Gotō, Kensuke Kita, and Takahiro Yamada met while {{attending}} a music club at Kanto Gakuin University, a private university in Yokohama, Japan. After realizing {{that they all}} shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> band. Masafumi Gotō became the lead vocalist and played rhythm guitar, Kensuke Kita played lead guitar and sang backup and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local Yokohama area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having collaborated with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first indie EP in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in English. The four spent {{the remainder of the}} year playing in clubs and hosting independent events.|$|E
25|$|It {{was as a}} {{performer}} on The Frost Report that Cleese achieved his breakthrough on British television as a comedy actor, appearing as the tall, patrician figure in the classic class sketch, contrasting comically in a line-up with the shorter, middle class Ronnie Barker and the even shorter, working class Ronnie Corbett. This series was so popular that in 1966 Cleese and Chapman were invited to work as writers and performers with Brooke-Taylor and Feldman on At Last the 1948 Show, during which time the Four Yorkshiremen sketch was written by all four writers/performers (the Four Yorkshiremen sketch is now better known as a Monty Python sketch). Cleese and Chapman also wrote episodes for the first series of Doctor in the House (and later Cleese wrote six episodes of Doctor at Large on his own in 1971). These series were successful, and in 1969 Cleese and Chapman were offered <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> series. However, owing to Chapman's alcoholism, Cleese found himself bearing an increasing workload in the partnership and was, therefore, unenthusiastic about doing a series with {{just the two of}} them. He had found working with Palin on The Frost Report an enjoyable experience and invited him to join the series. Palin had previously been working on Do Not Adjust Your Set with Idle and Jones, with Terry Gilliam creating the animations. The four of them had, {{on the back of the}} success of Do Not Adjust Your Set, been offered a series for Thames Television, which they were waiting to begin when Cleese's offer arrived. Palin agreed to work with Cleese and Chapman in the meantime, bringing with him Gilliam, Jones, and Idle.|$|E

2500|$|As the Soviet Union {{was being}} created, Rakovsky became {{opposed to the}} new central {{leadership}} {{over the issue of}} self-determination for the Soviet republics and autonomous republics. This followed the dispute between, on one side, Joseph Stalin, Zinoviev, Totsky and Kamenev, and, on the other, the leadership of the Georgian SSR (see Georgian Affair). At the time, he evidenced a [...] "permanent struggle which the so-called independent and autonomous republics had to carry out to safeguard not only their prerogatives but <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> existence". Arguing in favor of extending the revolution from Ukraine to the Balkans, and indicating his belief that the peasantry was being alienated by internationalist messages, Rakovsky cited concerns that centralism was placing Soviet influence in peril, and called for [...] "carrying out a correct theoretical and practical solution to the national question within the boundaries of the Soviet Union". In November 1922, he successfully proposed the formation of a Soviet of Nationalities to double the Soviet of the Union inside the supreme legislative body; his arguments in favor of reducing the number of representatives of Russian SFSR and barring the total number of envoys from any republic at one fifth of the total were dismissed after being criticized by Stalin.|$|E

2500|$|By 1861 {{there were}} several small river mill settlements, some mining camps and about nine or ten towns (seven platted) in Jasper County, Missouri. [...] Avilla was newly formed and [...] "bustling" [...] with over one hundred {{citizens}} (compare with the county seat of Carthage, Missouri that had an estimated population between four and five hundred at that time). As {{in all of the}} border state towns, families in Avilla were split over the question of Missouri secession, and some were slave owners. [...] Dr. Jaquillian M. Stemmons actually owned eight inherited slaves himself; however, he and the other town leaders were Unconditional Unionists and remained aligned with newly elected president Abraham Lincoln. [...] Dr. J.M. Stemmons never bought or sold slaves and was known to have retained his family inherited slaves simply for <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> safety. [...] He supported the abolition of slavery in the United States. [...] Avilla's political alignment was in sharp contrast to neighboring Sarcoxie to the south where the first regional Confederate flag was raised. The rebel [...] "Stars & Bars" [...] also flew over Carthage [...] to the west in 1861, following an early Confederate victory at the Battle of Carthage on July 5. [...] At a distance of only two counties away, Arkansas had already become the ninth state to secede, and on October 28, 1861 Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson met with the Missouri General Assembly in Neosho and declared Missouri as the twelfth state to join the Confederate States of America. In spite of being engulfed by the Confederacy, the United States flag continued to fly over Avilla, boldly hoist {{to the top of a}} flagpole in the town center park and guarded by the townsmen. [...] Schoolhouses were closed and many families evacuated their women and small children to safer areas in other states.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} on 24 July 1908, Goltz denied the charge often made in the West that the Ottoman {{authorities}} had oppressed the Christian population of Macedonia and were committing systematic human rights abuses. Goltz wrote: [...] "Nevertheless, what the Westerners write about the Turkish government is not honest. Most of the time, {{it is the case}} that those Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs, who have had terrible experiences at the hands of <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> nationals, ask for Turkish protection. They know that the Turks are filled with generosity and compassion. They forgot and forgive. For being compassionate to the weak is part of their national traditions and they are proud of it." [...] Goltz denied the charge of widespread human rights abuses against the Christians, writing: [...] "Now, the Ottoman administration there is much better than it is thought. The Ottoman governors there, either generals or civilian employees, are young, healthy and knowledgeable men. If they are left to themselves, they can protect the peace perfectly well." [...] Anyhow, Goltz wrote the Europeans [...] "never think about the real owners of the country, the Turks, who constitute the majority in Macedonia … Ottoman staff officers, since 1887, under my direction, have prepared the maps of the Ottoman Balkans and we have found many Turkish villages, which have not been shown in other maps, besides Slav and Greek ones. Turks, in short, have a great right to be in Macedonia. Goltz advised his protégés in the Committee of Union and Progress: [...] "Be powerful so you will not be subject to injustice." [...] In 1910, Goltz advised Pertev to create a para-military youth organization that would serve to [...] "inspire a patriotic and soldierly spirit in youth, to fill them with joy at the fame and greatness of Turkey, {{and at the same time}} to give them a healthy physical education, which prepares them for the military profession." [...] Goltz further added that the purpose of education of youth was [...] "the formation of the patriotic sense, love of the fatherland, soldierly virtues and the toughening of the body, less so the technical preparation of the growing generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yet whilst {{equipment}} was lacking and outdated, Italian authorities were {{acutely aware of}} the need to maintain a modern army and were taking the necessary steps to modernize in accordance with <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>own</b> relatively advanced tactical principles. Almost 40% of the 1939 budget was allocated to military spending. Awareness existed, albeit belatedly, of the need to have close air support for the Navy and the decision to build carriers was taken And whilst the majority of {{equipment was}} obsolescent and poor, appropriate steps were being taken whereby quality equipment was being developed. For example, the three series 5 fighters were capable of meeting the best allied fighters on equal terms, but only a few hundred of each were produced; The [...] Fiat G55 Centauro received much German interest and was defined by Oberst Petersen, advisor to Goering, as the [...] "best Axis fighter." [...] The Carro Armato P40 tank, roughly equivalent to the M4 Sherman and Panzer IV, was designed in 1940, but no prototype was produced until 1942 and developers/manufacturers not able to roll out any of these tanks before Armistice. This was owing, in part, to the lack of sufficiently powerful engines, which were themselves undergoing a development push. Unlike the Allies, Italian tank designers did not think to use old aircraft engines, which were available in relative abundance, and would have certainly facilitated more rapid tank development. Total tank production for the war (≈3,500) was less than the number of tanks used by Germany in its invasion of France. The Italians were also reported {{to be the first to}} use self-propelled guns, both in close support and anti-tank roles, and their, for example, 75/46 (& 75/32), 90/53 (a peer of the German 88/55), 102/35 and 47/32 mm, and 20 mm AA guns were not obsolete. Also of note were the AB 41 and the Camionetta AS 42 which were regarded as excellent vehicles of their type. None of these developments precluded the fact that the bulk of the equipment was obsolescent and poor. However, it was this relatively weak economy, lack of suitable raw materials and inability to produce suitable quantities of armaments and supplies which was predominant reason for Italian military failure.|$|E
