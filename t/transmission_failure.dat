5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a <b>transmission</b> <b>failure</b> forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} {{began to spread}} out {{in the second half}} of the race, and by lap 54 Lewis Hamilton was leading Rosberg by 10.06 seconds, with Vettel a further 12.12 seconds behind Rosberg. However, due to Ferrari's earlier attempt to {{undercut}} Rosberg by pitting Vettel early, Räikkönen's tyres were 4 laps fresher than his teammate's, and he closed in on Vettel over the final stint. Having emerged from his final pit stop 4.84 seconds behind Vettel on lap 35, Räikkönen had closed the gap to 1.37 seconds by lap 54. However, the chance of a battle between the Ferrari teammates was extinguished after a <b>transmission</b> <b>failure</b> on Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso, who was stranded on the start/finish-straight, brought out the safety car for the final two laps, meaning that the race ended under safety car conditions.|$|E

40|$|WirelessHART {{networks}} are gaining ground as a real-time communication infrastructure in industrial wireless control systems. Because wireless communication is often susceptible to <b>transmission</b> <b>failures</b> in industrial environments, {{it is essential}} to account for failures in the delay analysis for realtime flows between sensors and actuators in process control. WirelessHART networks handle <b>transmission</b> <b>failures</b> through retransmissions using dedicated and shared time slots through different paths in the routing graphs. While these mechanisms for handling <b>transmission</b> <b>failures</b> are critical for process control requiring reliable communication, they introduce substantial challenges to worst-case end-to-end delay analysis for real-time flows. This paper presents the first worst-case end-to-end delay analysis for periodic real-time flows in a WirelessHART network that takes into account <b>transmission</b> <b>failures.</b> The delay bounds can be used to quickly assess the schedulability of real-time flows for industrial wireless control applications with stringent requirements on both high reliability and network latency. Simulations based on the topologies of a wireless sensor network testbed consisting of 69 TelosB motes indicate that our analysis provides safe upper bounds of the end-to-end [...] .

This renders many plausible network structures inefficient. We show that requiring robustness {{with respect to}} stochastic <b>transmission</b> <b>failures</b> rehabilitates incomplete, circular network structures. Specifically, we show that near the "bifurcation" where both star and complete network are efficient in the standard connections model, star and complete network are generally inefficient as <b>transmission</b> <b>failures</b> become possible.

25|$|The Williams team's {{decision}} {{to develop their}} new semi-automatic gearbox by racing with it {{at the start of}} the season, was at the cost of points in the opening rounds of the championship. Senna was on 40 points with four straight wins to open the season by the time Mansell gained his first finish with a second in Monaco. Mansell then had the next race in Canada practically won when his Williams FW14 stopped half a lap from the finish with what was reported to be <b>transmission</b> <b>failure,</b> though it was suspected that Mansell had let his engine revs drop too low while he was waving to the crowd in celebration and stalled his engine. Ironically this handed Nelson Piquet his 23rd and last F1 race win. Despite a good mid-season, which included a hat-trick of victories, Senna's consistency (and Mansell's retirements at key races) meant that he finished second in the Championship for the third time in his career, this time behind Senna.|$|E
25|$|The Bristol 450 {{made its}} race debut at the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Two cars were entered, {{with a third}} held back as a spare. Unfortunately for Bristol, both were out before half {{distance}} with near-identical failures. In each case the balance weights became detached from the crankshaft. This caused the rear wheels to lock at high speed, in turn causing the cars to veer {{off the road and}} catch fire. However, in the laps that the cars had managed to complete, Jack Fairman easily managed to post a new lap record for the 2 litre class. The cars were rebuilt at the factory, incorporating the revised aerodynamic bodywork, and only three weeks later, in early July, were entered into the 12h race at Reims. The Reims track shared the high speed character of its French cousin at La Sarthe and suited the Bristol's character well. Although one car again broke down, this time due to <b>transmission</b> <b>failure</b> on the first lap, the remaining car cruised to a class victory and finished fifth overall.|$|E

Because of Brad Keselowski's injury during a {{practice}} crash at Road Atlanta, Busch filled in for Keselowski in his NASCAR Nationwide Series car for the Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen International, and Busch managed to get the pole and the win. By August 13, 2011, Busch had won 1/4 of all of his Nationwide races. On October 2, Busch won on two late restarts beating Jimmie Johnson in turn 1 leading the final 43 laps to grab his first ever victory at the Monster Mile at Dover. After a frustrating final five races, things came to a head when Busch launched a verbal tirade against an ESPN cameraman, and giving an obscene gesture to workers when a car blocked his path towards his pit garage following a <b>transmission</b> <b>failure</b> at the same race.

Again, Hubert raced at Sears Point where he would finish in the 33rd position, one lap down. He also attempted the Pepsi 400 at Michigan, however {{he was unable to}} qualify. In 2000, he would make one start with Penske Racing and the #12 Mobil 1 Ford. He would finish the Global Crossing @ The Glen in 33rd place after starting 16th. In 2001, Hubert qualified Buckshot Jones' #44 Georgia Pacific Dodge for the Dodge/Save Mart 350. In 2002, he would race the Sirius Satellite Radio at the Glen for Bill Davis Racing. Hubert finished the #23 Hills Brothers Coffee Dodge in the 24th position after starting 40th. He would return to the series in 2004 with Kirk Shelmerdine Racing, driving each of the road courses. At the newly renamed Infineon Raceway (formerly Sears Point Raceway) he would finish 43rd in the #72 Freddie B's Ford after running five laps at too slow of a pace for NASCAR. The Watkins Glen would be much better for Hubert as he would finish in the 29th position just one lap down. He would return to Shelmerdine's team for 2005 and attempt each of the road courses. He would make the race at Infineon, however he finished 43rd after oil pressure problems. Hubert would not make the Sirius at The Glen after qualifying was rained out.
