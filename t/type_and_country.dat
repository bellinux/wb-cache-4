Data on development time for standards was collected through use of the W 3 C API 11, where the date for the first release (typically a working draft) and the latest release (the recommendation) of a standard was collected and used for calculations. Custom made scripts were used throughout in order to parse and analyse the data and derive results.

MethodsItems of the CTSQ were generated through the review of responses from interviews with oncology patients, physicians, and nurses. Analysis of the data was stratified by disease stage, disease <b>type,</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> to explore potential differences between these groups. Two rounds of face and content validity testing were then conducted. ResultsPatients explained their hopes for efficacy and factors related to treatment satisfaction. Content validity testing in 30 patients, followed by additional testing in 10 patients on oral therapy, suggested that patients felt the questionnaire was clear, comprehensive, relevant, and easy to complete. Minor revisions were implemented to improve clarity, resulting in deletion of 12 items, modification of 17 items and the rewording of “chemotherapy” to “cancer therapy” to ensure patients on oral therapy were able to respond. The CTSQ contains 21 items and assesses seven domains: Expectations of cancer therapy, Feelings about side effects, Oral cancer therapy adherence, Convenience, Satisfaction with cancer therapy, Stopping cancer therapy, and Reasons for nonadherence.

40|$|The Georges Bank {{ecosystem}} {{has undergone}} {{dramatic changes in}} biomass and species dominance under exploitation. Sharp declines in the biomass of both pelagic and demersal fish populations have occurred associated with rapid increases in fishing effort by distant water fleets. We corrected nominal effort series for changes in vessel size, gear <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> of origin {{in an attempt to}} provide a measure of the intensity of the perturbation resulting from large scale changes in exploitation patterns on Georges Bank. A fourfold increase was noted in standardized effort over the period 1960 – 72. Declines in catch-per-standard day fished, and relative biomass indices derived from research vessel surveys indicated marked decreases in all components of the system during the period 1960 – 76. Decreases in fishing effort were effected with the implementation of extended jurisdiction to 200 miles in 1977; however, several major stocks had collapsed by that time. Fundamental changes were noted in the production levels on Georges Bank during the period 1960 – 76. Declines in overall production can be attributed largely to the collapse of the herring population by 1976 – 77 under heavy exploitation. Recent increases in biomass of elasmobranchs and principal pelagic species (herring and mackerel) have resulted in further shifts in system structure. The biomass of piscivores is currently high and this shift may act synergistically with increasing exploitation rates to cause further declines in biomass of commercially desirable species...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in the consumption of animal products is likely to put further pressure on the world’s freshwater resources. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the water footprint of animal products, considering different production systems and feed composition per animal <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>country.</b> Nearly one-third of the total water footprint of agriculture {{in the world is}} related to the production of animal products. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of crop products with equivalent nutritional value. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is 20 times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. The water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is 1. 5 times larger than for pulses. The unfavorable feed conversion efficiency for animal products is largely responsible for the relatively large water footprint of animal products compared to the crop products. Animal products from industrial systems generally consume and pollute more ground- and surface-water resources than animal products from grazing or mixed systems. The rising global meat consumption and the intensification of animal production systems will put further pressure on the global freshwater resources in the coming decades. The study shows that from a freshwater perspective, animal products from grazing systems have a smaller blue and grey water footprint than products from industrial systems, and that it is more water-efficient to obtain calories, protein and fat through crop products than animal product...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Over {{half the}} world is exposed daily to the smoke from {{combustion}} of solid fuels. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) {{is one of the}} main contributors to the global burden of disease and can be caused by biomass smoke exposure. However, studies of biomass exposure and COPD show a wide range of effect sizes. The aim of this systematic review was to quantify the impact of biomass smoke on the development of COPD and define reasons for differences in the reported effect sizes. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies with sufficient statistical power to calculate the health risk of COPD from the use of solid fuel, which followed standardised criteria for the diagnosis of COPD and which dealt with confounding factors. The results were pooled by fuel <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> to produce summary estimates using a random effects model. Publication bias was also estimated. RESULTS: There were positive associations between the use of solid fuels and COPD (OR= 2. 80, 95 % CI 1. 85 to 4. 0) and chronic bronchitis (OR= 2. 32, 95 % CI 1. 92 to 2. 80). Pooled estimates for different types of fuel show that exposure to wood smoke while performing domestic work presents a greater risk of development of COPD and chronic bronchitis than other fuels. CONCLUSION: Despite heterogeneity across the selected studies, exposure to solid fuel smoke is consistently associated with COPD and chronic bronchitis. Efforts should be made to reduce exposure to solid fuel by using either cleaner fuel or relatively cleaner technology while performing domestic work...|$|E

40|$|Background and Purposes: The {{purposes}} of this meta-analysis were (1) to investigate the relation between prematurity and the parameters of infant kicking, and (2) to examine to what degree the effect size varies {{as a function of}} age, study type, publication <b>type,</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> of origin. Methods: Six studies met all the inclusion criteria and were used for this meta-analysis. A r-indicator was used to represent the effect size indicating the difference between low-risk preterm and full term infants and the difference in kinematic variables between high-risk preterm and full term infants. A fixed-effect model was assumed in this study. To determine whether the r-indicators were derived from a common population, a heterogeneity analysis (Q) was computed for each kinematic variable. Potential moderators (study type, publication type, country of origin, and age) were analyzed for each variable. Results: Overall, there was a consistent moderate to large effect size for intralimb coordination variables between high-risk preterm and full term infants. For other kicking parameters, there was a small effect size between preterm infants (both low-risk and high­ risk groups) and full term infants. From the moderator analyses, studies testing high-risk infants younger than 4 months had a small positive effect for the measures of intralimb coordination, the hip-knee and hip-ankle joint correlations; whereas studies testing infants older than 4 months had a large positive effect on these hip-knee and hip-ankle pairs. On the contrary, studies testing low-risk infants younger than 4 months had a medium positive effect; whereas studies testing low-risk infants older than 4 months showed no effect. Conclusion: The results suggest that intralimb coordination parameters after 4 months of age may be early indicators of atypical coordination since low-risk infants resolved their differences after 4 months of age but high-risk infants sustained the atypical intralimb coordination...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the size-growth relationship for banking and manufacturing firms. In particular it tests the Law of Proportionate Effect (LPE) {{which suggests that}} there is no relationship between firm size and growth. Tests of the LPE are carried out for eight European banking markets (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom) and for three bank types (commercial, co-operative and savings) over the period 1990 to 1994. Employing three measures of size (total assets, equity and off balance sheet business) models are estimated that test for size effects on growth, and the influences of previous growth, bank <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> membership. In the majority of cases, bank growth is independent of bank size, so the LPE holds. However, small banks grew faster than their larger counterparts (in terms of assets and equity) in France, Italy and Spain. The LPE is also investigated for a sample of European manufacturing firms drawn from five countries and eleven industry groups. In contrast to the banking industry there is less evidence that the LPE holds. In most cases small firms grew proportionately faster than their larger counterparts. Using stochastic simulation techniques, the effects of firm growth, entry, exit and merger activity on the evolution of bank sizes and market concentration is examined. Using a simulated industry in which the LPE holds as the benchmark, the implications of various alternative assumptions regarding bank growth were examined. Superimposition of entry leads to a lower mean bank size and lower levels of concentration. Exit leads to higher mean bank size and increased concentration. Mergers lead to increases in mean bank size and concentration in all simulated industries. Using the simulations methodology, hypothetical projections as to the future structure of the banking markets in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK are carried out. Overall, the simulations suggest that bank numbers are likely to decrease in all countries. The market shares of the largest banks are also projected to decline in all countries {{with the exception of the}} UK...|$|E
