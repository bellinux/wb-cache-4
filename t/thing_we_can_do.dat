25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E

The mission of the organization is to promote solutions with elected officials and the general public. The couple states that it supports the Second Amendment while promoting responsible gun ownership and “keeping guns {{out of the hands}} of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill.” Current gun laws allow for private sellers to legally sell guns without a background check, creating a loophole that provides criminals and the mentally ill easy access to guns. Kelly said on Fox News on March 31, 2013, that “any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake, It's the most common sense <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{opened their}} Champions League {{campaign}} with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins {{all in the}} first half extended Arsenal's run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: [...] "We can complain and cry the whole night but that will not change the result. The only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to respond." [...] The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger's decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.|$|E

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

When interviewed, he responded, [...] "Yeah, a top-five is great. To be up front, to lead laps, that's what it's all about. So we'll get these little hiccups polished up and continue plugging forward. That's the only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> is learn from what exactly happened -- was it a cable issue, a battery that was dead, was the alternator not charging?
