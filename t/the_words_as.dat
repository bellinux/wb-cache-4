25|$|A {{reasonably}} {{complete list}} of uncontroversial so-called minimal pairs can be seen below. The two words in each pair are distinguished solely by having different tone (acute vs. grave). In those cases where both words are nouns {{it would have been}} possible to list the genitive forms of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> well, thereby creating another word pair, but this has been avoided. A few word pairs where one of the words is a plural form with the suffix -or have been included. This {{is due to the fact}} that a vast majority of Swedish-speakers in all parts of Sweden pronounce the suffix -or the same way as -er.|$|E
500|$|While {{the words}} [...] "school" [...] and [...] "shoal" [...] have {{different}} meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> synonyms.

[...] "Calma Pueblo" [...] discusses various topics including dishonest politicians, lip-synching in live performances, and payola. Residente also references Calle 13's sponsors with the line [...] "Adidas doesn't use me, I use Adidas." [...] Residente originally wrote eight pages of lyrics for [...] "Calma Pueblo", but later [...] "deleted and deleted" [...] many of <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> <b>as</b> {{he felt that the}} song's subject matter [...] "can come off like cheap pamphleteering. And that's not what I wanted to do." [...] "Digo Lo Que Pienso" [...] has been labeled as a [...] "scathing attack" [...] on San Juan mayor Jorge Santini.|$|E

The analysis of Searle {{in the area}} of declarations, as well as a survey of Lutheran conceptions of <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of promise in both sacrament and Scripture, will evidence specific moments of clarity in Luther’s so-called ‘speech-act’ theology and provide a helpful paradigm for viewing the creative impact of <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>as</b> conceived by Luther...|$|R

500|$|... "Fitter Happier" [...] {{is a short}} musique concrète {{track that}} {{consists}} of sampled musical and background sound and spoken-word lyrics recited by a synthesised voice from the Macintosh SimpleText application. The voice belongs to [...] "Fred", a synthesised voice included with Macintosh computers. Yorke wrote the lyrics [...] "in ten minutes" [...] {{after a period of}} writer's block {{while the rest of the}} band were playing. He described <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> a checklist of slogans for the 1990s, and he considered the lyrics [...] "the most upsetting thing I've ever written", and said it was [...] "liberating" [...] to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is an audio loop from the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor. The band considered using [...] "Fitter Happier" [...] as the album's opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting.|$|E
500|$|The album's art {{design was}} {{credited}} to Capitol's in-house designer, Roy Kohara. Harrison supplied sketches {{for each item}} of the artwork, which adopted a humorous, [...] "wacky" [...] theme throughout the packaging. The vivid-orange front cover featured a die-cut design around the words [...] "EXTRA TEXTURE", through which an inner-sleeve, blue-tinted picture of Harrison was visible. Some vinyl editions presented <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> simple blue text on an orange background, however, doing away with the expensive cut-out detail. In keeping with the album title, the thin cardboard used for the LP cover was similar in texture to the [...] "animal skin used on a football", according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer. The front cover included an Om symbol, positioned below the angled title text and also coloured blue. On {{the back of the}} inner sleeve, there was a second Henry Grossman tour photo of Harrison, clearly enjoying himself on stage.|$|E
500|$|Vaughan Williams' {{program note}} for A Sea Symphony {{discusses}} how the text {{was to be}} treated as music. The composer writes, [...] "The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> well as the music are thus treated symphonically." [...] Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be [...] "pushed about by the music", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.|$|E

Noisey's Daisy Jones interpreted <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> a reference to Australian singer Sia's 2013 single [...] "Elastic Heart", {{who served as the}} executive producer of Daddy Issues. The song continues with the lyrics: [...] "Living for the days, living for the nights, living for the chance to give what's right, now tell me who the hell you think I am." [...] During the song's hook, Candy sings [...] "Why do all the good girls have to die/ Living in a bad girl's paradise"; Yasmeen Gharnit wrote that the section discusses how women must discard their innocence to achieve independence. Other parts include: [...] "Go buy a life that's fantastic cause all you are is your assets” and [...] "You can't buy love without passion / So please don't do nothing drastic".|$|E
500|$|The first {{principle}} {{when deciding}} {{if there is}} certainty of intention {{is the nature of}} the language used; <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> <b>as</b> said in Wright v Atkyns, [...] "must be imperative". Past this, there is no requirement that particular language be used. In Re Kayford, Megarry J held that [...] "it is well settled that a trust can be created without using the word [...] "trust" [...] or [...] "confidence" [...] or the like; the question is whether in substance a sufficient intention to create a trust has been manifested". In Paul v Constance, [...] it was held that the phrase [...] "the money is as much yours as it is mine" [...] was sufficient to translate to a trust. A trust will not be formed if it is clear that some other intention was there, such as the intention to make a pure gift, as in Jones v Lock. Historically, precatory words such as [...] "it is hoped" [...] and [...] "it is desired" [...] were held to be valid. Since Lambe v Eames, the courts have instead taken the approach that the circumstances and the reading of the statement as a whole are the factors, and that no particular words will impose a trust on their own.|$|E
500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all I {{have to do is}} think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps unsurprisingly, the {{ambiguity}} of the phrase {{has the potential to}} offend; some right-wing circles in Japan have interpreted <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> an admission of guiltimplicitly reading it as [...] "we (the Japanese people) shall not repeat the error"and they criticize the epitaph as a self-accusation by the Japanese empire.

The Xu bronzes from Shaoxing in the Yue kingdom, however, can reliably identified with exiles. Its donor, Yin, had been the yaoyin (official in charge of sacrifice) of Xu, and stated on one ding his ambitions to restore his home state. An inscription on a halberd of a king of Yue is even interpreted by some scholars as [...] "to aid the Xu state", {{in which case the}} Yue government itself desired the restoration of Xu. This interpretation is, however, strongly disputed, with many scholars such as Peng Yushang reading <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> the name of the king.|$|E
2500|$|Line 10 is {{the source}} of some dissent amongst scholars. One reading is that, {{compared}} to his physical offspring (“this”), the depictions of time's pencil or the poet's novice pen ("pupil") are ineffectual. But it is the potential insight into the sonnets' chronology, through the relationship of [...] "this" [...] to [...] "Time's pencil" [...] and [...] "my pupil pen", that is the focus of the debate: George Steevens regards <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> evidence Shakespeare wrote his sonnets as a youth; for T. W. Baldwin the phrase connects this sonnet to The Rape of Lucrece. While in general terms [...] "Time" [...] is in this line a form of artist (rather than a destroyer, as elsewhere in the cycle), its exact function is unclear. In Shakespeare's time, a pencil was both a small painter's brush and a tool to engrave letters, although graphite pencils bound in wax, string or even wood were known in the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{referred}} to with the accompanying parenthetical title [...] "(Krishna, Where Are You?)", [...] "I Am Missing You" [...] {{is a love}} song dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna. In the choruses, Shankar's words mourn the apparent absence of Krishna from his life, but in the repeated verses he acknowledges: [...] "Though I can't see you / I hear your flute all the while." [...] The latter line reflects {{the importance of the}} flute – or bansuri – in the Hindu tradition, since it is the musical instrument most commonly associated with the deity. In his second autobiography, Raga Mala (1997), Shankar describes <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a simple lyric that just gushed out of me when I was travelling on a plane". Speaking to journalist Graham Reid in 1998, Shankar recalled: [...] "I think we were travelling somewhere in the States … it was very short, maybe six or eight lines. It came very spontaneously with the tune and I noted it down." [...] In addition to the lyrics being in English rather than Hindi or Bengali, the latter being Shankar's first language, the song's melody follows Western convention, with distinct chord changes instead of the single-chord, monodic drone common to Indian music.|$|E
