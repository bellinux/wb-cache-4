5|$|Viewed from {{underneath}} {{between the two}} lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe. The cerebellum rests {{at the back of}} the cranial cavity, lying beneath the occipital lobes, and is separated from these by the cerebellar <b>tentorium,</b> a sheet of fibre.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar <b>tentorium,</b> where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E
25|$|Each {{transverse}} sinus passes lateralward and forward, {{describing a}} slight curve with its convexity upward, {{to the base}} of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and lies, in this part of its course, in the attached margin of the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli; it then leaves the <b>tentorium</b> and curves downward and medialward (an area sometimes referred to as the sigmoid sinus) to reach the jugular foramen, where it ends in the internal jugular vein.|$|E
25|$|The sinus {{runs in the}} {{attached}} margin of the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli, in a groove in the petrous part {{of the temporal bone}} formed by the sinus itself - the superior petrosal sulcus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tentorium</b> is an {{extension}} of the dura mater that separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum. There are two major classes of herniation: supratentorial and infratentorial. Supratentorial refers to herniation of structures normally found above the tentorial notch, and infratentorial refers to structures normally found below it.|$|E
25|$|A second complex has small, compact shells {{covered with}} numerous, minute pustules or points, the shells often white or {{scarcely}} patterned, with only moderately expanded outer lips. This group {{occurs in the}} lowlands on the southeastern coast from Santo Domingo to the easternmost portion of the island and north to the Samaná Peninsula. It consists of Abbottella milleacantha, Abbottella aenea, Abbottella <b>tentorium,</b> Abbottella urbana, Abbottella crossei, and Abbottella calliotropis.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypopharynx}} is {{a median}} lobe immediately behind the mouth, projecting forwards {{from the back}} of the preoral cavity; it is a lobe of uncertain origin, but perhaps associated with the mandibular segment; in apterygotes, earwigs, and nymphal mayflies, the hypopharynx bears a pair of lateral lobes, the superlinguae (singular: superlingua). It divides the cavity into a dorsal food pouch, or cibarium, and a ventral salivarium into which the salivary duct opens. It is commonly found fused to the libium. Most of the hypopharynx is membranous, but the adoral face is sclerotized distally, and proximally contains a pair of suspensory sclerites extending upwards to end in the lateral wall of the stomodeum. Muscles arising on the frons are inserted into these sclerites, which distally are hinged to a pair of lingual sclerites. These, in turn, have inserted into them antagonistic pairs of muscles arising on the <b>tentorium</b> and labium. The various muscles serve to swing the hypopharynx forwards and back, and in the cockroach, two more muscles run across the hypopharynx and dilate the salivary orifice and expand the salivarium.|$|E
500|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is located}} in the posterior cranial fossa. The fourth ventricle, pons and medulla are in front of the cerebellum. It is separated from the overlying cerebrum by a layer of leathery dura mater, the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli; all of its connections with other parts of the brain travel through the pons. Anatomists classify the cerebellum as part of the metencephalon, which also includes the pons; the metencephalon is {{the upper part of the}} rhombencephalon or [...] "hindbrain". Like the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum is divided into two hemispheres; it also contains a narrow midline zone (the vermis). A set of large folds is, by convention, used to divide the overall structure into 10 smaller [...] "lobules". Because of its large number of tiny granule cells, the cerebellum contains more neurons than the total from the rest of the brain, but takes up only 10% of the total brain volume. The number of neurons in the cerebellum is related to the number of neurons in the neocortex. There are about 3.6 times as many neurons in the cerebellum as in the neocortex, a ratio that is conserved across many different mammalian species.|$|E
2500|$|In uncal herniation, {{a common}} subtype of transtentorial herniation, the {{innermost}} {{part of the}} temporal lobe, the uncus, can be squeezed {{so much that it}} moves towards the <b>tentorium</b> and puts pressure on the brainstem, most notably the midbrain. The <b>tentorium</b> is a structure within the skull formed by the dura mater of the meninges. [...] Tissue may be stripped from the cerebral cortex in a process called decortication.|$|E
2500|$|Subdural hematomas occur {{most often}} around the tops {{and sides of}} the frontal and parietal lobes. They also occur in the {{posterior}} cranial fossa, and near the falx cerebri and <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli. [...] Unlike epidural hematomas, which cannot expand past the sutures of the skull, subdural hematomas can expand along {{the inside of the}} skull, creating a concave shape that follows the curve of the brain, stopping only at the dural reflections like the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli and falx cerebri.|$|E
2500|$|Increased {{pressure}} in the posterior fossa can cause the cerebellum to move up through the tentorial opening in upward, or cerebellar herniation. [...] The midbrain is pushed through the tentorial notch. This also pushes the midbrain down. This {{is also known as}} a transtentorial herniation since it occurs across the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli.|$|E
2500|$|In central herniation, the {{diencephalon}} {{and parts}} of the temporal lobes of both of the cerebral hemispheres are squeezed through a notch in the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli. [...] Transtentorial herniation can occur when the brain moves either up or down across the <b>tentorium,</b> called ascending and descending transtentorial herniation respectively; however descending herniation is much more common. [...] Downward herniation can stretch branches of the basilar artery (pontine arteries), causing them to tear and bleed, known as a Duret hemorrhage. The result is usually fatal. Other symptoms of this type of herniation include small, dilated, fixed pupils with paralysis of upward eye movement giving the characteristic appearance of [...] "sunset eyes". Also found in these patients, often as a terminal complication is the development of diabetes insipidus due to the compression of the pituitary stalk. [...] Radiographically, downward herniation is characterized by obliteration of the suprasellar cistern from temporal lobe herniation into the tentorial hiatus with associated compression on the cerebral peduncles. [...] Upwards herniation, on the other hand, can be radiographically characterized by obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern. Intracranial hypotension syndrome has been known to mimic downwards transtentorial herniation.|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{herniation}} is {{a potentially}} deadly {{side effect of}} very high pressure within the skull that occurs when {{a part of the}} brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain). [...] Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.|$|E
2500|$|On a CT scan, {{subdural}} hematomas are classically crescent-shaped, with a {{concave surface}} {{away from the}} skull. [...] However, {{they can have a}} convex appearance, especially in the early stage of bleeding. [...] This may cause difficulty in distinguishing between subdural and epidural hemorrhages. [...] A more reliable indicator of subdural hemorrhage is its involvement of a larger portion of the cerebral hemisphere since it can cross suture lines, unlike an epidural hemorrhage. [...] Subdural blood can also be seen as a layering density along the <b>tentorium</b> cerebelli. This can be a chronic, stable process, since the feeding system is low-pressure. In such cases, subtle signs of bleeding such as effacement of sulci or medial displacement of the junction between gray matter and white matter may be apparent. [...] A chronic bleed can be the same density as brain tissue (called isodense to brain), meaning that it will show up on CT scan as the same shade as brain tissue, potentially obscuring the finding.|$|E
2500|$|Situated {{beneath the}} mandibles, paired maxillae {{manipulate}} food during mastication. Maxillae can have hairs and [...] "teeth" [...] along their inner margins. At the outer margin, the galea is a cupped or scoop-like structure, which sits over {{the outer edge}} of the labium. They also have palps, which are used to sense the characteristics of potential foods. The maxillae occupy a lateral position, one on each side of the head behind the mandibles. The proximal part of the maxilla consists of a basal cardo, which has a single articulation with the head, and a flat plate, the stipes, hinged to the cardo. Both cardo and stipes are loosely joined to the head by membrane so they are capable of movement. Distally on the stipes are two lobes, an inner lacinea and an outer galea, one or both of which may be absent. More laterally on the stipes is a jointed, leglike palp made up of a number of segments; in Orthoptera there are five. Anterior and posterior rotator muscles are inserted on the cardo, and ventral adductor muscles arising on the <b>tentorium</b> are inserted on both cardo and stipes. Arising in the stipes are flexor muscles of lacinea and galea and another lacineal flexor arises in the cranium, but neither the lacinea nor the galea has an extensor muscle. The palp has levator and depressor muscles arising in the stipes, and each segment of the palp has a single muscle causing flexion of the next segment.|$|E

6000|$|In such a mammal as a Beaver (Fig. 29), a line ('a b'.) {{drawn through}} the bones, termed basioccipital, basisphenoid, and presphenoid, is very long in {{proportion}} to the extreme length of the cavity which contains the cerebral hemispheres ('g h'.).

The sharper definition of the lower edge of the cast of the cerebral chamber in the Chimpanzee arises from the circumstance that the <b>tentorium</b> remained in that skull {{and not in the}} Man's. The cast more accurately represents the brain in Chimpanzee than in the Man; and the great backward projection of the posterior lobes of the cerebrum of the former, beyond the cerebellum, is conspicuous.] ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the lower}} placental mammals, the {{cerebral}} hemispheres leave the proper upper and posterior {{face of the}} cerebellum completely visible, when the brain is viewed from above; but, in the higher forms, the hinder part of each hemisphere, separated only by the <b>tentorium</b> (p. 281) from the anterior face of the cerebellum, inclines backwards and downwards, and grows out, as the so-called [...] "posterior lobe," [...] so as at length to overlap and hide the cerebellum. In all Mammals, each cerebral hemisphere contains a cavity which is termed the 'ventricle,' and as this ventricle is prolonged, on the one hand, forwards, {{and on the other}} downwards, into the substance of the hemisphere, it is said to have two horns or 'cornua, an 'anterior cornu,' and a 'descending cornu.' When the posterior lobe is well developed, a third prolongation of the ventricular cavity extends into it, and is called the [...] "posterior cornu." ...|$|E
60|$|This groove, therefore, {{indicates}} {{the line of}} separation between {{that part of the}} cranial cavity which contains the cerebrum, and that which contains the cerebellum; and as the brain exactly fills the cavity of the skull, {{it is obvious that the}} relations of these two parts of the cranial cavity at once informs us of the relations of their contents. Now in man, in all the old-world, and in all the new-world Simiae, with one exception, when the face is directed forwards, this line of attachment of the <b>tentorium,</b> or impression for the lateral sinus, as it is technically called, is nearly horizontal, and the cerebral chamber invariably overlaps or projects behind the cerebellar chamber. In the Howler Monkey or 'Mycetes' (see Fig. 16), the line passes obliquely upwards and backwards, and the cerebral overlap is almost nil; while in the Lemurs, as in the lower mammals, the line is much more inclined in the same direction, and the cerebellar chamber projects considerably beyond the cerebral.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time after}} the {{publication}} of the translation of Professor Schaaffhausen's Memoir, I was led to study the cast of the Neanderthal cranium with more attention than I had previously bestowed upon it, in consequence of wishing to supply Sir Charles Lyell with a diagram, exhibiting the special peculiarities of this skull, as compared with other human skulls. In order to do this it was necessary to identify, with precision, those points in the skulls compared which corresponded anatomically. Of these points, the glabella was obvious enough; but when I had distinguished another, defined by the occipital protuberance and superior semicircular line, and had placed the outline of the Neanderthal skull against that of the Engis skull, in such a position that the glabella and occipital protuberance of both were intersected by the same straight line, the difference was so vast and the flattening of the Neanderthal skull so prodigious (compare Figs. 22 and 24, A.), that I at first imagined I must have fallen into some error. And I was the more inclined to suspect this, as, in ordinary human skulls, the occipital protuberance and superior semicircular curved line on the exterior of the occiput correspond pretty closely with the 'lateral sinuses' and the line of attachment of the <b>tentorium</b> internally. But on the <b>tentorium</b> rests, as I have said in the preceding Essay, the posterior lobe of the brain; and hence, the occipital protuberance, and the curved line in question, indicate, approximately, the lower limits of that lobe. Was it possible for a human being to have the brain thus flattened and depressed; or, on the other hand, had the muscular ridges shifted their position? In order to solve these doubts, and to decide the question whether the great supraciliary projections did, or did not, arise from the development of the frontal sinuses, I requested Sir Charles Lyell to be so good as to obtain for me from Dr. Fuhlrott, the possessor of the skull, answers to certain queries, and if possible a cast, or at any rate drawings, or photographs, of the interior of the skull.|$|E
60|$|Professor Owen {{repeated}} his erroneous assertions {{at the meeting}} of the British Association in 1861, and again, without any obvious necessity, and without adducing a single new fact or new argument, or being able in any way to meet the crushing evidence from original dissections of numerous Apes' brains, which had in the meanwhile been brought forward by Prof. Rolleston,* ([Footnote] *On the Affinities of the Brain of the Orang.
