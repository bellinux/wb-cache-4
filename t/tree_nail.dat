50|$|From 2006 to 2009 the Onrust Project, a {{non-profit}} organization, directed by Don Rittner and Greta Wagle, built {{a replica of}} the Onrust at the Schenectady County Historical Society's Mabee Farm Historic Site in Rotterdam Junction, NY. Master shipwright and naval architect Gerald DeWeerdt of the Netherlands, and shipwright Howard Mittleman of North River Restorations in Schenectady, N.Y. led the team of volunteers. Construction used both modern power tools and traditional hand tools to build the ship, employing authentic 17th century Dutch ship building techniques rediscovered by ship archeologists in the Netherlands. The material is mostly white oak with pine decking, most of which was sawn nearby by one of the volunteers. The replica is held together by more than 4,000 hand-made black locust <b>tree</b> <b>nails</b> called trunnels and iron rivets. Much of the metal fittings and rivets were hand-made by local blacksmiths of wrought iron; others, as well as cannon, use authentic bronze.|$|R
5000|$|Raoul Hynckes ( [...] Brussels , 11 May 1893 - Blaricum , 19 January 1973 [...] ) was a Dutch {{painter of}} Belgian origin.The style of Hynckes was {{initially}} impressionistic, {{but in the}} thirties {{of the last century}} he began allegorical still lifes to paint in a very realistic manner and in an extremely fine and meticulous painting style (withered <b>trees,</b> old <b>nails,</b> skulls). He is counted among the magical realists [...] Regularly he also worked as bookbinding designer and poster designer.Hynckes gained further fame through his autobiographical writings [...] "Friends of Midnight", appeared in the series Private Domain.|$|R
60|$|About {{this time}} Miriam's grandmother, {{who lived in}} a tiny cottage in Woodlinton, fell ill, and the girl was sent to keep house. It was a {{beautiful}} little place. The cottage had a big garden in front, with red brick walls, against which the plum <b>trees</b> were <b>nailed.</b> At the back another garden was separated from the fields by a tall old hedge. It was very pretty. Miriam had not much to do, so she found time for her beloved reading, and for writing little introspective pieces which interested her.|$|R
50|$|According to Francisco Javier Durán García, New York City based {{instrument}} maker, {{the traditional}} art of güira making involves a <b>tree</b> stump, hammer, <b>nail,</b> metal tube, and wood block. The instrument is hand fashioned from sheet metal into a (roughly 13") long cylindrical tube along with repeatedly-dimpled (not fully perforated) tubular (exterior) surface.|$|R
50|$|Romanus of Samosata (died 297) was {{a martyr}} for Christianity in Syria in 297. He and his companions, Jacob, Philotheus, Hyperechius, Abibus, Julianus, and Paregorius were all {{subject to a}} variety of tortures before being hanged to <b>trees</b> and then <b>nailed</b> against them. They are {{mentioned}} in the Menaea Graeca and the Menologium der Orthodox-Katholischen Kirche des Morgenlandes. Their feast day is January 29.|$|R
50|$|The mosque {{combines}} several architectural styles {{from the}} Chinese, Thais, and the Malays. The mosque was built with wood from the hummingbird tree and an ironwood <b>tree.</b> Because <b>nails</b> weren’t invented at that time, wedges were used instead {{to hold the}} wood into place. Original roofing was made of palm tree leaves and it was later changed to terracotta tiles. The mosque consists of two buildings. The smaller building is where the mihrab is located and has three layers of roof. It is also where the Chinese-style minaret is located. The bigger building has more of Thai architectural influence with the Thai-style gable. The walls of both buildings has etchings of Thai/Chinese/Malay designs and patterns.|$|R
60|$|It was a nook in {{a rustic}} by-road, which {{the genius of}} Mopes had laid waste as completely, {{as if he had}} been born an Emperor and a Conqueror. Its centre object was a dwelling-house, {{sufficiently}} substantial, all the window-glass of which had been long ago abolished by the surprising genius of Mopes, and all the windows of which were barred across with rough-split logs of <b>trees</b> <b>nailed</b> over them on the outside. A rickyard, hip-high in vegetable rankness and ruin, contained outbuildings from which the thatch had lightly fluttered away, on all the winds of all the seasons of the year, and from which the planks and beams had heavily dropped and rotted. The frosts and damps of winter, and the heats of summer, had warped what wreck remained, so that not a post or a board retained the position it was meant to hold, but everything was twisted from its purpose, like its owner, and degraded and debased. In this homestead of the sluggard, behind the ruined hedge, and sinking away among the ruined grass and the nettles, were the last perishing fragments of certain ricks: which had gradually mildewed and collapsed, until they looked like mounds of rotten honeycomb, or dirty sponge. Tom Tiddler's ground could even show its ruined water; for, there was a slimy pond into which a tree or two had fallen--one soppy trunk and branches lay across it then--which in its accumulation of stagnant weed, and in its black decomposition, and in all its foulness and filth, was almost comforting, regarded as the only water that could have reflected the shameful place without seeming polluted by that low office.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, Manser and {{his friend}} Jacques Christinet {{travelled}} to Brunei and swam across the 300-metre wide Limbang river at night. Manser's friend was almost fatally injured by drifting logs along the river. They spent 3 weeks in Sarawak hiding from the police. During that time period, they attempted to order four tons of 25-centimeter nails for the Penan tribe to hammer into the <b>tree</b> trunks. These <b>nails</b> could have caused serious injuries to the loggers when the embedded nails inevitably {{came into contact with}} chainsaws.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, plastic, {{metal or}} even {{sometimes}} wooden markers may be affixed to <b>trees,</b> usually with <b>nails.</b> These {{last longer than}} paint, but are vulnerable to both the chewing of animals (porcupines especially) {{and the growth of}} the tree, which causes the marker to fall off. To protect against this possibility, most markers are put on with some space between the head and the bark. The placement of markers requires more skill and labor than paint, as well as an area with an abundant supply of trees to which to attach them.|$|R
50|$|Kimco began {{demolition}} on {{the mall}} in summer of 2004. The mall's anchor stores were all left standing, as was a Secretary of State office next to Target. After demolition was complete, a new strip mall called Maple Hill Pavilion was built connecting the remaining spaces. GNC, Regis, Dollar <b>Tree</b> and Glamour <b>Nails</b> all opened new locations in the strip. Since {{the opening of the}} strip mall, PetSmart, Rue 21, Pier One Imports, GameStop and DSW Shoe Warehouse have also opened. In 2006, the Value City Furniture store was renamed Rooms Today. It was again named Value City Furniture.|$|R

5000|$|In the 18th century, {{a custom}} {{developed}} that travelling smiths and apprentices would hammer a <b>nail</b> into the <b>tree</b> trunk; in particular, from 1715 on, [...] travelling journeyman locksmiths. The reason {{for doing so}} before then is unknown; however, {{it is unlikely to}} have been a craft guild custom in the beginning, because the Stock im Eisen is significantly older. [...] "Nail trees" [...] are well known in Southeastern Europe and are found in many cities in Hungary, Romania (in Transylvania) and other countries of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire; the Vienna Stock im Eisen is the oldest preserved <b>nail</b> <b>tree.</b> The custom persisted until the late 19th century, and inspired the [...] "men of iron" [...] statues that were used for propaganda and fund-raising in Germany and Austria in World War I, particularly the tree set up in Freiburg.|$|R

50|$|Yuka is a {{style of}} Cuban music and dance and a type of drum, of Congolese origin. The word Yuka is Bantu, and means 'to beat'. For preference, the drums are made from hollowed-out trunks of the avocado <b>tree.</b> Leather is <b>nailed</b> {{to one of the}} open ends, and the player hits the skin with both hands, the drum being slanted between his legs. The drums come in three sizes: caja (large), mula and cachimba (a term {{referring}} to its small size). Rhythms may also be played on the drum body, the drummer using a small mallet or a stave in one hand, the other hand slapping the leather. The drummer wears two small rattles (nkembí), made of metal or gourds, on his wrists. The drums may be accompanied by staves on a guagua (hollow wooden slit drum) or the drum body, and by percussion on a piece of iron, the muela (a pick used for plowing).|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{injunctions}} vary {{in their}} gravity and source in Bamunka. We have the Kwifon sign of Injunction, the Gueiteh sign of injunction, the Goeh sign of injunction, Nyi or god sign of injunction by quarter heads and the commoner's sign of injunction. Incidentally the quarter-head's sign of injunction {{is the same as}} the sign for peace in Bamunka as well as the sign for Bamunka traditional gods called [...] "Nyi". An injunction indicates that the person enjoined has failed to obey the community one way or another and that by the injunction he is required without failure to report with the injunction to his quarter-head who should explain to him what the penalty is or where to go to perform his task. Injunctions are delivered in varying ways. Where there is pregnant woman in the compound of the enjoined the injunction is tired to a <b>tree</b> and <b>nailed</b> on a cut plantain stem instead of on the ground in the yard as is the normal practice. When all members of an entire household fail to perform communal labor, the injunction is nailed at the middle of the yard and until all of them carry out the task or pay the fine, the injunction is not removed and the persons enjoined cannot perform even their job without first performing the communal labor. In the case of any doubt, the right place to go to the quarter-head who should either solve the problem or direct the enjoined to where he should go to have his problem resolved.|$|R
6000|$|Although I lie so low {{and still}} [...] Here came I by the Master's will; [...] He smote {{at last to}} make me free, [...] As He was smitten on the <b>tree</b> [...] And <b>nailèd</b> there.
