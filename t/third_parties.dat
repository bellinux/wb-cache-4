40|$|Decisions to {{cooperate}} are often delegated to a <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> We examined whether cooperation differs when {{decisions are made}} for a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> compared with ourselves and specified which motives are important for third-party cooperation. Participants played multiple rounds of a public goods game (PGG). In Study 1, we varied personal involvement from high to low; participants played for themselves (Self), for themselves and a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> (Shared), and solely for a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> (<b>Third</b> <b>Party).</b> Participants contributed most when personal involvement was lowest (i. e., <b>Third</b> <b>Party)</b> and least when personal involvement was high (i. e., Self). Study 2 explored if social motives underlie third-party cooperation by comparing cooperation with social (human) and non-social (computer) group members. Reducing personal involvement in the PGG (i. e., <b>Third</b> <b>Party)</b> increased cooperation in social contexts compared with non-social contexts, indicating enhanced collective interest. Increased cooperation for a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may result from taking the other's perspective, thereby increasing social norm preferences...|$|R

5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave in certain ways, made by <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
50|$|If {{an agent}} does not {{disclose}} to a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{that he is}} acting as agent, and concludes {{a contract with the}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{as if he were the}} principal in the transaction, the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may treat the contract as binding on the agent. The <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may sue the agent, as principal, on the contract; equally the agent may, as principal, sue the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on the contract. When, however, the undisclosed principal discovers that the contract that he in fact authorised has been concluded, he may adopt it, and may consequently sue the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> on it. Equally, the <b>third</b> <b>party,</b> on discovering the undisclosed principal, may sue the principal on the contract. it follows that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> has a choice or an election to sue either the agent or the undisclosed principal, when discovered; but having elected to sue one of them the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is debarred from suing the other, even if he or she sues the agent before being aware that there is a principal. The <b>third</b> <b>party</b> may be sued on the contract by either the principal or agent, but not by both, the principal having the preferential right to do so.|$|R
50|$|Impleader is a {{procedural}} device before trial {{in which one}} <b>party</b> joins a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> into a lawsuit because that <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is liable to an original defendant. Using the vocabulary of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the defendant seeks to become a third-party plaintiff by filing a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> complaint against a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> not presently party to the lawsuit, who thereby becomes a third-party defendant. This complaint alleges that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is liable for {{all or part of}} the damages that the original plaintiff may win from the original defendant.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{logistics}} providers in Sweden and their service offerings. The author examines, evaluate {{and discuss the}} range of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics services provided by <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics companies in Sweden. Furthermore, the author categorized the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers using some of proposed frameworks and theories for differentiating <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers from previous researchers. This was done to determine the relevant categories that the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers in Sweden belongs to. Moreover, the author made {{a comparison of the}} competence of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers {{in terms of the number}} of services they offer in Sweden. The author used the qualitative research approach as the thesis is more exploratory in nature. Basically, exploratory research is conducted to obtain greater understanding of a concept or to help clarify ambiguous problem. The author interview four (4) <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers in Sweden and other information such as the provider’s website information and annual reports was used in the analysis. It is interesting to note that, relationship between <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers and their customer is a major factor when classifying providers into different category. Some of the theories proposed by previous researcher on the classification of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics provider have become obsolete due to the fact that the relationship between the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers and their customers has evolve over the years from formal cooperation to strategic alliance and joint ownership. Some of the companies are less competent than others in terms of the services they offer in each of the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics service categories. This does not necessarily make them weaker because the services they offer in each of the categories are being driven by the company’s business strategy to stay competitive in the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics industry. Furthermore, although size and global status give some competitive advantages, adopting different strategies such as creating a niche market in a particular service or a particular industry will provide major competitive advantages to <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics providers...|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be able to claim providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd, (Baxter) was a {{decision}} of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited, a tenderer for various government contracts, was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA, Australian legislation governing anti-competitive behaviour) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts.

5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{believe that}} Caragiale's ultimate relocation to Germany {{was at least}} in part prompted by the Caion affair.

In his speech of 1902, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea openly accused Caion of forging historical records during his stint at Noua Revistă Română. More than fifty years after the fact, Ștefan Cazimir discovered that the poems Caion claimed to have authored, and which Caragiale found especially entertaining, were in fact poor-quality translations from Charles Baudelaire.|$|E
