40|$|The {{persistent}} {{demand for}} sustainable and eco – friendly fibres {{able to achieve}} high performance materials drew the attention to bast fibres, which, in this regard, represent an attractive resource. They are characterised by their fineness, flexibility, and excellent tensile properties due to the cellulose volume fraction. In particular, the fibre of the Himalayan giant nettle plant (Girardinia diversifolia), which grows in Africa and Asia, simultaneously provides social and environmental benefits as well as attractive physical properties, making it an interesting fibre for high performance sustainable textiles. This research provides an unprecedented investigation on giant Himalayan nettle fibres, currently processed and used in the handicraft, performed in parallel with common European nettle fibre (Urtica dioica) already used in the textile industry. The morphological, physical, and mechanical characterisation of G. diversifolia fibres provide encouraging results, indicating a substantial superiority (in terms of physical and mechanical properties) of Himalayan nettle fibres compared to the most common <b>textile</b> <b>bast</b> <b>fibres.</b> Himalayan nettle fibres displayed higher tensile strength, tensile modulus, and elongation at break with respect to European nettle fibres. Furthermore, the Himalayan nettle fibre is the longest bast fibre known so far. Its moisture content results indicate effective dielectric insulating capacity. The values of moisture regain, inferior to cotton, show that the fibre physical characteristics are not affect by humidity. Treatment with increasing concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) {{was carried out in}} order to induce changes in the molecular structure, from Cellulose I to Cellulose II, of both Himalayan and European nettle fibres, and to assess how this variation could influence their physical and mechanical characteristics. This research has identified as best result the fibre versatility: the ability to obtain, with alkaline treatment, characteristics of the fibre able to meet different purposes. To make the fibre attractive for the textile industry, Himalayan nettle fibre has to be competitive demonstrating that it can work in technical textiles. The field of outdoor sportswear, where a high level of comfort is required, has been chosen to demonstrate the performance of the Himalayan nettle fibre hypothesising a multilayer fabric made of three Himalayan nettle nonwovens treated at three different concentrations of NaOH. Based on its superior fibre length and mechanical strength, Himalayan giant nettle fibre could be a very promising material for advanced nonwovens where high – performance materials are required...|$|E
40|$|In plants {{there is}} no {{universal}} protocol for RNA extraction, since optimizations are required depending on the species, tissues and developmental stages. Some plants/tissues are rich in secondary metabolites or synthesize thick cell walls, which hinder an efficient RNA extraction. One such example is <b>bast</b> <b>fibres,</b> long extraxylary cells characterized by a thick cellulosic cell wall. Given the economic importance of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres,</b> which {{are used in the}} textile sector, as well as in biocomposites as green substitutes of glass fibres, it is desirable to better understand their development from a molecular point of view.

5000|$|<b>Bast</b> <b>fibre</b> (also called phloem fibre or skin fibre) is plant fibre {{collected}} from the phloem (the [...] "inner bark", sometimes called [...] "skin") or bast surrounding the stem of certain dicotyledonous plants.

Some of the economically important <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance flax, hemp, or ramie, but also <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> from wild plants, as stinging nettle, and trees such as lime or linden, wisteria, and mulberry {{have been used in}} the past. <b>Bast</b> <b>fibres</b> are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{eco-friendly}} apparel and technical textiles {{has led to}} a resurgence of interests in <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> such as hemp. The lack of fast and objective evaluation of the quality attributes of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> has been a major barrier to the advancement of the <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> industry. One of the most important quality attributes of a fibre is its fineness. For <b>bast</b> <b>fibres,</b> the fibre fineness measurement can also reflect the degree of fibre separation during retting or degumming. The traditional method of evaluating the fineness and residual gum content of <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> is a very tedious process. In this paper, degummed hemp fibres have been measured for fineness on an Optical Fibre Diameter Analyser (OFDA), and the results have been co-related with the residual gum content in the fibre samples. Since hemp fibres do not have a circular cross section, it is the width of the fibre that gets measured by the OFDA instrument, and this width has been used as an indication of the fibre fineness in this paper. The findings from this study suggest that the optical method can provide a fast and objective way of evaluating the fineness of hemp fibres, {{and that there is a}} good correlation between the fibre „width‟ measurement and the residual gum content. <br /...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{valuable}} fibres {{are located in}} the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material ("woody core"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often <b>bast</b> <b>fibres</b> have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), ropes, yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap.

40|$|<b>Bast</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced, {{unsaturated}} polyester matrix composites were fabricated using non-woven mats of hemp or jute fibre as reinforcement. Composites were also prepared using {{chopped strand mat}} glass fibre as reinforcement. The short-term mechanical properties of the laminates were assessed. It was observed that at equivalent fibre volume fractions the stiffness of the glass fibre reinforced material only marginally exceeded that of the two, unmodified <b>bast</b> <b>fibre,</b> reinforced materials. At equivalent fibre volume fractions, however, {{the strength of the}} glass fibre reinforced composite was found to be significantly greater than that of the <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced materials. It was noted that in the <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced composites, the onset of non-linear behaviour occurred at relatively low applied stresses. Work of fracture in static three-point flexure and Charpy impact strength tests, indicated that the toughness of the plant fibre reinforced material was as much as an order of magnitude less than that of the glass fibre reinforced material. Fracture mechanics techniques were used to further quantify toughness and confirmed this to be so. Furthermore, these tests indicated that the microstructure of the <b>bast</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced material should be examined more closely. Microscopy conducted on the fibres revealed that these were often subject to extensive micro-compressive damage. It was postulated that uneven fibre straining characteristics could lead to compromised interfacial properties, which might in turn detrimentally affect the macroscopic behaviour of the composite. A technique known as half fringe photoelasticity was used to investigate the stress-field in the matrix surrounding the fibre defects. It was observed that not only did concentrations of stress occur in the vicinity of these, but also that the shear stress distribution {{along the length of the}} fibre was interrupted by the presence of the defects.
