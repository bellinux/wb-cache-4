25|$|Essentially, amplifying an {{electric}} violin {{is exactly the}} same as amplifying a guitar. They both produce an audio output which is transferred through an audio cable into an amp or PA. For this reason, there are few amps that are specifically for violin, and even <b>those</b> <b>can</b> be repurposed for guitar. Most electric violinists use standard guitar amplifiers. The advantage with using guitar amps is that they have been used for years and their sound is reliable, though not all guitar amps will give a desired tone. Some prefer the more mellow tone of tube amps over solid state amps and digital PA's for violins.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{cognitive}} {{responses in}} the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will begin to feel that anything and everything they do is not enough to keep their unfaithful partner from straying which in turn makes them feel incompetent. They may feel incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to change their behavior in hopes of keeping or getting their partner’s attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with (Johnson, 2017). People cheat for many reasons and each of <b>those</b> <b>can</b> cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner’s actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner’s actions. The accuser begins to anticipate feeling rejected by their significant other, therefore, they have resentful cognitive responses towards the accused.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unique and}} {{realistic}} portraits in the Boyana Church {{are considered to}} be forerunners of the Renaissance. The wall piers and the arches were often decorated with medallion-shaped bust images of saints. Magnificent examples of <b>those</b> <b>can</b> be observed in SS Peter and Paul Church in Tarnovo. Along with the traditional scenes such as [...] "Christ's passions" [...] and [...] "Feast cycle" [...] in the second layer; [...] "Christ Pantokrator" [...] in the dome and the Madonna with the infant Christ in the apse, there were also specific images and scenes. In the narthex of the [...] SS. Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo there were frescoes of St Anna nursing the infant Mary and St Elisabeth nursing the infant John the Baptist, unfortunately the last one did not survive. The iconographic type Galaktotrophousa was a predecessor of the widely-spread images of Madonna with the infant Christ in Western Europe. Although it was canonical, that scene was rarely used in the Byzantine Iconography. In the 35 calendar scenes from the same church some of the characters were painted with contemporary garments. The large number of images of Jesus Christ in the Boyana Church makes an impression: Pantokrator (All-powerful); Emmanuel (Young man); Evergetes (Blessing); Mandilion; Keramidion and the unique image Christ Ancient of Days in which He is depicted as a white-bearded Old man.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{orthodox}} scholars often {{cite the}} poems in the First Folio as evidence for Shakespeare, such as Jonson's introductory poem describing the engraved portrait as having [...] "hit his face" [...] well, his eulogy that calls Shakespeare [...] "sweet Swan of Avon", and Digges's line {{that refers to}} when [...] "Time dissolves thy Stratford monument". Yet Marlovians say <b>those</b> <b>can</b> each be interpreted in quite different ways. The [...] "face", according to the Oxford English Dictionary (10.a) could mean an [...] "outward show; assumed or factitious appearance; disguise, pretence". When he writes of [...] "Swan of Avon" [...] we may choose to take it as meaning the Avon that runs through Stratford, or we may think of Daniel's Delia, addressed to {{the mother of the}} First Folio's two dedicatees, in which he refers to the Wiltshire one where they all lived:But Avon rich in fame, though poor in waters,Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat.And when Digges writes [...] "And Time dissolves thy Stratford monument", one Marlovian argument says that it is quite reasonable to assume that he is really saying that Time will eventually [...] "solve, resolve or explain" [...] it (O.E.D. 12), which becomes very relevant when we see that—whether the author intended it or not—it is possible to re-interpret the whole poem on Shakespeare's monument ("Stay Passenger...") as in fact inviting us to solve a puzzle revealing who is [...] "in" [...] the monument [...] "with" [...] Shakespeare. The apparent answer turns out to be [...] "Christofer Marley"—as Marlowe is known to have spelt his own name—who, it says, with Shakespeare's death no longer has a [...] "page" [...] to dish up his wit.|$|E
