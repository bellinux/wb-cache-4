40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for vision-based detection and tracking of humans wearing high-visibility clothing with retro-reflective markers. Addressing industrial applications where heavy vehicles operate {{in the vicinity of}} humans, we deploy a customized stereo camera setup with active illumination that allows for efficient detection of the reflective patterns created by the worker’s safety garments. After segmenting reflective objects from the image background, the interest regions are described with local image feature descriptors and classified in order to discriminate safety garments from other reflective objects in the scene. In a final step, the trajectories of the detected humans are estimated in 3 D space relative to the camera. We evaluate our tracking system in two industrial <b>real-world</b> <b>work</b> <b>environments</b> on several challenging video sequences. The experimental results indicate accurate tracking performance and good robustness towards partial occlusions, body pose variation, and a wide range of different illumination conditions...|$|R

Such errors occur despite robust quality control procedures. Given the financial and environmental impact of these errors, {{it is important to}} understand whether labelchecking performance can be predicted by individual differences in cognitive abilities. To this end, participants carried out a simulated label-checking task together with a number of measures of information processing speed, attention, short-term/working memory, and mind-wandering. Accuracy of label checking was found to be significantly predicted by three of the measures, with better short-term verbal memory being most strongly associated with performance. Cognitive tests such as these provide a means of identifying how well employees are likely to perform when undertaking such tasks and, if necessary, how they should be supported in that role, possibly forming a screening battery when recruiting new quality control staff. The findings highlight the importance of determining the component processes of cognition which contribute to performance in <b>real-world</b> <b>work</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|R

30|$|Among the {{questions}} this {{future research should}} investigate {{is the extent to}} which the prediction model we have identified would generalize to predicting expert performance, searches for critical real-world targets (e.g., cancers in radiological scans and weapons in baggage scans), and more <b>real-world</b> <b>work</b> <b>environments</b> (Clark, Cain, Adamo, & Mitroff, 2012). Our experiment uses 10 % target prevalence as the low prevalence condition, but research has shown that the prevalence effect (i.e. increase in miss rates) becomes more pronounced as prevalence decreases further (Wolfe et al., 2005), meaning that we may be underestimating the effects of prevalence. However, our data suggest that as prevalence decreases, the strength of the predictors increases. If this trend continues to even lower prevalence rates, such as the 0.3 % prevalence found in breast cancer screening (Gur et al., 2004), then the predictors may be even stronger. Alternatively, we could find that our predictors’ strength is overestimated when predicting expert performance because training may overcome basic individual differences; although in the expertise literature there is evidence suggesting that initial abilities, such as WMC, predict performance over and above practice (Meinz & Hambrick, 2010). Additionally, real-world searches depend on the observer’s ability to find multiple different targets, whereas our observers only need to search for a target T. Future research addressing these concerns would be required to establish the value of implementing these types of screening tools in a real-world context.|$|R

40|$|The {{engineering}} internship {{is designed}} to expose the final year student {{to the real world}} of engineering. This is done over a period of workplace employment in an area of relevant focus. The internship placement was undertaken at Motherwell Automation; a firm based in Perth, Western Australia. Motherwell specialise in the design and supply of industrial control systems. The affect and direction of staff within the company was absolutely pivotal {{to the success of the}} experience. Guidance was given on many aspects and focussed around a main project which was the Teras Barge Pumping System. The Teras barge is permanently moored at Barrow Island primarily to supply a construction site with fresh water. Currently the water is pumped from the barge to standpipes on land, and this task is handled by construction personnel who operate the existing pumps and pipe work manually. The internship project was to fully automate this operation. The solution is a solar powered PLC installation, designed to sit on the barge in a suitable enclosure. This controller will operate the pumps relative to a pressure reading from the pipes supplying the standpipes. This solution was derived for our client Theiss, to assist with their construction efforts on the Gorgon project for Chevron. The full design and construction phases were completed successfully. At the time of publication, the built system is located in the Motherwell workshop awaiting Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) with the client representative. Once approved, the system will be transported to site where it will be installed and commissioned by Motherwell staff. Although the project is not fully complete, it has still allowed for suitable experience in engineering style problem solving in a <b>real-world</b> <b>work</b> <b>environment.</b> <b>The</b> theory for the whole internship has been fulfilled with the realisation of personal and work related goals...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a conceptual framework and a demonstration system that contextualize (or situate) learning in <b>the</b> context of <b>real-world</b> <b>work</b> situations. <b>The</b> conceptual framework {{is based on the}} following requirements: the choice of tasks and goals must be {{under the control of the}} user, not the system. The environment must be able to situate learning, allow situations to “talk back,” support reflection-in-action, identify the instructional information relevant for tasks at hand, and turn breakdowns from disasters into opportunities for learning. Learning must not disrupt or interfere with solving a problem, and new information to be learned must help to accomplish the task at hand. Our demonstration system JANUS (developed for the domain of architectural design) is built on an integrated architecture: a knowledge-based construction component, a hypermedia-based argumentation component, a set of critics, and a catalog of prece-dent solutions. Contextualized learning is supported by the critics that link construction and argumentation, and precedent solutions from the catalog that situate argumentation.

Nevertheless, the complete potential of the technology has not yet been fully exploited in practice due to communication limitations posed by <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> infrastructures. This <b>work</b> investigates fundamental properties of distributed optimization based on gradient methods, where gradient information is communicated using limited number of bits. In particular, a general class of quantized gradient methods are studied where the gradient direction is approximated by a finite quantization set. Sufficient and necessary conditions are provided on such a quantization set to guarantee that the methods minimize any convex objective function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a nonempty and bounded set of optimizers. A lower bound on the cardinality of the quantization set is provided, along with specific examples of minimal quantizations. Convergence rate results are established that connect the fineness of the quantization and the number of iterations needed to reach a predefined solution accuracy. Generalizations of the results to a relevant class of constrained problems using projections are considered. Finally, the results are illustrated by simulations of practical systems.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of the aging population is rapidly increasing around the world, which will cause stress on society and healthcare systems. In recent years, advances in technology have created new opportunities for automatic {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) monitoring {{to improve the quality of}} life and provide adequate medical service for the elderly. Such automatic ADL monitoring requires reliable ADL information on a fine-grained level, especially for the status of interaction between body gestures and the environment in <b>the</b> <b>real-world.</b> In this <b>work,</b> we propose a significant change spotting mechanism for periodic human motion segmentation during cleaning task performance. A novel approach is proposed based on the search for a significant change of gestures, which can manage critical technical issues in activity recognition, such as continuous data segmentation, individual variance, and category ambiguity. Three typical machine learning classification algorithms are utilized for the identification of the significant change candidate, including a Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Naive Bayesian (NB) algorithm. Overall, the proposed approach achieves 96. 41 % in the F 1 -score by using the SVM classifier.

It {{is based on}} our experiences developing a student-curated exhibit program at the College of William and Mary (W 2 ̆ 6 M) using existing spaces and designing exhibit “lab” space for the new library at Salisbury University. The presenters formerly worked together at W 2 ̆ 6 M’s Special Collections Research Center (SCRC), Bea Hardy as director and Jennie Davy as exhibits curator. Hardy is now dean of libraries at Salisbury University. W 2 ̆ 6 M’s emphasis on undergraduate research {{and a desire to}} create authentic assessments for humanities students inspired the SCRC staff in 2010 to add a program of student-curated exhibitions to its outreach agenda. We presented exhibit curation {{as an alternative to the}} typical archives instruction experience of “show and tell” and the resulting research paper. Since then, students have curated exhibits on the material culture of tobacco, W 2 ̆ 6 M student publications, nineteenth- and twentieth-century diaries, W 2 ̆ 6 M during the Jim Crow era, and other topics. Student curation allowed us opportunities to showcase and integrate our materials into coursework, come up with new exhibit ideas, fill our expansive exhibit spaces, and provide students with class projects based on <b>the</b> <b>real-world</b> <b>work</b> of public historians, archivists, and museum professionals. Student curators analyze documents or artifacts and through them tell a story to the public in their exhibits, bringing the primary sources to a wider audience. In addition to working with their regular course instructor, the students are able to draw on the expertise of the library’s exhibits curator and archivists. They often do public presentations in conjunction with their exhibits, adding to the educational value of the student curator program. One faculty member whose students have created several exhibits had this to say: This program provides a wonderful assignment for faculty to offer students. By curating an exhibit, students develop/hone their research skills, work with primary sources, interact with each other to decide on themes, choose display items, write label copy (learning the art of saying more with less), learn the labor that goes into doing good public history, and experience the thrill of having others view their work in a public forum. Students and faculty get out of the formal classroom and take advantage of resources on the campus. This program and the doors it allows me to open to students have made me a better teacher. The W 2 ̆ 6 M program used existing spaces, with some adaptations over the years to allow classes to use them more effectively. When the SCRC director moved to Salisbury University in 2012, she pushed for the creation of an exhibit lab while helping design Salisbury’s new library (opening 2016). This new lab will feature two different but quite flexible spaces and a variety of display furniture, contributing to making the library an innovative, student-centered space.

Based on actor network theory, a currently dominant perspective {{in the field of}} STS, we discuss the concept of sociomaterial <b>work</b> <b>environment.</b> An ANT perspective on <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> is relevant and timely, we argue, first and foremost because more entities are embraced in the analyses.

40|$|Prevention {{of stress}} related ill-health {{is one of}} the most {{important}} occupational health and safety issues of our time. The Swedish <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Act imposes extensive requirements regarding the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> on the employer. The employer is obliged to take all precautions necessary to prevent ill-health, also such ill-health associated with stress at work. These requirements are enforced through rules regarding co-operation between employers and employees, rules of supervision from the Swedish <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Authority and rules concerning criminal liability for <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> offences. The employer’s legal responsibility to prevent stress at work and injuries related to stress is thus, as a starting point, extensive. However, this responsibility is rarely demanded in legal practice. It has, for example, never yet occurred that an employer has been convicted of <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> offence for causing an employee stress related ill-health. This study deals with the employer's responsibility to prevent stress related ill-health and achieve a good psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> from a broad legal perspective. The study covers the fundamental purposes and legal principles that permeate the regulation of the <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> and thereby affects the employer's responsibility to prevent stress. The requirements that the <b>Work</b> <b>Environment</b> Act impose on the employer through the rules concerning the state of the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> and the general preventive obligations are examined. Furthermore, the legal possibilities to demand responsibility for the psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>environment</b> according to the rules regarding co-operation, supervision and criminal responsibility are explored.
