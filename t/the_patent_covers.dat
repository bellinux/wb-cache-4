25|$|To {{secure and}} {{increase}} market share, companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors {{from using the}} methods <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers.</b> Since 2010 the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and designs {{in the market for}} smartphones, and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, has increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2010, Facebook {{was granted}} a patent on certain aspects of its News Feed. <b>The</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers</b> News Feeds in which links are {{provided}} so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user. The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as Twitter. One {{of the most popular}} applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums and photos. Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other image hosting services such as Photobucket and Flickr, which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200photos per album.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>patents</b> <b>covered</b> a {{wide variety}} of {{instruments}}, being used to create guitars, mandolins and lute-banjos. What the two companies' instruments shared was <b>the</b> <b>patented</b> arched soundboard. Opinions by collectors have indicated that the Elias Howe instruments had a pressed soundboard, which kept its shape with internal braces. The Howe-Orme guitar also shared the adjustable neck system.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Cohen/Boyer patents" [...] {{were invented}} by Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer of University of California, San Francisco.

[...] Stanford managed <b>the</b> <b>patents</b> and licensed them nonexclusively and broadly, earning over $200 {{million for the}} universities.|$|R
50|$|Justice Hugo Black dissented, {{joined by}} Justice Douglas. They contended {{that it is}} the {{responsibility}} of the person seeking the patent to claim everything that <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers,</b> and noted that processes exist for a patent to be amended. They asserted that it was the responsibility of the Patent Office to determine the scope of the invention, and it was therefore an intrusion for courts to be expanding the scope of the patent beyond what the Patent Office has determined.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} a series of {{lawsuits}} filed by the Alzheimer’s Institute of America (AIA) starting in 2010, concerning a gene patent it controls. <b>The</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers</b> a genetic mutation that predisposes to Alzheimer's, and more importantly, it applies to transgenic mice carrying the mutation. These mice are widely used in Alzheimer's research, both by academic scientists doing basic research and by companies that use the mice to test products in development. Two of these suits are directed to companies that were started based on inventions made at universities (Comentis and Avid), and in each of those cases, the university has been sued along with the company. While none of the suits target universities that are conducting basic research using the mice, one of the suits is against Jackson Labs, a nonprofit company that provides transgenic mice to academic and commercial researchers and is an important repository of such mice.|$|E
50|$|On 15 May 2012, {{shipments}} {{of both the}} One X and the Evo 4G LTE were delayed by U.S. Customs by order of the International Trade Commission, to ensure that its software complied with an import ban imposed on HTC involving a patent owned by Apple. <b>The</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers</b> software that converts phone numbers and email addresses in text into links and presents a menu of possible actions when these links are tapped. On May 21, 2012, the Taipei Times reported that the HTC One X and HTC EVO 4G LTE shipment had cleared US Customs and was entering the United States. To comply with the ruling, the software on North American models will not follow Android's default behavior of offering a menu of apps in these circumstances, instead certain apps are assigned by default and the settings menu contains extra options for changing these associations.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{began by}} {{recognizing}} that <b>the</b> <b>patents</b> <b>cover</b> {{what amounts to}} a computerized escrow arrangement.

5000|$|A [...] "patent war" [...] between Samsung and Apple {{started when}} the latter {{claimed that the}} {{original}} Galaxy S Android phone copied the interfaceand possibly the hardwareof Apple's iOS for the iPhone 3GS. There was also smartphone patents licensing and litigation involving Sony Mobile, Google, Apple Inc., Samsung, Microsoft, Nokia, Motorola, HTC, Huawei and ZTE, among others. The conflict {{is part of the}} wider [...] "patent wars" [...] between multinational technology and software corporations. To secure and increase market share, companies granted a patent can sue to prevent competitors from using the methods <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers.</b> Since 2010 the number of lawsuits, counter-suits, and trade complaints based on patents and designs in the market for smartphones, and devices based on smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, has increased significantly. Initial suits, countersuits, rulings, license agreements, and other major events began in 2009 as the smartphone market grew more rapidly.|$|E
5000|$|On March 21, 2008, EA, MTV, and Harmonix were sued by the Gibson Guitar Corporation for {{violation}} of the 1999 , which Gibson claims covers technology that simulates a concert performance via pre-recorded audio and a musical instrument; this follows similar action that Gibson has taken against the Guitar Hero series, which was later settled out of court. The Gibson-Harmonix case was put on hold shortly after its filing to allow the United States Patent and Trademark Office to open a re-examination of the 405 patent. On subsequent review, the 405 patent was modified to more exactly define the type of musical instrument that <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers,</b> as the original language had conflicted with [...] Due to the change in language, Harmonix sought to have the case go forward and requested a summary judgement, believing that the new language of the 405 patent {{did not include the}} Rock Band controllers. In mid 2010, the case was settled between all parties under non-disclosed terms.|$|E
5000|$|Recognizing that EVV was a {{critical}} part of the entire documentation process, <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers</b> the entire scope of the work. EVV has been sectioned out because of its enormous impact on bringing accountability to the industry. Indeed EVV is a method used to verify visit activity for Home Health (Skilled Service), Home Care (Personal Care Service) and Hospice (End-of-life Service) [...] This accountability measure will help to ensure that patients are not neglected. EVV can and should cut down on fraudulently documented home visits, and is the means of electronically verifying that a caregiver is physically present with the patient. EVV monitors locations of caregivers and is mandated by certain states, including Texas and Illinois. Other states do not mandate it, but use it as part of its Medicaid fraud oversight created by the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. It is also widely used by employers of home healthcare providers to verify employee's locations and hours of work as well as document patient care. Today, most states and other payers rely on EVV as a more effective monitoring tool than a hand-signed document.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Foster <b>patented</b> <b>the</b> {{rules of}} Arena football, meaning that only persons {{authorized}} by him could use his rules {{and his name}} for the sport. While the AFL asserted throughout the 1990s that <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covered</b> virtually {{every aspect of the}} game (from the 50-yard field to the eight-man format), a 1998 lawsuit (Arena Football League v. Professional Indoor Football League) established that <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> specifically <b>covered</b> <b>the</b> rebound net feature, meaning that competitors and imitators who attempted to copy the game couldn't use this aspect of the rules. However, under provisions of U.S. patent law, Foster's patent expired on March 27, 2007, enabling imitators to use his rebound nets (at least as originally envisioned, without other innovations that he may have patented).|$|R

40|$|A patent confers on the {{patentee}} {{the right}} to exclude others {{from the use of}} the knowledge that <b>the</b> <b>patent</b> <b>covers.</b> Patents, however, are not the only feasible way to reach exclusiveness and other economic means might be used as well. Indeed, the alternatives are often thought to be more effective at enabling the inventor to benefit from the innovation than patenting itself (Levin et al., 1987; Cohen et al., 1996). The instrument of exclusion is, however, not a matter of indifference for society. The way in which patents are used (or not used) affects the evolution of the industrial structure and the technology itself. Specifically, unlike such alternatives as lead time, first mover advantage and secrecy, patents can be used to sell technology, typically through license contracts. Simply put, patents can {{play a key role in}} facilitating the purchase and sale of technology. This essay moves beyond the traditional approach to patents that has mainly focused on patents as means to exclude others and highlights the role of the market for technology. A market for technology not only helps diffuse existing technology more efficiently, it also enables firms to specialize in the generation of new technology. In turn, such specialization is likely to hasten the pace of technological change itself. However, the development of a market for technology is not an automatic outcome, and depends upon a number of factors that include the strength of patent rights, as well as the nature of the technology and the industry structure itself...|$|E
