5|$|George Reid {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the Westminster tradition and regarded a <b>two-party</b> <b>system</b> as very much the norm.|$|E
5|$|By Election Day, November 2, 1920, few had {{any doubts}} that the Republican ticket would win. Harding {{received}} 60.2percent {{of the popular}} vote, the highest percentage since {{the evolution of the}} <b>two-party</b> <b>system,</b> and 404 electoral votes. Cox received 34percent of the national vote and 127 electoral votes. Campaigning from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence for opposing the war, Socialist Eugene V. Debs received 3percent of the national vote. The Republicans greatly increased their majority in each house of Congress.|$|E
5|$|The United States has {{operated}} under a <b>two-party</b> <b>system</b> {{for most of}} its history. For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The President and Vice-president are elected through the Electoral College system.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{single-member}} districts tend to promote <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> (with some regional parties). Called Duverger's law, this principle has also been empirically supported by the cube rule which shows how the winning party in a first-past-the-post system is mathematically over-represented in the final chamber of representatives. Supporters view this as beneficial, as parliamentary governments are typically more stable in <b>two-party</b> <b>systems,</b> and minorities do not have undue power to break a coalition. First-past-the-post minimizes the influence of third parties and thus arguably keeps out extremists. Critics of <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> believe that <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> offer less choice to voters, create an exaggerated emphasis on issues that dominate more marginal seats, and does not completely remove the possibility of a balanced chamber (or hung parliament), which can also give undue power to independents and lead to even greater instability.|$|R
50|$|<b>Two-party</b> <b>systems</b> {{are similar}} to multiparty systems in that power is not {{concentrated}} in one party and that parties {{have to consider the}} opinion of the general public in order to retain power by winning elections. However, <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> restrict the people's democratic rights by not authorising the citizen's to found their own political parties.|$|R

5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the <b>two-party</b> <b>system.</b> Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a <b>two-party</b> <b>system</b> (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Khrushchev divided oblast (province) level Party {{committees}} {{into two}} parallel structures, one for industry {{and one for}} agriculture. This was unpopular among Party apparatchiks, and led to confusions {{in the chain of}} command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each oblast, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a <b>two-party</b> <b>system.</b> Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop and}} test {{a model of}} {{accurate}} representation of median voters in <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> with divergent party Left-Right positions. The model requires two key conditions: (1) electorates are deterministic policy choosers, and (2) the pace of policy change is slow. We test the model by investigating whether a centrist policy position enhances a party’s electability. The model largely fails this test, as there is only modest evidence of a connection between centrism and winning. We conclude with a discussion the implications for the possibilities for accurate representation in <b>two-party</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
5|$|Soon after {{purchasing}} the Star, Harding {{turned his attention}} to politics, supporting Foraker in his first successful bid for governor in 1885. Foraker was part of the war generation that challenged older Ohio Republicans, such as Senator John Sherman, for control of state politics. Harding, always a party loyalist, supported Foraker in the complex internecine warfare that was Ohio Republican politics. Harding was willing to tolerate Democrats, as necessary to a <b>two-party</b> <b>system,</b> but had only contempt for those who bolted the Republican Party to join third-party movements. He was a delegate to the Republican state convention in 1888, at the age of 22, representing Marion County, and would be elected a delegate in most years until becoming president.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading cabinet {{member in the}} new {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party. A major issue {{in the emergence of}} the American <b>two-party</b> <b>system</b> was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly trade relations with Britain, to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton {{played a central role in}} the Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether electoral {{motives and}} government ideology influence short-term economic performance. I employ data on annual GDP growth in 21 OECD countries over the 1951 - 2006 period {{and provide a}} battery of empirical tests. In countries with <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> GDP growth is boosted before elections and, under leftwing governments, {{in the first two}} years of a legislative period. These findings indicate that political cycles are more prevalent in <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> because voters can clearly punish or reward political parties for governmental performance. My findings imply that we need more elaborate theories of how government ideology and electoral motives influence short-term economic performance. ...|$|R
40|$|A general {{separability}} condition on {{the second}} moment (covariance matrix) for continuous variable <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> is derived by an analysis analogous to the derivation of the Kennard's uncertainty relation without referring to the non-negativity of the partially transposed density matrix. This separability criterion is generally more stringent than that used by Simon {{which is based on}} the non-negativity of partially transposed density matrix, and thus this criterion may be useful in the analysis of general continuous <b>two-party</b> <b>systems.</b> Another separability criterion used by Duan et al. is shown to be generally weaker than that of Simon. We thus have a hierarchy of separability criteria, but all these criteria when combined with suitable squeezing become equivalent at the boundary of the P-representation condition and thus turned out to be sufficient to analyze the separability of <b>two-party</b> Gaussian <b>systems.</b> Comment: 8 pages.

40|$|In {{the quest}} to {{completely}} describe entanglement in the general case of {{a finite number of}} parties sharing a physical system of finite-dimensional Hilbert space an entanglement magnitude is introduced for its pure and mixed states: robustness. It corresponds to the minimal amount of mixing with locally prepared states which washes out all entanglement. It quantifies in a sense the endurance of entanglement against noise and jamming. Its properties are studied comprehensively. Analytical expressions for the robustness are given for pure states of <b>two-party</b> <b>systems,</b> and analytical bounds for mixed states of <b>two-party</b> <b>systems.</b> Specific results are obtained mainly for the qubit-qubit system (qubit denotes quantum bit). As by-products local pseudomixtures are generalized, a lower bound for the relative volume of separable states is deduced, and arguments for considering convexity a necessary condition of any entanglement measure are put forward...|$|R
50|$|Riker {{pointed to}} Canada's {{regional}} politics, {{as well as}} the U.S. presidential election of 1860, as examples of often temporary regional instability that occurs from time-to-time in otherwise stable <b>two-party</b> <b>systems</b> (Riker, 1982). In the case of Canada, the highly regionalised parties are evident in province-by-province examination: while the multiparty system {{can be seen in the}} Canadian House of Commons, many of the provinces' elections are dominated by <b>two-party</b> <b>systems.</b> Quebec, for instance, is driven mainly by the sovereigntist, center-left Parti Québécois and the center-right Liberal Party, while in Saskatchewan, it is the left-wing New Democratic Party and the centre-right Saskatchewan Party (a coalition of those affiliated with the Conservative and Liberal Parties). Unlike in the United States, where the two major parties are organized and unified at the federal, state and local level, Canada's federal and provincial parties generally operate as separate organizations.|$|R
