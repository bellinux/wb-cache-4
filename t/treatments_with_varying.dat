The alloy must be in single crystalline form to demonstrate these properties. Growth of single crystals from the molten phase is a time consuming and expensive process. We conduct grain growth experiments to produce single crystals from the solid state. This production route is comparatively inexpensive and avoids disadvantages such as chemical segregation. To process these single crystals, alloys with various compositions were cast, from bulk materials, into cylindrical copper ingot molds with diameters ranging from 0. 9 mm to 1. 9 mm.

The results showed that pressure-induced germination was maximal (62 %) after a treatment at 200  MPa and 20  °C and increased with pressure-holding time and post-pressurization incubation time. Treatment temperature had no significant effect on germination. A central composite experimental design with three factors (pressure, pressure-holding time, and post-pressurization incubation time) using response surface methodology was used to optimize the germination rate in distilled water and in skim milk. No factor interaction was observed. Germination was induced at lower pressure and was faster in milk than in distilled water, but complete germination was not reached.

This was because of the inefficiency of LEDs at high light levels. This poster will discuss the effects decreasing blue light on lettuce and kale, and the interactions between high light (PPF; 500 µmol m 2 s- 1, 11. 5 Mol m 2 d- 1) and low light (200 µmol m 2 d- 1, 28. 5 Mol m 2 d- 1).

Methane emission was recorded by an automatic closed chamber system facilitating continuous measurements over the entire dry and wet season of 1994. The methane emission rates in the dry season were generally {{higher than in the}} wet season; the seasonal patterns of methane emission in the individual treatments showed a high degree of similarity in both seasons. Mid-tillering drainage prompted a pronounced decrease in methane emission rates which was attributed to the influx of oxygen into the soil. Low methane fluxes prevailed even after the field was reflooded. In the other treatments, which were kept flooded during tillering stage, methane emission rates stayed relatively constant. Drainage at 14 days before harvest prompted a short-term increase of methane emission rate which was attributed to a degassing of soi l entrapped methane. In the field that was flooded throughout the growing season, the process of harvesting was also associated with the short-term release of large amounts of methane. The results of this experiment demonstrate that 1) rainfed rice has a lower emission potential than irrigated rice, 2) the impact of droughts on methane emission depends on the actual growing stage the drought occurs, 3) methane emission from rainfed rice will increase with advances gained in water supply, and 4) temporary drainage can be an effective measure to reduce methane emission from rice...|$|E

Proliferation of mononuclear cells from patients with SLE was not suppressed by <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> mycobacteria.

Methods: An economic evaluation from a societal perspective accompanying a randomized controlled trial with a 24 -month follow-up. 80 participants (8 - 19 years) with severe obesity were included. Participants received an intensive 1 -year lifestyle treatment with an inpatient period of 2 months (short-stay group) or 6 months (long-stay group). Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12,and 24 months and included SDS-BMI and QALYs. Results: SDS-BMI decreased in the first 6 months of treatment, stabilized in the second 6 months, and increased during the 2 nd year in both groups. After 24 months, SDS-BMI was similar in both groups, but remained lower than baseline values (mean difference - 0. 24, 95 % CI - 0. 42; - 0. 06). There {{was no difference in}} QALYs between the groups after 24 months. For SDS-BMI, the probability of the short-stay treatment being cost-effective in comparison with the long-stay treatment was 1 at a willingness-to-pay of 0 EUR/unit of effect, which slowly decreased to 0. 54 for larger willingness-to-pay values. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, the short-stay treatment is considered to be more cost-effective from the societal perspective in comparison with the long-stay treatment.

Simulated rainfall was applied to 0. 75 m wide by 2 m long plots located within feedlot pens. Sieve and pipette analyses were used to measure the diameters of the eroded materials. No significant differences in runoff and erosion were found among the <b>treatments</b> <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> amounts of USM. Values for D 50, the size for which 50 % of the sediment is smaller, were 36 μm or less for each of the treatments containing varying amounts of USM.

Methods: Hexane extract of the leaves of Juglans regia was prepared by hot extraction.

Flow cytometry, using propidium iodide as a staining agent, was used to study the effect of the extract on cell cycle phase distribution.

Results: The extract of Juglans regia exhibited a potent and dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity against human prostate cancer cells in vitro. The extract also induced significant apoptosis in these PC 3 cancer cells as revealed by annexin V binding assay as well as inverted phase contrast microscopy. It triggered a significant formation of apoptotic bodies after <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> concentrations of the extract. Within 48 h of incubation, approximately 9. 5, 15. 5 and 26. 3 % of the cells underwent early apoptosis after <b>treatment</b> <b>with</b> 5, 50 and 100 µg/mL of the extract, respectively. Similarly, 5. 2, 11. 2 an...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} depletion of bone marrow under cancer chemotherapy is analyzed as an optimal control problem. The control represents the drug dosage of a single chemotherapeutic agent and pharmacokinetic equations which model its plasma concentration are included. The drug dosages enter the objective linearly. It is shown that optimal controls are bang-bang, i. e. alternate the drug dosages at full dose with rest-periods in between, and that singular controls which correspond to <b>treatment</b> schedules <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dosages at less than maximum rate are not optimal. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate {{the effect of the}} pharmacokinetic equations on the dosages. ...|$|R
