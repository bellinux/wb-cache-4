25|$|Polyacrylamide gel (PAG) {{had been}} known as a {{potential}} embedding medium for sectioning tissues as early as 1964, and two independent groups employed PAG in electrophoresis in 1959. It possesses several electrophoretically desirable features that make it a versatile medium. It is a synthetic, <b>thermo-stable,</b> transparent, strong, chemically relatively inert gel, and can be prepared {{with a wide range}} of average pore sizes. The pore size of a gel and the reproducibility in gel pore size are determined by three factors, the total amount of acrylamide present (%T) (T = Total concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomer), the amount of cross-linker (%C) (C = bisacrylamide concentration), and the time of polymerization of acrylamide (cf. QPNC-PAGE). Pore size decreases with increasing %T; with cross-linking, 5%C gives the smallest pore size. Any increase or decrease in %C from 5% increases the pore size, as pore size with respect to %C is a parabolic function with vertex as 5%C. This appears to be because of non-homogeneous bundling of polymer strands within the gel. This gel material can also withstand high voltage gradients, is amenable to various staining and destaining procedures, and can be digested to extract separated fractions or dried for autoradiography and permanent recording.|$|E

5000|$|Among the {{functional}} proteins detected in donkey milk, there are molecules active in antimicrobial protection such as lysozyme and lactoferrin. The lactoferrin content of donkey milk is intermediate between the lower values of cow milk {{and the higher}} values of human milk. Lactoferrin inhibits the growth of iron-dependent bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. This inhibits certain organisms, such as coliforms and yeast, that require iron. Lysozyme in donkey milk is present in large amounts, indeed ranges from 1.0 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL, depending on the analytical method used (chemical or microbiological); [...] this substance is present also in human (0.12 mg/ml) but only in trace amounts in cow and goat milk.

50|$|In {{order to}} amplify {{small amounts of}} DNA, the same {{methodology}} is used as in conventional PCR using a DNA template, at least one pair of specific primers, deoxyribonucleotides, a suitable buffer solution and a <b>thermo-stable</b> DNA polymerase. A substance marked with a fluorophore is added to this mixture in a thermal cycler that contains sensors for measuring the fluorescence of the fluorophore {{after it has been}} excited at the required wavelength allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products. This allows the rate of generation of the amplified product to be measured at each PCR cycle. The data thus generated can be analysed by computer software to calculate relative gene expression (or mRNA copy number) in several samples. Quantitative PCR can also be applied to the detection and quantification of DNA in samples to determine the presence and abundance of a particular DNA sequence in these samples. This measurement is made after each amplification cycle, and this is the reason why this method is called real time PCR (that is, immediate or simultaneous PCR). In the case of RNA quantitation, the template is complementary DNA (cDNA), which is obtained by reverse transcription of ribonucleic acid (RNA). In this instance the technique used is quantitative RT-PCR or Q-RT-PCR.|$|E

50|$|PCR {{amplification}} of the DNA target {{occurs in}} three steps: denaturation, annealing and extension. Each of theses steps occur {{at a specific}} temperature for a fixed period of time. Denaturation is normally allowed to occur between 90 and 95 °C and leads to the dissociation of DNA strands. After this the reaction is cooled to between 40 and 70 °C to allow the primers to associate with their respective target sequences. This step {{is known as the}} annealing step and is primer specific. The temperature at which the primers anneal is critical. Too high temperatures would not allow the primers to associate with the DNA, resulting in no or poor amplification. Too low annealing temperature would ultimately lead to non-specific binding of the primers and non-specific amplification. Primers bound to the regions flanking the target DNA provide 3’-hydroxyl groups for DNA polymerase catalyzed extension. The most commonly used DNA polymerase is Taq, a <b>thermo-stable</b> enzyme isolated from the thermophilic bacterium, Thermus aquaticus. The DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands along the template strands, using the primers as starting points. During the extension step the strands are amplified beyond the target DNA. This means that each newly synthesized strand of DNA will have a region complimentary to a primer. There is an exponential increase in the amount of DNA produced as the three above mentioned steps are repeated in a cyclic fashion. In a traditional PCR these steps might be repeated 20 to 55 times. A problem, however, with PCR amplification is that the temperature required for DNA strand dissociation also results in DNA polymerase denaturation. This is partially overcome by the bioengineering of polymerases which are more thermal stable and have longer half-lives.|$|E

In general terms, the two main outcomes of this research are: (1) advancing the knowledge on the structuring processes for fluid gel design and (2) developing new models for the structure-function relationship for fluid gels. There is currently a lack of understanding on the formation of <b>thermo-stable</b> fluid gels due to the absence of processing techniques for their production. In this thesis, two processing techniques were developed to produce <b>thermo-stable</b> fluid gels from alginates. The first technique is a continuous process comprising a pin stirrer device with a Ca 2 +-injection system. The second production technique used a cup and vane rheometer combined with an internal gelation method. With this technique, the kinetics of fluid gel formation was studied as function of applied shear rate, calcium concentration and alginate molecular weight. With regard to the structure-function relationship, the lubricating behaviour of agar fluid gels was explored using a new approach which consisted in decoupling the contributions of the continuous phase and the particulate gelled phase.

The formation and physical properties of fluid gels are discussed with the focus being on the process–structure relationship. Recent {{work in this area}} has {{led to the development of}} new techniques for the production of <b>thermo-stable</b> fluid gels. An overview is provided on these techniques which have been successfully employed to produce <b>thermo-stable</b> fluid gels from both alginate and proteins. An enhanced understanding of the molecular events occurring during fluid gel formation is outlined which has enabled greater control over the microstructure. This has allowed the production of small (< 10  μm), spherical and reasonably soft particles which resemble oil droplets. These particles when used in emulsion based products to replace a significant proportion of the oil, show rheology matching that of the full fat original product. Increasing the volume fraction and elasticity of fluid gel particles has been shown to decrease the friction measured at the contact between the soft surfaces of a tribometer. This ability of fluid gel particles to provide lubrication through entrainment to the contact zone suggests that fluid gels have the potential to impart sensory attributes typically associated with fat. Directions for future research are also discussed which may provide further insights into food structuring and breakdown thereby assisting the design of more complex structures with novel functional attributes...|$|E

40|$|<b>Thermo-stable,</b> operationally defined soil protein, {{known as}} glomalin, may make an {{important}} contribution to carbon storage in soils. The term glomalin is used because this putative protein, or group of proteins, was originally thought to be produced only by Glomus fungi. There is currently little information on the glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) content of tropical soils, particularly allophanic soils that are known to have different carbon dynamics to temperate climate soils. We have measured the Bradford-reactive GRSP content of soils sampled from forests and grasslands on the tropical island of Martinique and compared the observations with soil composition. Two operationally defined fractions of GRSP were measured, namely easily-extractable and total GRSP. The contents of GRSP in moist soils were in the range of 2 – 36 [*]g[*]kg− 1, accounting for about 8 % of soil organic carbon, and were greater in topsoils than in corresponding subsoils. Both the GRSP contents and the fraction of soil organic carbon attributed to GRSP were greater than those reported for temperate climate soils. Both total and easily extractable GRSP contents were positively correlated to soil organic carbon content. The fraction of soil organic carbon that could be attributed to soil protein decreased with increasing allophane content for allophanic soils. No other trends of GRSP content with soil properties or land use were found. GRSP extraction was decreased about seven-fold by air-drying of soils, confirming the irreversible change in the soil microstructure of allophanic soils. Total and easily extractable GRSP were correlated and we conclude that both are good probes of <b>thermo-stable</b> soil protein content for these soils.

The present research provides evidence that amylose–lipid complexes {{play an important role}} in starch biphasic pasting.

40|$|Samples of 3 % glucomannan gels {{made with}} 0. 6 M KOH and {{preheated}} at T ht: 25 °C (A), 50 °C (B), 70 °C (C) and 90 °C (D) were studied at two measurement temperatures (T m: 50 and 70 °C) and compared to T m: 25 °C. Samples B and C were gels more <b>thermo-stable</b> at high measurement temperatures. This {{means that a}} preliminary heating at 50 and 70 °C {{would be needed to}} retain their structural integrity of these gels. When the preheated gels were subjected to high deformation (puncture test), rigidity increased with increasing T m. Similarly, small deformation tests showed that at T m: 50 °C and 70 °C, the C sample had better gel characteristics than the others: i. e. higher elasticity and lower frequency-dependence of viscoelastic moduli. This means that there was more particle aggregation, so that when gels C were heated they would maintain a high degree of internal cohesion and connectivity. Mechanical and rheological analyses were consistent with the structures shown in SEM photographs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{thermophilic}} bacteria as live-cell catalysts in biofuel and biochemical {{industry has}} surged in recent years, {{due to their}} tolerance of high temperature and wide spectrum of carbon-sources that include cellulose. However their direct employment as microbial cellular factories in the highly demanding industrial conditions has been hindered by uncompetitive biofuel productivity, relatively low tolerance to solvent and osmic stresses, and limitation in genome engineering tools. In this work we review recent advances in dissecting and engineering the metabolic and regulatory networks of thermophilic bacteria for improving the traits of key interest in biofuel industry: cellulose degradation, pentose-hexose co-utilization, and tolerance of thermal, osmotic, and solvent stresses. Moreover, new technologies enabling more efficient genetic engineering of thermophiles were discussed, such as improved electroporation, ultrasound-mediated DNA delivery, as well as <b>thermo-stable</b> plasmids and functional selection systems. Expanded applications of such technological advancements in thermophilic microbes promise to substantiate a synthetic biology perspective, where functional parts, module, chassis, cells and consortia were modularly designed and rationally assembled for the many missions at industry and nature that demand the extraordinary talents of these extremophiles.
