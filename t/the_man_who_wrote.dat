25|$|One afternoon, while Marjory and Archibald are at Castle Crom {{looking at}} the Spanish documents, the {{landlord}} of the castle arrives and interrupts them. This landlord is a Spaniard named Don Bernardino—the descendant of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the documents. He is astounded that Archibald has possession of the documents and asks that Archibald return the documents to their proper place and not disturb them again. Archibald and Marjory nonetheless decide to continue looking for the treasure, which they find (with some danger) in the cave under Archibald's house. Don Bernardino and Archibald almost have a duel over this newfound treasure, but decide against it. Meanwhile, Marjory goes missing.|$|E
500|$|Promoting saints was {{something}} Jocelin would repeat at Glasgow, where he [...] "transferred his enthusiasm to St Kentigern" [...] and commissioned a hagiography of that saint, the saint most venerated by the Celts {{of the diocese}} of Glasgow. It {{is no coincidence that}} Jocelin of Furness, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the Life of St. Waltheof, was the same man later commissioned to write the Life of St. Kentigern.|$|E

500|$|On August 5, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Here's Johnny", {{a parody}} of [...] "Who's Johnny" [...] by El DeBarge. The song, a loving ode to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson announcer Ed McMahon, features John Roarke of the television series Fridays fame doing an impression of McMahon's voice. According to Yankovic, Peter Wolf, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] "Who's Johnny", enjoyed the parody idea {{so much that he}} personally brought the floppy disc program that had all the synthesizer parts for the original song into the studio when Yankovic was recording his parody. The final parody recorded for the album was [...] "Toothless People", a play on Mick Jagger's [...] "Ruthless People", which was recorded on August 29, 1986. The song, about elderly people who are missing their teeth, was written after Yankovic heard it would be the theme to the 1986 film Ruthless People. Assuming the song would be a hit, Yankovic requested and received permission from Jagger to record a parody version. [...] When Jagger's song failed to crack the Top 40, Yankovic considered not recording his version, but because Jagger had [...] "authorized" [...] the parody, he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to the artist. Therefore, he recorded the spoof anyway.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> Peccavi should stoop to this".|$|E
2500|$|Gould, therefore, prefers an ahistorical, or {{at least}} pre-Renaissance, view of art, {{minimizing}} {{the identity of the}} artist and the attendant historical context in evaluating the artwork: [...] "What gives us the right to assume that in the work of art we must receive a direct communication with the historical attitudes of another period? ... moreover, what makes us assume that the situation of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> it accurately or faithfully reflects the situation of his time? ... What if the composer, as historian, is faulty?" ...|$|E
60|$|What may we suppose is {{the reason}} of this great stillness and soberness of the gospels? I believe {{that it may be}} {{explained}} thus. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> them were too much awed by our Lord, to make more words about him than they absolutely needed.|$|R

2500|$|Armstrong often {{stated that}} he was born on July 4, 1900, [...] "For many years {{it was thought that}} Armstrong was born in New Orleans on July 4, 1900, a perfect day for <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the musical Declaration of Independence for Americans of this century. But the estimable writer Gary Giddins {{discovered}} the birth certificate that proves Armstrong was born Aug. 4, 1901," [...] a date that has been noted in many biographies. Although he died in 1971, {{it was not until the}} mid-1980s that his true birth date, August 4, 1901, was discovered by the researcher Tad Jones through the examination of baptismal records. At least one other biography treats the July 4th birth date as a myth.|$|E
2500|$|The first season, {{consisting}} of 12 episodes, follows Michael Westen's {{investigation into the}} identity of the man who burned him. [...] It also introduced the main characters: Fiona Glenanne, Michael's ex-girlfriend; Sam Axe, a former Navy SEAL and Michael's best friend; and Madeline [...] "Maddie" [...] Westen, Michael's hypochondriac mother. [...] The season saw many appearances by Agents Harris and Lane (Marc Macaulay and Brandon Morris), two FBI agents sent to keep tabs on Michael, but were eventually replaced by Jason Bly (Alex Carter), all are in turn removed from Michael's case. [...] By the end of the season, Michael has discovered the identity of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> his burn notice, Phillip Cowan (Richard Schiff), only to see him killed. [...] Michael later is contacted by a mysterious woman, ending the season on a cliffhanger.|$|E
2500|$|In 1872 she {{permanently}} {{retired from}} the stage with four performances of [...] "Fidalma" [...] in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto, at the Paris Théâtre des Italiens but, in fact, she never gave up singing in private and in benefit concerts. When in 1887 the French and Italian Governments agreed upon moving the mortal remains of Rossini into the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Alboni, then a sixty-one-year-old lady living in seclusion, wrote to the Italian Foreign Minister, Di Robilant, proposing that the Petite Messe Solennelle, [...] "the last musical composition by Rossini", be performed in Santa Croce {{the day of the}} funeral, and [...] "demanding the honour, as an Italian and a pupil of the immortal Maestro," [...] of singing it herself in her [...] "dear and beloved homeland". Her wish, however, never came true and she was just given the chance of being present at the exhumation ceremony in Paris. The Paris correspondent of the Rome newspaper Il Fanfulla wrote on the occasion: [...] "photographers snapped in the same shot the greatest performer of Cenerentola and Semiramide, and what is left of <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> these masterpieces".|$|E
5000|$|Walter Ryerson Johnson (October 19, 1901 - May 24, 1995) was an American {{pulp fiction}} writer and editor.

2500|$|Griffith—indignant at the film's {{negative}} critical reception—wrote {{letters to}} newspapers and published a pamphlet {{in which he}} accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions. [...] Griffith's 1916 pamphlet The Rise and Fall of a Free Speech in America used racialized language and images, such as a cartoon that depicted [...] "censorship" [...] as a monstrous black man with a lascivious {{expression on his face}} eyeing [...] "free speech" [...] who appeared as a white woman dressed in a white dress. [...] "Free Speech" [...] points at [...] "Censorship" [...] and says: [...] "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!". In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship [...] "this malignant pygmy" [...] who had mutated into a fully grown [...] "Caliban" [...] (a character from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest who is often depicted as a black man). When Sherwin Lewis of The New York Globe wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few [...] "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that [...] "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the editorial was [...] "damaging my reputation as a producer" [...] and [...] "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, Intolerance (1916), as a response to those who had criticized his film.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E
2500|$|His {{increasing}} {{reputation as}} both performer and improviser {{continued to make}} Franck much in demand for inaugural or dedicatory recitals of new or rebuilt Cavaillé-Coll organs: Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély's new instrument at Saint-Sulpice (1862) and later for organs at Notre-Dame, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, and La Trinité; {{for some of these}} instruments, Franck had acted (by himself or with Camille Saint-Saëns) as consultant. [...] At his own church, people began to come to hear the improvisations for the Mass and the Office. [...] In addition, Franck began to give [...] "organ-concerts" [...] or recitals at Sainte-Clotilde of his own works and those of other composers. [...] Perhaps his most notable concert arose from the attendance at a Sunday Mass in April 1866 of Franz Liszt, who sat in the choir to listen to Franck's improvisations and afterward said [...] "How could I ever forget <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> those trios?" [...] To which Franck is supposed to have murmured a little sadly, [...] "I fancy I have done rather better things since then.". [...] Liszt organized a concert at Sainte-Clotilde to promote Franck's organ works later that month, which was well received by its listeners and well reported in the musical journals. [...] Despite his comment about the trios, Franck was pleased to hear that not only Liszt but Hans von Bülow was including them in concerts in Germany on a regular basis. [...] Franck reinforced his understanding of German organ music and how it should be played by hearing Anton Bruckner at Notre-Dame in 1869. [...] He began to have a regular circle of pupils, who were there ostensibly for organ study but showed increasing interest in Franck's compositional techniques.|$|E

5000|$|J.

The poem [...] "Going and Coming Back," [...] which closes the poetry section, “in its own tightly written and beautifully expressed way gives us the poet and his choices in life.

60|$|You {{might think}} that these qualities would displease the reviewer's editor.
