5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued {{for at least}} an hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves {{in the midst of an}} intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast, Northern Ireland, where a person's religion and income are evident by the street they live on. He contrasted this with the anonymity he felt when visiting Ethiopia, saying: [...] "...the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren't such divisions, {{a place where the}} streets have no name. To me, that's the way a great rock 'n' roll concert should be: a place where everyone comes together... Maybe that's the dream of all art: to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all." [...] Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife, Ali Hewson; he first wrote <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> an airsickness bag while staying in a village.|$|E

Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down.

500|$|Though {{the song}} {{has never been}} {{performed}} live {{as part of a}} televised performance, the song was featured on the set list of the Loud Tour.

500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{artist was}} Tetsuya Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated {{rather than simply}} typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a separate sheet of paper". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as [...] "kakkoii", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair in addition to saving polygons. Nomura feared, however, that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past.|$|E

500|$|The River Touques has two {{branches}} {{running through}} the town, and the 13th Parachute Battalion were given the objective of establishing a bridgehead across the river. The battalion reached and safely crossed the westernmost branch, but heavy German resistance prevented them from securing {{the main part of}} the town. Overnight a patrol managed to cross the eastern branch, using a girder that had been left spanning the river when the bridge had been blown up. The patrol was then reinforced by 'A' and 'B' Companies, and fought a three-hour battle trying to form a bridgehead. They were then withdrawn back across the river, where the 7th Parachute Battalion had dug in to form a defensive position. At the same time, the 12th Parachute Battalion had tried to cross the river using fords to secure Saint Julien and the nearby railway embankment. They, too, were stopped by heavy German fire, which pinned <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the embankment, inflicting significant casualties; 16dead and 50wounded. As they were unable to proceed, brigade headquarters called off their attack, but the battalion had to wait until dark to pull back. [...] The next day, 24August, a patrol from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night. The whole brigade crossed the river and advanced unopposed to Bourg, which was secured after a brief fight. The brigade was halted again and the commandos of 1st Special Service Brigade took over the lead. On 26August, to provide some mobility, the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade was placed under the brigade's command. Together with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, they headed for Pont Audmer, which was the brigade's final objective. The Dutch were ordered to move with all speed, but arrived 20minutes after the retreating Germans had blown up the bridge across the River Seine, and just before the 7th Parachute Battalion arrived by foot.|$|E

2500|$|Regular duckpin bowling {{is popular}} in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. [...] One popular {{pinspotter}} in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was produced from 1953-1973.

[...] The Sherman's sweep device is located on the right side, vertical [...] "kickback" [...] panel of the lane and pivots 180 degrees (much like a fence gate) to clear pins. [...] The pin table always handles the pins by the neck. [...] A new rack of pins is created with a moving magazine that is shaped like a pin triangle.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} Final Fantasy VIIs world {{was for a}} fully modern setting, but after the project moved from the 2D Super Nintendo Entertainment System to development for the PlayStation console, the setting altered with it. Elements from the original concept were later used in Final Fantasy VIII and Parasite Eve. The game's producer, Hironobu Sakaguchi, chose character designer Tetsuya Nomura to create the main cast. Nomura had previously worked on monster designs for Final Fantasy VI. Sakaguchi chose Nomura after being amused by the way Nomura did the storyboarding for the cutscenes. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters.

When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a separate sheet of paper." [...] Nomura also created Zack Fair, who was a late addition to the cast meant to add depth to Cloud and Aerith's relationship, and came up with the name for Red XIII, wanting an [...] "interesting" [...] name that combined a color and a number. Although the game was Nomura's favorite Final Fantasy project, he felt that it was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his [...] "true" [...] style.|$|E
