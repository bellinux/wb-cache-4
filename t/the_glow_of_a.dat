25|$|<b>The</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flame is complex. Black-body {{radiation}} is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles {{are too small}} to behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the {{radiation is}} emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. The photo of the forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|$|E

60|$|A merry voice bade them enter. The coach {{opened the}} door and led Ken across the threshold. Ken felt <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warm, bright room, {{colorful}} with pennants and posters, and cozy in its disorder. Then he saw Dale and, behind him, several other students. There was a moment's silence in which Ken heard his heart beat.|$|E
50|$|In March, she {{underwent}} drydocking at Pearl Harbor; {{then took}} on cargo and passengers. She returned to Ulithi on 4 April 1945, and, on 12 April, departed that port steaming in convoy for Okinawa. She anchored off the Hagushi landing beaches on 18 April. Near dusk each evening, the general alarm sounded, <b>a</b> regular reminder <b>of</b> {{the danger of}} Japanese air raiders. On 2 May, sailors on board Tuscana saw the flash of firing off the ship's starboard quarter and later observed <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion which they thought marked the fiery end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Japanese suicide boat. On 6 May, Tuscana began to assemble nets and moorings to screen the anchorage.|$|R
50|$|Upsilon Aquilae is a {{subgiant star}} with <b>a</b> stellar {{classification}} <b>of</b> A3 IV. The outer atmosphere is radiating energy into space at <b>an</b> effective temperature <b>of</b> 7,906 K, which gives it <b>the</b> white-hot <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> A-type star. It is spinning relatively quickly with a projected rotational velocity of 42 km/s.|$|R
50|$|Girls {{take part}} in {{worshiping}} the celestials (拜仙) during rituals. They go to the local temple to pray to Zhinü for wisdom. Paper items are usually burned as offerings. Girls may recite traditional prayers for dexterity in needlework, which symbolize the traditional talents <b>of</b> <b>a</b> good spouse. Divination could take place to determine possible dexterity in needlework. They make wishes for marrying someone who {{would be a good}} and loving husband. During the festival, girls make <b>a</b> display <b>of</b> their domestic skills. Traditionally, there would be contests amongst those who attempted to be the best in threading needles under low-light conditions like <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ember or a half moon. Today, girls sometimes gather toiletries in honor of the seven maidens.|$|R

The reflection in the water was perfect and lit up with startling distinctness the whole eastern horizon.|$|E
40|$|The ESCA (electron {{spectroscopy}} {{for chemical}} analysis) spectra of films of Tedlar, tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer (in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Teflon FEP coating on Kapton H, i. e., Kapton F), and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon or Teflon TFE), exposed to atomic oxygen O(3 P) either in LEO on the STS- 8 Space Shuttle or within or downstream from a radio-frequency oxygen plasma, were compared. The major difference in surface chemistry of Tedlar {{induced by the}} various exposures to O(3 P) was a much larger uptake of oxygen when etched either in or out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> O 2 plasma than when etched in LEO. In contrast, Kapton F exhibited very little surface oxidation during {{any of the three}} different exposures to O(3 P), while Teflon was scarcely oxidized...|$|R

60|$|A man now entered, in {{neglected}} attire, {{with the}} aspect of a thinker, but somewhat too rough-hewn and brawny for a scholar. His face was full of sturdy vigor, with some finer and keener attribute beneath. Though harsh at first, it was tempered with <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large, warm heart, which had force enough to heat his powerful intellect through and through. He advanced to the Intelligencer {{and looked at him}} with a glance of such stern sincerity that perhaps few secrets were beyond its scope.|$|E
60|$|One of them {{dropped the}} window nearest him and looked out. He {{could see the}} faint glistening of a rain-washed lantern near the wheelers' heads, {{mingling}} with the stronger coach lights, and <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distant open cabin door through the leaves and branches of the roadside. The sound of falling rain on the roof, a soft swaying of wind-tossed trees, and an impatient movement on the box-seat were all they heard. Then Yuba Bill's voice rose again, apparently in answer to the other.|$|E
60|$|The revellers {{were making}} the circuit of the town, with lanthorns {{fluttering}} in the wind, and flickering torches held up aloft illumining laughing faces, red with <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drunken joy, young faces that only enjoyed the moment's pleasure, serious ones that withheld a frown at thought of the morrow. The fitful light played on the grotesque masques of beasts and reptiles, on the diamond necklace of a very earthly goddess, on God's glorious spoils from gardens and country-side, on smothered anxiety and repressed cruelty.|$|E
50|$|The two {{components}} {{of this system}} have <b>an</b> angular separation <b>of</b> 0.25 arcseconds.

60|$|She lay {{smiling at}} him in the canvas lounge, very pretty and very dainty, with {{conventional}} indifference expressed even in her pose. She was, he fancied, a woman who knew her world thoroughly, and had the greater influence therein because she seldom asked too much from it. Then he glanced again at her portrait almost incredulously, for it showed the little shapely head held well erect, the red lips straightened and firmly closed, and <b>the</b> <b>glow</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strenuous purpose in the eyes. Stooping, he laid the picture on her knees with a little smile.|$|E
60|$|She {{paused for}} a moment on the threshold, and her {{flashing}} black eyes seemed to take in every detail of the little scene.
