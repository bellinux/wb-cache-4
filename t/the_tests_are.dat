5|$|Toxicology testing, {{also known}} as safety testing, is {{conducted}} by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs, or by contract animal testing facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences, {{on behalf of a}} wide variety of customers. According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.|$|E
5|$|Most {{animals are}} euthanized after {{being used in}} an experiment. Sources of {{laboratory}} animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority {{are caught in the}} wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights and some animal welfare organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.|$|E
25|$|As an {{instrument}} of systemic reform, <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> targeted to items and skills not currently in the curriculum to promote adoption of methods such as constructivist mathematics, inquiry-based science, and problem solving.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> finally produced. Trial {{questions}} are included and various versions of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>are</b> prepared to avoid cheating. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{announced}} <b>the</b> following year, but {{the full}} results and documentation of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> not declassified until 30 April 1982.|$|R

25|$|The LaF (Lëtzebuergesch als Friemsprooch – Luxembourgish as a Foreign Language) {{is a set}} of four {{language}} proficiency certifications for Luxembourgish and follows the ALTE framework of language examination standards. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> administered by the Institut National des Langues Luxembourg.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a reserve}} forces {{commando}} course run {{for members of the}} Royal Marines Reserve and commando units of the Army Reserve. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the same as for the AACC above. The Army Reserve was previously known as the Territorial Army (TA).|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{applied to}} a {{contingency}} table containing two rows and two columns, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to a Z-test of proportions.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{possible}} outcome of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> would <b>be</b> negative-positive {{meaning that the}} initial phase of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> negative indicating competence in the deep and communicating veins and {{the second phase of}} <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> positive meaning that there is superficial vein incompetence.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} Frank Wilcoxon (1892-1965) who, {{in a single}} paper, {{proposed}} both it and <b>the</b> rank-sum <b>test</b> for two independent samples (Wilcoxon, 1945). <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> popularized by Sidney Siegel (1956) in his influential textbook on non-parametric statistics. Siegel used the symbol T for a value related to, but not the same as, [...] In consequence, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>the</b> Wilcoxon T <b>test,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>test</b> statistic <b>is</b> reported as a value of T ...|$|R
25|$|Following its development, the Hopi missile was flight-tested on the China Lake weapons range during 1958. The missile was test-fired from {{a variety}} of aircraft, {{including}} the North American FJ-4 Fury, Douglas AD Skyraider, Douglas A3D Skywarrior and Douglas A4D Skyhawk. However, no details of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> known to have survived, and the Hopi project was cancelled shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctor will}} perform a {{neurological}} examination to assess nerve function and motor and sensory skills. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{designed to determine}} any functional limitations, such as difficulty with handwriting {{or the ability to}} hold a utensil or cup. The patient may be asked to place a finger on the tip of her or his nose, draw a spiral, or perform other tasks or exercises.|$|E
25|$|Ford Motor Company was the McKinley Climatic Laboratory's {{customer}} {{for three}} weeks in August 2015, beginning 7 August. Engineers from Ford's headquarters in Flint, Michigan, and from Mexico arrived to test everything from the smallest Fiesta to the largest Super Duty trucks. Ford has been testing here for a decade, and has contracts {{for the next three}} years. The lab's schedule is almost full through 2020. About half of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> government, the rest private firms.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> completed, <b>the</b> {{insulating}} oil is stirred automatically and <b>the</b> <b>test</b> sequence <b>is</b> performed repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Administration of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> {{takes about}} 35-50 {{minutes for the}} paper-and-pencil version and about 30 minutes by computer. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> {{instructions}} <b>are</b> simple and straightforward and <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> un-timed; thus, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> generally self-administrable {{and can be used}} in either an individual or a group setting. <b>The</b> 16PF <b>test</b> <b>was</b> designed for adults at least age 16 and older, but there <b>are</b> also parallel <b>tests</b> for various younger age ranges (e.g., the 16PF Adolescent Personality Questionnaire).|$|R
30|$|The brine/oil {{ratio was}} 90 / 10 in these <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> {{hydrocarbon}} used in <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>was</b> an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (Isopar M). <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> run for 18  h. At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> coupons <b>were</b> wiped clean, briefly immersed in inhibited acid solution and then weighed. The corrosion rate was measured using weight loss.|$|R
25|$|Confirmation of the {{diagnosis}} is made {{with the help of}} tests such as endoscopies or barium contrast x-rays. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> typically ordered if the symptoms do not resolve after a few weeks of treatment, or when they first appear in a person who is over age 45 or who has other symptoms such as weight loss, because stomach cancer can cause similar symptoms. Also, when severe ulcers resist treatment, particularly if a person has several ulcers or the ulcers are in unusual places, a doctor may suspect an underlying condition that causes the stomach to overproduce acid.|$|E
25|$|International cricket— Test and One Day International. Adelaide Oval hosts some of {{the many}} {{exciting}} events in the cricketing calendar— including the annual Australia Day One Day International on 26 January (replacing a traditional Australia Day test) and every 4 years, one of the 5 Ashes test matches against England. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> now normally held in early December and is a clash between Australia and the international touring team of that particular season. In 2011, Adelaide Oval held its first Twenty20 International between Australia and England, a match which England won by 1 wicket.The Adelaide Oval was the host of the first ever day/night Test match, when Australia played New Zealand on the 27th of November 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{final test}} {{considered}} by the Court of Appeal was the inherent tendency test. This test entailed examining whether the words complained of have an inherent tendency {{to interfere with the}} administration of justice. Although the inherent tendency test was subsequently referred to in several High Court decisions, the Court of Appeal opined that there was no clear authority for the test. Further, the Court noted that the inherent tendency test had been ambiguously articulated in Wain as that case had not considered the precise relationship between the concepts of inherent tendency and real risk. Consequently, in subsequent cases the High Court had interpreted the concepts as distinct tests. The Court of Appeal held, however, that a holistic reading of Wain suggests that <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> not different, given that they both evaluate the impact of statements on the public confidence in the administration of justice {{within the context of the}} case at hand.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. and U.K. {{standards}} defining how <b>the</b> <b>test</b> should <b>be</b> performed are ASTM D 3080, AASHTO T236 and BS 1377-7:1990, respectively. For rock <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> generally {{restricted to}} rock with (very) low shear strength. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is,</b> however, standard practice {{to establish the}} shear strength properties of discontinuities in rock.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> an {{intensive}} one. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> totally managed by ICFES and different contracts with companies that transport valuables {{as a way}} to make <b>the</b> <b>test</b> safely delivered to the students and preventing fraudulent results or illegal copying.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{computer-based}} <b>test,</b> results <b>are</b> available instantly {{as soon as}} <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>is</b> completed.|$|R
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise {{meets the}} USS Fearless to bring aboard Mr. Kosinski (Stanley Kamel), a Starfleet {{propulsion}} expert {{who plans to}} run tests on the warp engines to improve their efficiency. With Kosinski is his assistant, an alien being from Tau Alpha C known as the Traveler (Eric Menyuk). As Kosinski and the Traveler explain the tests to the engineering crew, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) quickly grasps what <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> designed to accomplish and the Traveler expresses admiration for his problem-solving abilities. The test quickly goes awry when the Enterprise speeds up, surpassing the known capabilities of warp engines. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship stopped, and the crew find themselves {{on the far side}} of the M33 Galaxy (more than 2.7million light years from the Milky Way, the Enterprises home galaxy). Although Kosinski is pleased with the results, he is reprimanded by Picard and asked to simply redo the process to return home. Crusher attempts to warn Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that during the warp test, the Traveler appeared to [...] "phase," [...] drifting in and out of reality, but Riker dismisses him without listening. However, after Kosinski begins the second test, Crusher and Riker both observe the Traveler again drifting out, appearing more tired. The Enterprise again experiences a burst of speed, and when it stops, the crew cannot determine their position. Picard demands that Kosinski get the crew home.|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the above}} {{laboratory}} tests has 100% sensitivity or specificity for diagnosing infection. Specificity improves when <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> performed in patients in whom clinical suspicion exists. ESR and CRP remain good 1st line tests for screening (high sensitivity, low specificity). [...] Aspiration of the joint remains the test with the highest specificity for confirming infection.|$|E

30|$|Thereby, if <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> significant, {{there was}} a linear {{dependence}} between the dependent variable and the independent ones selected. Therefore, all independent variables, for which <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>was</b> not significant, <b>were</b> removed. <b>The</b> Fisher <b>test</b> <b>was</b> then applied which allows to check {{if the number of}} independent variables is sufficient to describe the dependent variable.|$|R
2500|$|Following this report, the {{techniques}} {{were used by}} the FDA to evaluate the safety of substances such as insecticides and sunscreens and later adopted to screen many other compounds. By Draize's retirement in 1963, and despite never having personally attached his name to any technique, irritancy procedures were commonly known as [...] "the Draize test" [...] To distinguish the target organ, <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> now {{often referred to as}} [...] "the Draize eye test" [...] and [...] "the Draize skin test".|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> controversial. They {{are viewed}} as cruel as well as unscientific by critics because of the {{differences}} between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that [...] "to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement ... the Draize test". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects in vitro are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2006, the AABB, America's Blood Centers and American Red Cross {{recommended}} to the FDA that the deferral period {{for men who}} had sex with other men should be changed to be equivalent with the deferral period for heterosexual's judged to be at risk. The FDA chose to uphold the blood ban. Female sexual partners of MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) are deferred for one year since the last exposure. [...] This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high-risk group. [...] The intent of these policies is to ensure that blood is collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded. [...] The policy was first put in place in 1985.|$|E
