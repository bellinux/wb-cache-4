5000|$|In April 2002, China began {{providing}} daily {{water level}} {{data to the}} MRC during the flood season. Critics noted that the emphasis on [...] "flood control" [...] rather than dry season flows represented an important omission given the concerns prioritized by the Mekong regime. In July 2003, MRC CEO Joern Kristensen reported that China had agreed to scale back its plans to blast rapids by implementing only phase one (of three) of its Upper Mekong Navigation Improvement Project; however, China’s future intentions {{in this area are}} far from certain. One area in which China has been particularly reticent is in providing information about the operation of its dams, rather than just flow data, including refusing to join emergency meetings in 2004. Only in 2005 did China agreed to hold technical discussions directly with the MRC. On 2 June 2005, at the invitation of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Water Resources, MRC CEO Dr. Olivier Cogels and a delegation of the Secretariat's senior staff made the first official visit to Beijing to hold <b>technical</b> <b>consultations</b> under the framework of cooperation between China and the MRC, within the scope of the Mekong Programme.The delegation identified a number of potential areas of cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Communication, Information and Transport. These discussions resulted in China supplying the MRC (beginning in 2007) with 24-hour water level and 12-hour rainfall data for flood forecasts in exchange for monthly flow data from the MRC Secretariat. The incentives for China to enter into cooperative regimes on the Mekong are substantially reduced by the alternative of the Salween River as a commercial outlet for China’s Yunnan province, made considerably more attractive by requiring negotiation solely with Burma, rather than with four different riparians. News media and official sources often portray China’s joining the Commission as a panacea for resolving the overdevelopment of the Mekong. However, {{there is no indication that}} China’s joining the MRC would provide downstream riparians with any real capacity to challenge China’s development plans, given the dramatic power imbalances exhibited by these countries’ relations with China.|$|E

The study involved a mixed-method (multivariate predictive and multiple case comparison) evaluation of six organizationally similar but spatially different URCs. Data analysis revealed relationships between workspace planning, consultations and innovation process outcomes. Multivariate analyses showed that configurational accessibility, visibility and walking distances significantly affect the frequencies and locations of unprogrammed face-to-face consultations. Cross-case comparisons revealed that URCs featuring overall high configurational accessibility, shorter walking distances and intact territories exhibit higher face-to-face consultation rates, consultation network connectivity, and subjective/objective innovation process outcomes. Implications for research policy, practice and research are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|When {{carrying}} out forensic-psychiatric evaluations on a minor {{who is the}} presumed victim of sexual abuse, one may come across both “false positives” and “false negatives”. These {{may be the result}} of honest mistakes, or are intentionally false, and the result of manipulation and exploitation. False accusations may come about under certain conditions such as in particularly bitter cases of separation and divorce where one of the parents files charges against the other, and is well aware of the untruthfulness of them. In other cases, the adult reports sexual abuse that did not in fact take place, but believes in good faith that it has. Such a parent’s motives are protective in nature. Investigations carried out using inappropriate techniques may result in erroneous conclusions, thus confirming abuse that had, in fact, never taken place. The aim of this study is to examine the phenomenon of false accusations of sexual abuse as a form of revenge by one ex-partner against another, and to offer recommendations as to how to avoid falling into these traps.

There are also a number of designated WHO Collaborating Centers that conduct further research and analysis on information and samples gathered by the NICS. Currently there are 142 NICs in 112 countries around the world and 6 WHO collaborating centers.
