25|$|Americans {{have the}} highest average {{household}} income among OECD nations, and in 2010 had the fourth highest median household income, down from second highest in 2007. According to one analysis middle class incomes in the United States fell into a tie with those in Canada in 2010, and may have fallen behind by 2014, while several other advanced economies have closed the gap in recent years. According to the Census Bureau, inflation-adjusted household income reached an all-time high of $59,039 in 2016, with record gains in recent years. Income inequality is also at record highs, with the top fifth of earners taking home more than 50% of all overall income. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, wealth inequality is at record highs as well; the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. The Boston Consulting Group posited in June 2017 report that 1% of <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> control 70% of country's wealth by 2021.|$|E

In this assurance my mind most perfectly acquiesces, and I confess I feel not the least alarm from the discontents which are to arise from putting people at their ease, nor do I apprehend the destruction of this Empire from giving, by an act of free grace and indulgence, to two millions of my fellow-citizens some share of those rights upon which.

60|$|DEAR SIR:-When I was at Chicago {{two weeks}} ago I saw Mr. Arnold, and from a remark of his I {{inferred}} {{he was thinking of}} the speakership, though I think he was not anxious about it.

If you would like to be Speaker go right up and see Arnold. He is talented, a practised debater, and, I think, would do himself more credit on the floor than in the Speaker's seat. Go and see him; and if you think fit, show him this letter.|$|E
60|$|The Japanese {{are firmly}} persuaded {{that they have}} no friends, and that the Americana are their implacable foes. One gathers that the Government regards war with America as {{unavoidable}} in the long run. The argument would be that the economic imperialism of the United States will not tolerate the industrial development of a formidable rival in the Pacific, and that sooner or later the Japanese will be presented with the alternative of dying by starvation or on the battlefield. Then Bushido will come into play, and will lead to choice of the battlefield in preference to starvation. Admiral Sato[91] (the Japanese Bernhardi, as he is called) maintains that absence of Bushido in <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> lead to their defeat, and that their money-grubbing souls will be incapable of enduring the hardships and privations of a long war. This, of course, is romantic nonsense. Bushido is no use in modern war, and the Americans are quite as courageous and obstinate as the Japanese. A war might last ten years, but it would certainly end in the defeat of Japan.|$|E

For, as the tax is levied at our own custom-house, the English exporter only receives the same price as formerly, though the American consumer pays a higher one. If, therefore, there be any diminution of the quantity bought, although a larger sum of money may be actually {{laid out in the}} article, a smaller one will be due from the United States to England: this sum will no longer be an equivalent for the sum due from England to the United States for corn, the balance therefore must be paid in money. Prices will fall in England and rise in the United States; iron will fall in the English market; corn will rise in the American. The English will pay a higher price for corn, and will have smaller money incomes to buy it with; while <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> obtain iron cheaper, that is, its price will exceed what it previously was by less than the amount of the duty, while their means of purchasing it will be increased by the increase of their money incomes.|$|E
60|$|I am {{of opinion}} that <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> show no unwillingness {{to pay the}} amount of {{taxation}} which must be exacted from them; and I also think that as regards their actual means {{they will have the}} power to pay it. But as regards their power of obtaining access to those means, I must confess that I see many difficulties in their way. In the first place they have no financier, no man who by natural aptitude and by long-continued contact with great questions of finance, has enabled himself to handle the money affairs of a nation with a master's hand. In saying this I do not intend to impute any blame to Mr. Chase, the present Secretary of the Treasury. Of his ability to do the work properly had he received the proper training, I am not able to judge. It is not that Mr. Chase is incapable. He may be capable or incapable. But it is that he has not had the education of a national financier, and that he has no one at his elbow to help him who has had that advantage.|$|E
60|$|Tour ministers, {{in their}} own and his Majesty's name, have already adopted the American {{distinction}} of internal and external duties. It is a distinction, whatever merit it may have, that was originally moved by the Americans themselves; and I think they will acquiesce in it, {{if they are not}} pushed with too much logic and too little sense, in all the consequences: that is, if external taxation be understood, as they and you understand it, when you please, to be not a distinction of geography, but of policy; that it is a power for regulating trade, and not for supporting establishments. The distinction, which is as nothing with regard to right, is of most weighty consideration in practice. Recover your old ground, and your old tranquillity; try it; I am persuaded <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>will</b> compromise with you.
