The two stowaway on a ship to the Citadel, though are uncovered and turned over to C-Sec once they arrive. Though they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of the evidence they have found, they are ignored and told to leave the Citadel. Later, they are suddenly attacked by Jacobus, injuring Tali and mortally wounding Keenah. After being chased through the Citadel, Tali eventually traps Jacobus in an incinerator, killing him, though Keenah collapses and dies.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the zero}} gravity scenes were handled by Pacific Data Images, while phaser beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that had contributed to The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, they would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story with only one. Cheap animatics provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots of the USS Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E

People <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E

He added, [...] "People like the [...] media always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that we're mainstream. [...] Did you see that Simpsons episode? Chuck Liddell signs an autograph for somebody, and he says, 'That will be $45, please'. The sport isn't like that at all. Then the promoter of the show fights Marge Simpson in the octagon, sucker-punches her in the face, and then says, 'You're the only woman I've ever hit that I didn't love'. That's the way mainstream looks at us and thinks of us, and I know that." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2014, David Cage {{discussed}} {{the future of}} video games and referred to the generally negative reviews Beyond received from hardcore gamers. [...] "There will always be games for the hardcore gamers who see games as a skill-based sport, or {{as a way to}} compete with their friends", he said. He also referred to casual gamers who play games [...] "as a mere hobby, like many titles for smartphones". He then stated, [...] "We try to develop a middle way, with games that <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story, to carry meaning, and where violence isn't the core activity. Most of all, we try to create an emotion, to make players live something strong and unique, which remains an ambitious challenge in a video game." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Stolen Eagle" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer and co-creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said {{the era of the}} Roman Empire was [...] "pivotal in Western history. If things hadn't turned out the way they did at that particular point, the world that we live in now would be very different." [...] He decided {{to tell the story of}} the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just from my point of view. Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy {{has never really}} done anything particularly special for the last episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a complete story in this episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family Guy can be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E

Kenneth Partridge of The Boombox praised the performance writing that [...] "the R megastar is all growls and snarling glances". He further stated that she looked like [...] "a triumphant rock 'n' roll goddess" [...] while performing [...] "I Care". A writer of The Huffington Post praised the performance writing that [...] "'I Care'... showcases an impressive amount of Beyonce-ness. As she belts the lyrics 'You see these tears falling down to my ears/ I swear you like when I'm in pain/ I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you all my fears/ You still don't care?/ That's okay,' Beyonce bedazzles in a sparkly getup and an impressive amount of hair-whipping."

500|$|Elton John, the English {{singer and}} songwriter, {{appears as a}} guest vocalist for Chef's song, {{in one of the}} {{earliest}} celebrity spoof appearances on South Park; Trey Parker, who provided the voice for Elton John, said many people thought it was the actual John singing because his impression was so accurate. In another musical reference featured in the episode, several characters claim the real-life Canadian rock group Loverboy wrote a song {{about the fact that the}} DNA of an elephant and pig will not splice. [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films. When the boys <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Officer Barbrady about the clone, he suggests that the boys have seen too many episodes of the X-Files. In the scene in which Pip is introduced, Stan asks Pip about his peculiar name, but Cartman interrupts Pip during his answer. Pip's reply – [...] "my father's family name being Pirrip and my Christian name Phillip, my infant tongue--" [...] – is identical to the opening line of the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations, which is narrated by its protagonist, Pip. The fourth season episode [...] "Pip" [...] is a parody and comedic retelling of the novel, and stars Pip, who assumes the role of his namesake.|$|E

The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience.

[...] "That is a flagrant assault on free speech." [...] Opponents, represented by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Association of Biology Teachers, contended that his statement is not just ironic, but hypocritical, as the Discovery Institute opposes methodological naturalism, the basic principle that limits science to natural phenomena and natural causes without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, which by definition is beyond natural explanation.|$|E
