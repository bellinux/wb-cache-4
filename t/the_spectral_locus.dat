Monochromatic beams that avoid diffractive spreading require two-dimensional transverse profiles, {{and there are no}} corresponding solutions for profiles restricted to one transverse dimension.

40|$|We {{measured}} the regions in isoluminant color space over which observers perceive red, yellow, green, {{and blue and}} examined {{the extent to which}} the colors vary in perceived amount within these regions. We compared color scaling of various isoluminant stimuli by using large spots, which activate all cone types, to that with tiny spots in the central foveola, where S cones, and thus S opponent (So) cell activity, are largely or entirely absent. The addition of So input to that from the L and M opponent cells changes the chromatic appearance of all colors, affecting each primary color in different chromatic regions in the directions and by the amount predicted by our color model. Shifts from white to the various chromatic stimuli we used produced sinusoidal variations in cone activation as a function of color angle for each cone type and in the responses of lateral geniculate cells. However, psychophysical color-scaling functions for 2 ° spots were nonsinusoidal, being much more peaked. The color-scaling functions are well fit by sine waves raised to exponents between 1 and 3. The same is true for the color responses of a large subpopulation of striate cortex cells. The narrow color tuning, the discrepancies between <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>loci</b> of <b>the</b> peaks of the color-scaling curves and those of lateral geniculate cells, and the changes in color appearance produced by eliminating So input provide evidence for a cortical processing stage at which the color axes are rotated by a combination of the outputs of So cells with those of L and M opponent cells in the manner that we postulated earlier. There seems to be an expansive response nonlinearity at this stage...|$|R

50|$|The six color spaces use RGB color {{primaries}} from {{an alternative}} of two sets called AP0 and AP1 respectively (“ACES Primaries” #0 and #1); more specifically their chromaticity coordinates follow the table below.AP0 {{is defined as}} the smallest set of primaries that encloses the whole CIE 1964 standard-observer spectral locus; thus theoretically including, and exceeding, all the color stimuli that can be seen by the average human eye. The concept of using non-realizable or imaginary primaries is not new, and is often employed with color systems that wish to render a larger portion of the visible spectral locus. The ProPhoto RGB (developed by Kodak) and the ARRI Wide Gamut (developed by Arri) are two of such color spaces. Values outside <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>locus</b> are maintained with the assumption that they will later be manipulated through color timing or in other cases of image interchange to eventually lie within the locus.

5000|$|The idea of optimal colors was {{introduced}} by the Baltic German Chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. Erwin Schrödinger showed in his 1919 article [...] (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity) that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full. Thus two types of [...] "optimal color" [...] spectra are possible: Either the transition goes from zero {{at both ends of}} the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right, or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle. The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, but are generally less saturated. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but generally less saturated than) the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, leading to magenta-like colors. Schrödinger's work was further developed by David MacAdam and Siegfried Rösch. MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the MacAdam limit. On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds or minutes. The MacAdam limit, on which the most saturated (or [...] "optimal") colors reside, shows that colors that are near monochromatic colors can only be achieved at very low luminance levels, except for yellows, because a mixture of the wavelengths from the long straight-line portion of <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>locus</b> between green and red will combine to make a color very close to a monochromatic yellow.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Because {{cerebral}} cortex {{has a very}} large number of testosterone receptors, we examined the possible sex differences in color appearance of monochromatic lights across the visible spectrum. There is a history of men and women perceiving color differently. However, all of these studies deal with higher cognitive functions which may be culture-biased. We study basic visual functions, such as color appearance, without reference to any objects. We present here a detailed analysis of sex differences in primary chromatic sensations. Methods We tested large groups of young adults with normal vision, including spatial and temporal resolution, and stereopsis. Based on standard color-screening and anomaloscope data, we excluded all color-deficient observers. Stimuli were equi-luminant monochromatic lights across the spectrum. They were foveally-viewed flashes presented against a dark background. The elicited sensations were measured using magnitude estimation of hue and saturation. When the only permitted hue terms are red (R) yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B), alone or in combination, such hue descriptions are language-independent and the hue and saturation values can be used to derive a wide range of color-discrimination functions. Results There were relatively small but clear and significant, differences between males and females in the hue sensations elicited by almost the entire spectrum. Generally, males required a slightly longer wavelength to experience the same hue as did females. <b>The</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>loci</b> of <b>the</b> unique hues are not correlated with anomaloscope matches; these matches are directly determined by <b>the</b> <b>spectral</b> sensitivities of L- and M-cones (genes for these cones are on the X-chromosomes). Nor are there correlations between loci of pairs of unique hues (R, Y, G, B). Wavelength-discrimination functions derived from the scaling data show that males have a broader range of poorer discrimination in the middle of the spectrum. The precise values for all the data depend on whether Newtonian or Maxwellian optics were used, but the sex differences were the same for both optical systems. Conclusion As with our associated paper on spatio-temporal vision, there are marked sex differences in color vision. The color-appearances we measured are determined by inputs from thalamic neurons (LGN) to individual neurons in primary visual cortex. This convergence from LGN to cortex is guided by the cortex during embryogenesis. We hypothesize that testosterone plays a major role, somehow leading to different connectivities for males and females: color appearance requires a re-combination and re-weighting of neuronal inputs from the LGN to the cortex, which, as we show, depends on the sex of the participant. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} properties {{of color are}} usually described by their spectra, eigenvector expansions or low-dimensional descriptors such as RGB or CIE-Lab. In {{the first part of}} the paper we show that many of the traditional methods can be unified in a framework where color spectra are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space that are described by projections onto low-dimensional spaces. We derive some fundamental geometrical properties of the subset of the Hilbert space formed by all color spectra. We describe the projection operators that map the elements of the Hilbert space to elements in a finite dimensional vector space. This leads to a generalization of <b>the</b> concepts of <b>spectral</b> <b>locus</b> and purple line. It will be shown that for geometrical reasons the color space is topologically equivalent to a cone. In the second part of the paper we illustrate the theoretical concepts with four large databases of spectra from color systems and a series of multi-spectral images of natural scenes. We verify the conical property of color space for these databases and compute their, geometrically defined, <b>spectral</b> <b>locus</b> and chromaticity properties. In the last section we relate the natural co-ordinate system in the conical color space to the traditional polar co-ordinates in CIE-Lab. We show that there is a good agreement between the geometrically defined hue-variable and the angular part of the polar co-ordinate system in CIE-Lab. There is also a clear correlation between the geometrical and the CIE-Lab saturation descriptors. 1...|$|R
