Elderly residing at nursing homes experience more stress and depression that eventually affect {{their quality of life}} compared to elderly living in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> Meanwhile, social support can promote elderly’s quality of life. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to compare quality of life, social support and depression among old people living in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> and nursing home residents. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in Gilan, north of Iran, 2014 to 2015. Participants in this study were collected using convenience sampling method and composed of 108 individuals (equal numbers of elderly living in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> and nursing home residents). Data were collected using three questionnaires including SF- 12 Quality of Life, Voux Social Support Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA. (Finding: Results of the present study revealed that elderly living in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> had better quality of life (F= 288. 358, p< 0. 01), higher social support (F= 185. 589, p< 0. 01) and lower Depression (X= 302. 266, p< 0. 001) in comparison to elderly residing in nursing home. Conclusion: According to the results of the current study, it is better to accommodate elderly in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> till last day of their life. This is due to the fact that old people are more dynamic in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> would be able to take care of children, maintaine their relationships and receive support from family members...|$|R
