The authority of <b>the</b> <b>Federation</b> is constantly challenged — in part by those who helped to create it, and the further away from the Federal center a person is, the less <b>the</b> <b>Federation</b> can influence their day-to-day lives.

The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to <b>the</b> <b>Federation.</b> The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should <b>the</b> <b>Federation</b> impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to <b>the</b> <b>Federation</b> is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E
