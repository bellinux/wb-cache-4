40|$|Abstract: Nonlinear {{analysis}} of the steady-state load-bearing capacity of steel tubular and the steady-state load-bearing capacity of scaffold was simulated by ANSYS considering semi-rigid connection and pole in different flat. Quantitative standard of the steady-state load-bearing capacity to the steel tubular and the steel <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffold</b> with couplers is used in ANSYS. The effect of semi-rigid connection on the overall steady-state load-bearing capacity of the steel <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffold</b> with couplers is great. The effect of pole in different flat on the overall steady-state load-bearing capacity of the steel <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffold</b> with couplers is smaller. It’s generally recognized that nodes of vertical bars and horizontal bars of steel <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffold</b> by fasteners is not rigid, but semi-rigid; {{is not in the}} same plane, but in a different surface.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop a {{prosthetic}} graft that could perform as a small diameter vascular conduit. We compared hyaluronic acid based <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffold</b> (HYAFF- 11 ™, 1. 5 x 0. 2 cm) with same dimension acellular artery grafts. Male Wistar rats weighing 250 – 350 g were used. A segment of abdominal aorta (1. 5 cm) was incised and, in a group of 30 animals, a HYAFF 11 ™ tube was anastomized. Acellular artery grafts were implanted in a separate group of 30 control animals. Histological, immunohistochemical (antibodies to von Willebrand factor, CD 34, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 and to Myosin Light Chain Kinase) and ultrastructural analysis were used to evaluate the results at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 days after surgery. Results demonstrated advantages using HYAFF 11 ™ tube as compared with the use of arterial graft. HYAFF- 11 ™ tube permitted a prompt endothelialization, followed by a sequential regeneration of the other vascular components that leads to a complete vascular wall regeneration after 15 days from surgery, allowing a 95 % patency rate. On the contrary acellular graft led to an high rate of aneurismatic dilatation and of occlusion, allowing only a 25 % patency rate. Temporariness of the hyaluronic acid tube was another important novel finding: biomaterial was entirely degraded after 4 months from implantation, and after that, a new artery remained to connect artery stumps.

The development of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds with localized and sustained intra-luminal antithrombotic drug release could be considered a desirable improvement towards a valuable solution for this relevant clinical need. For this aim, we present the fabrication and characterization of aspirin-loaded electrospun poly(ε-caprolactone) tubular scaffolds as a vascular drug-delivery graft. Three different drug concentrations were considered (i. e., 1, 5 or 10 % w/w). Although a fibrous structure was clearly observed for all the collected scaffolds, aspirin content was directly implied in the final microstructure leading to a bimodal fiber diameter distribution and fused fibers at crossing-points (5 or 10 % w/w). Mechanical response highlighted a direct relationship for modulus and stress at break with the aspirin content, while the elongation at break was not remarkably different for the investigated cases. The temporal drug release was strongly dependent from the amount of loaded aspirin, reaching a steady state release after about 50 h. Finally, the adhesion assay confirmed the capability of the electrospun scaffolds to reduce platelet adhesion/aggregation onto aspirin loaded polymeric fibers.

Gel swelling and stability, and rheological and uniaxial stretch tests on different percentages of alginate and gelatin demonstrate the gel ability to resist to biochemical microenvironment, to well withstand physiological deformations (~ 10 %) and wall shear stresses (5 - 20 dyne/cm 2).

We aimed at investigating the use of fibroin, a biodegradable protein derived from silk, as an acellular vascular graft for in vivo recellularization. Methods: We produced small caliber fibroin matrices by electrospinning to replace small arterial segments. Electrospun fibroin scaffolds were implanted into the abdominal aorta of Lewis rats by end-to-end anastomosis. Seven days after implantation, fibroin matrices were recovered and processed for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Fibroin matrices allowed host cell infiltration, extracellular matrix remodeling, and ensured good patency of the grafts in the short term. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were present in the explanted construct. Development of an elastic lamina adjacent to the lumen of the scaffold was observed with organization of intima and media layers. Vasa-vasorum were also present in the outer layer of the fibroin material. Conclusions: Our results indicate that formation of vascular tissue containing elastin occurs already at 7 days after implantation on fibroin scaffold without in vitro cellularization. The use of an acellular electrospun silk fibroin <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffold</b> could be a promising strategy for in vivo regeneration of vascular tissue in the clinical reality...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tubular</b> <b>scaffolds</b> with aligned {{polylactic acid}} (PLA) fibres were {{fabricated}} for cell guide applications by immersing rolled PLA fibre mats into a polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) solution to bind the mats. The PVAc solution was also mixed {{with up to}} 30 wt % β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) content. Cross-sectional images of the scaffold materials obtained via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the aligned fibre morphology along with {{a significant number of}} voids in between the bundles of fibres. The addition of β-TCP into the scaffolds {{played an important role in}} increasing the void content from 17. 1 % to 25. 3 % for the 30 wt % β-TCP loading, which was measured via micro-CT (µCT) analysis. Furthermore, µCT analyses revealed the distribution of aggregated β-TCP particles in between the various PLA fibre layers of the scaffold. The compressive modulus properties of the scaffolds increased from 66 MPa to 83 MPa and the compressive strength properties decreased from 67 MPa to 41 MPa for the 30 wt % β-TCP content scaffold. The scaffolds produced were observed to change into a soft and flexible form which demonstrated shape recovery properties after immersion in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) media at 37 °C for 24 h. The cytocompatibility studies (using MG- 63 human osteosarcoma cell line) revealed preferential cell proliferation along the longitudinal direction of the fibres as compared to the control tissue culture plastic. The manufacturing process highlighted above reveals a simple process for inducing controlled cell alignment and varying porosity features within <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolds</b> for potential tissue engineering applications...|$|R
3000|$|Between other {{important}} applications are tissue engineering and drug delivery. In tissue engineering, the ECNF material must be biocompatible. For example, poly(l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) {{has been used}} to fabricate electrospun <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolds</b> for tissue engineered vascular grafts [149]. Another vascular application was reported by He et al. [150]. They demonstrated in an in vitro study that the incorporation of electrospun collagen-blended poly(l-lactic acid)-co-poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds enhances human coronary artery endothelial cell viability, spreading, and attachment, while also preserving the endothelial cell phenotype [...]. Other emergent developments in tissue engineering based on electrospinning are focused on potential scaffolds for ligaments [151], tendons [152], and bones [153], thanks to the alignment and the mechanical properties of the ECNFs.|$|R

Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment for these patients. To address this problem, we are using both tissue engineering and gene transfer principles to develop an orally implantable, artificial fluid-secreting device. In the present study, we examined the tissue compatibility of two biodegradable substrata potentially useful in fabricating such a device. We implanted in Balb/c mice <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolds</b> of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), poly-glycolic acid coated with PLLA (PGA/PLLA), or nothing (sham-operated controls) either beneath the skin on the back, a site widely used in earlier toxicity and biocompatibility studies, or adjacent to the buccal mucosa, a site quite different functionally and immunologically. At 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days postimplantation, implant sites were examined histologically, and systemic responses were assessed by conventional clinical chemistry and hematology analyses. Inflammatory responses in the connective tissue were similar regardless of site or type of polymer implant used. However, inflammatory reactions were shorter and without epithelioid and giant cells in sham-operated controls. Also, biodegradation proceeded more slowly with the PLLA tubules than with the PGA/PLLA tubules. No significant changes in clinical chemistry and hematology were seen due to the implantation of <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolds.</b> These results indicate that the tissue responses to PLLA and PGA/PLLA scaffolds are generally similar in areas subjacent to skin in the back and oral cavity. However, these studies also identified several potentially significant concerns that must be addressed prior to initiating any clinical applications of this device...|$|R
