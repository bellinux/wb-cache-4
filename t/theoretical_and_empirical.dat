5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). <b>Theoretical</b> <b>and</b> <b>empirical</b> studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>and</b> <b>empirical</b> arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

2500|$|The genetic {{homogeneity}} of insect colonies makes them theoretically susceptible to infection en masse; the high similarity {{of each group}} members genome means that each is susceptible (and resistant) to the same parasites, whilst experimental manipulation has demonstrated that genetically heterogenous colonies of B. terrestris have lower levels of parasite infection than homogenous colonies. To increase genetic diversity, colonies can {{increase the number of}} queens and/or increase the number of mating partners a queen has— it is thought these social immune benefits may explain the seemingly costly polyandry found in social insect colonies. Social Hymenoptera also have exceptionally high rates of meiotic recombination when compared against a wide range of higher eukaryote taxa which further increases genetic diversity. [...] Ongoing <b>theoretical</b> <b>and</b> <b>empirical</b> work is seeking to tease out the scenarios in which these immune benefits of genetic heterogeneity can be negated due to concomitant costs, e.g., the increased intra-colony conflict and/or susceptibility to an increasing number of parasites which comes with increased genetic diversity.|$|E
2500|$|In Eros and Civilization, Herbert Marcuse is {{critical}} of Fromm: in the beginning he was a radical [...] theorist, but later he turned to conformity. Marcuse also noted that Fromm, {{as well as his}} close colleagues Sullivan and Karen Horney, removed Freud's libido theory and other radical concepts, which thus reduced psychoanalysis to a set of idealist ethics, which only embrace the status quo. Fromm's response, in both The Sane Society and in The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness, argues that Freud indeed deserves substantial credit for recognizing the central importance of the unconscious, but also that he tended to reify his own concepts that depicted the self as the passive outcome of instinct and social control, with minimal volition or variability. Fromm argues that later scholars such as Marcuse accepted these concepts as dogma, whereas social psychology requires a more dynamic <b>theoretical</b> <b>and</b> <b>empirical</b> approach. In reference to Fromm's leftist political activism as a public intellectual, Noam Chomsky said [...] "I liked Fromm's attitudes but thought his work was pretty superficial".|$|E
