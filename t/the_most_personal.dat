25|$|Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Clark saw {{service in}} the American Revolutionary War before {{volunteering}} for the voyage to Australia. Arriving in New South Wales in January 1788, he filled a number of roles in the newly established colony, including serving on picket duty, guarding convicts, and on the Criminal Court. Having been temporarily promoted {{to the rank of}} first lieutenant, Clark was sent to Norfolk Island aboard HMS Sirius in March 1790, which was subsequently wrecked off the island's coast. After a period on the island, he returned to England aboard HMS Gorgon, arriving in June 1792, and was then posted to the West Indies to fight in the French Revolutionary Wars, dying in a battle off the coast of Hispaniola in June 1794. Clark's diaries, although never intended to be published, provide some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>personal</b> information about the early convict era in Australia, and are currently held by the State Library of New South Wales.|$|E

25|$|Spanning {{a period}} from 9 March 1787 to 17 June 1792, {{although}} with occasional gaps, Clark's diaries {{are some of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>personal</b> writings still in existence from {{the early history of}} the colonisation of Australia. His original journal is thought to have contained three notebooks, although the second of these, spanning the period from 11 March 1788 to 14 February 1790, is thought to have been lost. Clark also had a letterbook, in which many of his letters, both to his family and to other officers, were pasted. These letters were generally written in a more formal style. After his death, Clark's diaries and papers were preserved by his wife's family in Devon. They were auctioned by his great-nephew, Frederick Adolphus Trevan, at Sotheby's in London in May 1914, along with some of the letters of Captain Cook. Purchased by the State Library of New South Wales as three separate volumes, the journal was disbound during the 1920s and compiled into a single volume. However, in 2002, funded by the Nelson Meers Foundation, the pages were removed from their mounts and rebound into four volumes with soft vellum covers. The diary was also digitised. The journal is written in ink on thin, unruled diary paper, and is 312 pages in length.|$|E
