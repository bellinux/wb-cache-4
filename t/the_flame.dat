Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within <b>the</b> <b>Flame.</b> He discovers that Pandora herself is the key to pacifying <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> and allowing him to open the Box.

5|$|The {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not {{closely related to}} either the European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by BirdLife International as Near Threatened, the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.|$|E
5|$|When perched {{or between}} bouts of {{foraging}} on the ground, <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> robin holds {{itself in a}} relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45° or less from the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking its wings alternately when still. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.|$|E

5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought <b>the</b> <b>Flame.</b> Realizing the key to pacifying <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by <b>the</b> <b>Flame)</b> is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench <b>the</b> <b>Flame,</b> but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E

5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony.

They may also fly at intruders or sing to defend their territory.|$|E
