In general, the findings show a continuation of evolutionary trends that are emerging from around the Lower into Middle Pleistocene. Along with changes in the robustness of cranial and dental features, a remarkable increase in brain size from H. erectus towards H. heidelbergensis is noticeable.|$|E
25|$|Jurchen {{script was}} based on the Khitan script, {{inspired}} in turn by Chinese characters. Apparently, both semantic and phonetic borrowing took place. Many Jurchen characters can be described as copies, or distorted copies of, Chinese and/or large-script Khitan characters with similar meaning; others apparently were derived from Chinese characters whose sound was similar to that of Jurchen words, without semantic connection. <b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> few Jurchen characters whose shapes can be related to the Khitan small-character script; however, the idea of using phonetic symbols for grammatical endings, for phonetics transcription of Chinese loanwords, or for writing words for which there were no special ideograms, may have been inspired by the Khitan small-character script.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} nanoflares might heat the corona was {{proposed}} by Eugene Parker in the 1980s {{but is still}} controversial. In particular, ultraviolet telescopes such as TRACE and SOHO/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light, but <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too few of these small events {{to account for the}} energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the TRACE data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The seven-year WMAP {{data were}} {{released}} on January 26, 2010. As {{part of this}} release, claims for inconsistencies with the standard model were investigated. Most were shown not to be statistically significant, and likely due to a posteriori selection (where one sees a weird deviation, but fails to consider properly how hard one has been looking; a deviation with 1:1000 likelihood will typically be found if one tries one thousand times). For the deviations that do remain, there are no alternative cosmological ideas (for instance, <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> correlations with the ecliptic pole). It seems most likely these are due to other effects, with the report mentioning uncertainties in the precise beam shape and other possible small remaining instrumental and analysis issues.|$|E

25|$|In 1928, the Benbow Dam {{was built}} across the South Fork near Benbow, California, {{which led to}} the {{creation}} of a slackwater pool, Benbow Lake, and the creation of the Benbow Lake State Recreation Area. Currently, during the rainy season, the floodgates of the dam are opened, and the lake is nonexistent. The lake only exists during the summer, when lower flows are impounded behind the structure for recreation. However, as the stagnant water in the lake is typically heated by the sun to a higher temperature than normal, when it is released downstream it severely hurts salmon and steelhead runs, as well as other aquatic and migratory life. State plans to decommission the dam are underway, although its removal would severely hurt local economy. Since 2009 the dam was no longer erected, and <b>there</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no plans to build the lake in future years. Dam decommissioning is occurring at the nearby Klamath, and other dams are soon to follow. The dam at Benbow Lake does not need to be decommissioned since it is only a seasonal structure when erected.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that culture {{influences}} how we measure happiness and leisure. While SWB is a commonly used measure of happiness in North America and Europe, {{this may not be}} the case internationally. Quality of life (QOL) may be a better measure of happiness and leisure in Asian countries, especially Korea. Countries such as China and Japan may require a different measurement of happiness, as societal differences may influence the concept of happiness (i.e. economic variables, cultural practices, and social networks) beyond what QOL is able to measure. <b>There</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some differences in leisure preference cross-culturally. Within the Croatian culture, family related leisure activities may enhance SWB across a large spectrum of ages ranging from adolescent to older adults, in both women and men. Active socializing and visiting cultural events are also associated with high levels of SWB across varying age and gender. Italians seem to prefer social conceptions of leisure as opposed to individualistic conceptions. Although different groups of individuals may prefer varying types and amount of leisure activity, this variability is likely due to the differing motivations and goals that an individual intends to fulfill with their leisure time.|$|E
