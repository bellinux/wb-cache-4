5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|Lang {{continued}} to visit Oxford when time allowed {{and on a}} visit to All Souls in June 1893 he was offered the post of Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College. Other offers were open to him; the Bishop of Newcastle wished to appoint him vicar of the cathedral church in Newcastle and Benjamin Jowett wished him to return to Balliol as a tutor in theology. Lang chose Magdalen; <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in charge of young men who might in the future achieve positions of responsibility was attractive to him and, in October 1893, with many regrets, he left Leeds.|$|E

5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|Trevor Francis, {{who joined}} Birmingham as a 15-year-old, {{became the first}} British footballer to be {{transferred}} for a fee of at least £1million when Brian Clough signed him for league champions Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The basic fee was below £1m – Clough claimed in his autobiography to have set the fee at £999,999 {{because he did not}} want <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the first £1m player going to Francis's head – but VAT and the transfer levy raised the total payable to £1.18m. Within three months he scored the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup Final. Some four years earlier, Birmingham had also been involved in a British record transfer when they sold Bob Latchford to Everton, in part exchange for Howard Kendall and Archie Styles, the deal valuing Latchford at £350,000.|$|E
5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> treated like a second-class citizen was anathema {{and could not be}} tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E

25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> receptive partners during anal sex {{because they believe}} it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number.

25|$|Louis I was {{succeeded in}} 1382 by his daughter, Mary. However, most noblemen opposed <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{ruled by a}} female monarch.

Although the Diet forced the queen to abdicate and elected Charles of Naples king, the queen's partisans murdered him in February 1386. Paul Horvat, Bishop of Zagreb initiated a new rebellion and declared his infant son, Ladislaus of Naples king. They captured the queen in July 1386, but her supporters proposed the crown to her husband, Sigismund of Luxemburg. Queen Mary was soon liberated, but she never again intervened in the government.|$|E
25|$|On January 18, 1709, Esther was {{enrolled}} as a boarding {{student in the}} Ursuline boarding school. She was {{proving to be a}} good student, excelling in music, languages, grammar and embroidery. She deepened her interest for Catholicism, especially for its mysticism component. After having been with the Ursulines for 18 months as a pupil, she asked to become a nun. Father Bigot, who had spent some time with the girl previously, sponsored her entry and used his influence to get her accepted by the Ursulines. He was particularly attached to the young girl, convinced of his own triumph at turning a Puritan girl into a devoted Catholic. However, Vaudreuil that had dealt her return to her family, intervened and took her back to his residence the following fall with the intention to fulfill his promise. Convinced of her future vocation as a nun, Esther was reluctant to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sent back to her Puritan origins. Fortunately for her, the plan did not follow through and, in June 1711, she was sent to the Hôtel-Dieu, where she spent several months. The place was also sheltering other English captives among whom she met two of her own cousins, Mary Silver and Esther Sayward. Although Esther was eventually sent to Trois-Rivières, where the Ursulines were looking forward having her, the young girl decided she rather preferred to be placed with the Ursulines of Québec City.|$|E
