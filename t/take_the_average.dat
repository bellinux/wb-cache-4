500|$|The Witness is {{a puzzle}} {{adventure}} game, {{experienced in the}} first-person view. The player, as an unnamed character, explores an island with numerous structures and natural formations. The island is roughly divided into eleven sections, arranged around a mountain that represents the ultimate goal for the player. Within each section is a gold box that must be reached to activate it, requiring the player to complete a sequence of puzzles within that section to reach it. Once activated, a turret emerges from the box and shines a light towards {{the top of the}} mountain, indicating that section is complete. The player needs to activate some of the boxes in the game to be able to access the inside of the mountain and ultimately reach the game's final goal, though additional puzzles can be discovered if all eleven turrets are activated. There are additional optional puzzles scattered around the island. One optional set of puzzles, accessible after entering the mountain and colloquially referred to as [...] "The Challenge", is a time-based test to complete about a dozen algorithmically-generated mazes within seven minutes, set to music from Edvard Grieg's [...] "Anitra's Dance" [...] and [...] "In the Hall of the Mountain King".

60|$|Here {{we see an}} intelligible {{relation}} between {{the character of the}} river basin and the amount of denudation. The Mississippi has a large portion of its basin in an arid country, and its sources are either in forest-clad plateaux or in mountains free from glaciers and with a scanty rainfall. The Danube flows through Eastern Europe where the rainfall is considerably less than in the west, while comparatively few of its tributaries rise among the loftiest Alps. The proportionate amounts of denudation being then what we might expect, and as all are probably under rather than over the truth, we may safely <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> of them all as representing an amount of denudation which, if not true for the whole land surface of the globe, will certainly be so for a very considerable proportion of it. This average is almost exactly one foot in three thousand years.[34] The mean altitude of the several {105} continents has been recently estimated by Mr. John Murray,[35] to be as follows: Europe 939 feet, Asia 3,189 feet, Africa 2020 feet, North America 1,888 feet, and South America 2,078 feet. At the rate of denudation above given, it results that, were no other forces at work, Europe would be planed down to the sea-level in about two million eight hundred thousand years; while if we take a somewhat slower rate for North America, that continent might last about four or five million years.[36] This also implies that the mean height of these continents would have been about double what it is now three million and five million years ago respectively: and as {{we have no reason to}} suppose this to have been the case, we are led to infer the constant action of that upheaving force which the presence of sedimentary formations even on the highest mountains also demonstrates.|$|E

6000|$|It follows, therefore, {{that from}} {{the time when the}} ancestral man first walked erect, with hands freed from any active part in locomotion, and when his brain-power became {{sufficient}} to cause him to use his hands in making weapons and tools, houses and clothing, to use fire for cooking, and to plant seeds or roots to supply himself with stores of food, the power of natural selection would cease to act in producing modifications of his body, but would continuously advance his mind through the development of its organ, the brain. Hence man may have become truly man--the species, Homo sapiens--even in the Miocene period; and while all other mammals were becoming modified from age to age under the influence of ever-changing physical and biological conditions, he would be advancing mainly in intelligence, but perhaps also in stature, and by that advance alone would be able to maintain himself as the master of all other animals and as the most widespread occupier of the earth. It is quite in accordance with this view that we find the most pronounced distinction between man and the anthropoid apes in the size and complexity of his brain. Thus, Professor Huxley tells us that [...] "it may be doubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed less than 31 or 32 ounces, or that the heaviest gorilla brain has exceeded 20 ounces," [...] although [...] "a full-grown gorilla is probably pretty nearly twice as heavy as a Bosjes man, or as many an European woman."[226] The average human brain, however, weighs 48 or 49 ounces, and if we <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> ape brain at only 2 ounces less than the very largest gorilla's brain, or 18 ounces, we shall see better the enormous increase which has taken place in the brain of man since the time when he branched off from the apes; and this increase will be still greater if we consider that the brains of apes, like those of all other mammals, have also increased from earlier to later geological times.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} place, because first {{in order of}} realisation, there is its value as a mental bouleversement, a {{revolution}} in ideas, a sort of moral and intellectual cold shower-bath, a nervous shock to the system generally.

The sun that shifts now north, now south of him; the seasons that go by fours instead of twos; the trees that blossom and bear fruit from January to December, with no apparent regard for the calendar months as by law established; the black, brown, or yellow people, who know not his creed or his social code; the castes and cross-divisions that puzzle and surprise him; the pride and the scruples, deeper than those of civilised life, but that nevertheless run counter to his own; the economic conditions that defy his preconceptions; the virtues and the vices that equally rub him up the wrong way--all these things are highly conducive to the production of that first substratum of philosophic thinking, a Socratic attitude of supreme ignorance, a pure Cartesian frame of universal doubt.|$|E

60|$|I {{visited the}} little towns of Lexington and Frankfort, in Kentucky. At the former I {{found in the}} hotel to which I went seventy-five teamsters {{belonging}} to the army. They were hanging about the great hall when I entered, and clustering round the stove {{in the middle of}} the chamber; a dirty, rough, quaint set of men, clothed in a wonderful variety of garbs, but not disorderly or loud. The landlord apologized for their presence, alleging that other accommodation could not be found for them in the town. He received, he said, a dollar a day for feeding them, and for supplying them with a place in which they could lie down. It did not pay him, but what could he do? Such an apology from an American landlord was in itself a surprising fact. Such high functionaries are, as a rule, men inclined to tell a traveler that if he does not like the guests among whom he finds himself, he may go elsewhere. But this landlord had as yet filled the place for not more than two or three weeks, and was unused to the dignity of his position. While I was at supper, the seventy-five teamsters were summoned into the common eating-room by a loud gong, and sat down to their meal at the public table. They were very dirty; I doubt whether I ever saw dirtier men; but they were orderly and well behaved, and but for their extreme dirt might have passed as the ordinary occupants of a well- filled hotel in the West. Such men, in the States, are less clumsy with their knives and forks, less astray in an unused position, more intelligent in adapting themselves to a new life than are Englishmen of the same rank. It is always the same story. With us there is no level of society. Men stand on a long staircase, but the crowd congregates near the bottom, and the lower steps are very broad. In America men stand upon a common platform, but the platform is raised above the ground, though it does not approach in height the top of our staircase. If we <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> altitude in the two countries, we shall find that the American heads are the more elevated of the two. I conceived rather an affection for those dirty teamsters; they answered me civilly when I spoke to them, and sat in quietness, smoking their pipes, with a dull and dirty but orderly demeanor.|$|E
60|$|I sat {{for some}} time motionless, trying to turn over in my mind all that she had said to me; but {{it seemed as though}} my faculties were utterly obliterated in despair. Eva had been to me almost as a daughter, and yet I was {{compelled}} to refuse her request for her father's life. And when she had {{told me that it was}} my pride and vanity which had made me do so, I could not explain to her that they were not the cause. And, indeed, was I sure of myself that it was not so? I had flattered myself that I did it for the public good; but was I sure that obduracy did not come from my anxiety to be counted with Columbus and Galileo? or if not that, was there not something personal to myself in my desire that I should be known as one who had benefited my species? In considering such matters, it is so hard to separate the motives,--to say how much springs from some glorious longing to assist others in their struggle upwards in humanity, and how much again from mean personal ambition. I had thought that I had done it all in order that the failing strength of old age might be relieved, and that the race might from age to age be improved. But I now doubted myself, and feared lest that vanity of which Eva had spoken to me had overcome me. With my wife and son I could still be brave,--even with Crasweller I could be constant and hard; but to be obdurate with Eva was indeed a struggle. And when she told me that I did so through pride, I found it very hard to bear. And yet it was not that I was angry with the child. I became more and more attached to her the more loudly she spoke on behalf of her father. Her very indignation endeared me to her, and made me feel how excellent she was, how noble a wife she would be for my son. But was I to give way after all? Having brought the matter to such a pitch, was I to give up everything to the prayers of a girl? I was well aware even then that my theory was true. The old and effete should go, in order that the strong and manlike might rise in their places and do the work of the world with the wealth of the world at their command. <b>Take</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> of mankind all round, and there would be but the lessening of a year or two from the life of them all. Even taking those men who had arrived at twenty-five, to how few are allotted more than forty years of life! But yet how large a proportion of the wealth of the world remains in the hands of those who have passed that age, and are unable from senile imbecility to employ that wealth as it should be used! As I thought of this, I said to myself that Eva's prayers might not avail, and I did take some comfort to myself in thinking that all was done for the sake of posterity. And then, again, when I thought of her prayers, and of those stern words which had followed her prayers,--of that charge of pride and vanity,--I did tell myself that pride and vanity were not absent.|$|E
