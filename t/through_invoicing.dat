So, each tuple in the Invoice relvar will have one Order No, which implies that there is precisely one Order for each Invoice. But in reality an invoice can be created against many orders, or indeed for no particular order. Additionally the Order relvar contains an Invoice No attribute, implying that each Order has a corresponding Invoice. But again {{this is not always}} true in the real world. An order is sometimes paid <b>through</b> several <b>invoices,</b> and sometimes paid without an invoice. In other words, there can be many Invoices per Order and many Orders per Invoice. This is a many-to-many relationship between Order and Invoice (also called a non-specific relationship).

40|$|Background and problem: Recent {{research}} has raised several questions regarding IT {{costs and benefits}} {{that must be addressed}} (Grover & Kohli, 2012). Carr (2003) argues that firms have spent too much on IT and overestimated the strategic value of IT. Xue et al. (2012) explains the “productivity paradox” of IT investments. Furthermore, the investment made in IT puts increasing pressure on management to justify the outlay by quantifying the business value of IT (Mukhopadhyay, Kekre, & Kalathur, 1995). Barua et al. (1995) states that an important management question is whether the anticipated economic benefits of IT are being realized. Researchers explain that the business value of IT is gained from synergies through cost savings and more flexible business solutions (van den Hoven, 2006; Cho & Shaw, 2009) but {{research has}} also highlighted that it is hard for firms to keep control of the IT costs (Brynjolfsson & Hitt, 2000) and it becomes even harder to keep control (Dyche, 2012). Purpose: The purpose is to contribute to earlier research by answering the following research question: how do firms identify and allocate IT cost? Methodology: Qualitative research is conducted. An initial literature review was made to establish a conceptual model for the semi-structured interviews. The result was then analysed according to a content analysis approach. Small sequences of the data were analysed at a time {{to be able to get}} in depth analysis. Results and conclusions: There is a clear spread from no classifications of IT costs to several different categories corresponding to strategy and responsibility. There exist differences regarding the identification of direct IT costs throughout the firms, but the primary method of identification is made <b>through</b> <b>invoices</b> received. In traditional IT cost models indirect costs are often overlooked. Firms with an innovative IT cost model use several steps and methods for identifying IT costs to specific resources whereas traditional models only identifies such costs when there is an associated invoice. Allocation to cost centres involves several different important aspects to take into account and firms have incentives for increasing the IT cost transparency. A best practice model was developed to assist firms in their work. Suggestions for future research: Future research may focus on the wider extent of the process of identifying and allocating IT cost. The proposed framework for categorizing firms regarding the maturity level of their IT cost model may provide an avenue for future research to explain differences in IT cost controlling performance...|$|R
40|$|Early {{mobile phones}} only {{provided}} voice transmission, for a fee. They have now evolved into voice and online data portals for providing additional services through 3 rd party vendors. These service providers (vendors) are {{given access to}} a customer base "owned" by the mobile phone companies, for a fee. Typically customers make two payments: to the mobile phone company for phone services and to the 3 rd party vendors for specific services bought from them. Variations to the above business model may involve outsourcing the online portal and/or acquiring customers from other independent portals. For these scenarios, we study how the fees for phone service and customer access are established and how they may relate to the prices of vendor services, and which services should be located on the portal - all in a game-theoretic context. Our results prove {{that it is possible}} to reorganize revenue flows <b>through</b> an <b>invoicing</b> process that may benefit the mobile network operator more than the other parties. In addition, we establish optimality in terms of the number of vendors on the portal, and determine a rank-ordering of vendors for their inclusion into the portal.

40|$|International audienceWith the {{emerging}} of cloud computing, offering software as a Service {{appears to be}} an opportunity for software vendors. Indeed, using an on-demand model of provisioning service can improve their competitiveness <b>through</b> an <b>invoicing</b> tailored to customer needs. Virtualization has greatly assisted {{the emerging}} of on-demand based cloud platforms. Up until now, despite the huge number of projects around cloud platforms such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service, less open research activities around SaaS platforms have been carried on. This is the reason why our contribution in this work is to design an open framework that enables the implementation of on-demand SaaS clouds over a high-performance computing cluster. We have first focused on the framework design and from that have proposed an architecture that relies on a virtual infrastructure manager named OpenNebula. OpenNebula permits to deal with virtual machines life-cycle management, and is especially useful on large scale infrastructures such as clusters and grids. The work being a part of an industrial project, we have then considered a case where the cluster is shared among several applications owned by distinct software providers. After studying in a previous work how to implement the sharing of an infrastructure in such a context, we now propose policies and algorithms for scheduling jobs. In order to evaluate the framework, we have evaluated a prototype experimentally simulating various workload scenarios. Results have shown its ability to achieve the expected goals, while being reliable, robust and efficient...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe write emails, {{listen to}} music online, pay an <b>invoice</b> <b>through</b> {{internet}} banking, and have an eID. These all are e-services. But how can we define an e-service? Numerous definitions of e-services generalize their essence, reflect the specific characteristics and certain elements of their production process. They are important for economic theory and practice, {{but none of them}} have acquired general acceptance. Supranational institutions, scientists and researchers attempt to seek one definition. A lot of definitions explain e-services only as e-government, e-learning and e-commerce. It is insufficient for further classification. We pay attention to classification of e-services in this chapter. Some of them divided e-services according to the branch, processes etc. Classification as e-co model, e-ladder, E-Diamond model, classification of service and product to the dimensions in a 2 * 2 matrix, and fulfilment-product classification have been introduced. The main goal of our study is to provide an extensive review of e-service definitions and classifications. Based on the findings we propose our own classification of e-services. The result of our work is a new 3 D model. The 3 D model is constructed according to bases of stages models and Diamond model, but we respect also user's needs and their fulfilment in process. In this empirical analysis of e-service definitions and classifications, we have compared known definitions and classifications and proposed a new model. Most models and schemes only deal with public e-services. We bring a new perspective, the classification is intended for all known e-services...|$|R

Whether they did it {{under the influence of}} CDM Smith executives and agents in India (the agents also bribed NHAI officials) would be clear after the reply is received from U.S. Department of Justice and when executives and agents of CDM Smith in India would be confronted in the light of new facts/ evidences, which are emerging almost every single day. People involved in the case are speaking up and coming forward with the existing facts, which were hitherto unknown in public domain. Fresh enquiries in other related matters {{have been ordered}} by other Indian authorities/ departments. After the raid dated July 9, 2017 by the DGCEI, the internal audit team of CDM Smith Inc, USA visited company's Bangalore office and after thorough enquiry confirmed the tax evasion pattern. By March 2016 CDM Smith fired the country head and other top officials of CDM Smith India Private Limited and CDM Smith Inc in India. Later they confessed before the USA authorities that their India branch office and CDM Smith India Private Limited generated fake service <b>invoices</b> <b>through</b> their sub-contractors and the generated cash was used to bribe NHAI officials. On June 21, 2017 (signed by CDM Smith on June 29, 2017) the US Justice Department settled the case in respect of CDM Smith relating to corruption, whereby the company accepted that they had paid $1.18 million to the Government Officials in India, but the company showed its resolve for fighting corruption by sacking its country manager and other executives in India. These executives were found involved in the corruption scandal. Mr P. Hariharan was the country manager of CDM Smith in India at the time. Mr Hariharan joined Rodic consultants Private Limited in March 2016 after getting terminated from CDM Smith, and remained with that company till January 2017. Mr P. Hariharan was with CDM Smith from February 2011 to March 2016 as Vice President and country-manager (India sub-continent business). The external affairs ministry of Government of India has asked U.S. Department of Justice to provide details of the case and has asked for the names of Indian officials to whom bribes were paid by the agents and executives of CDM Smith in violation of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of USA. [...] In July 2017, CDM Smith agreed to pay around $4 million, the profit that it earned through the fake service invoices used in generating cash for bribing Government Officials in India, to the US Treasury.|$|R
