50|$|<b>Treehoppers</b> (more {{precisely}} typical <b>treehoppers</b> {{to distinguish}} {{them from the}} Aetalionidae) and thorn bugs {{are members of the}} family Membracidae, a group of insects related to the cicadas and the leafhoppers. About 3,200 species of <b>treehoppers</b> in over 400 genera are known. They are found on all continents except Antarctica; only three species are known from Europe. Individual <b>treehoppers</b> usually live for only a few months.|$|R
50|$|The {{diversity}} of <b>treehoppers</b> {{has been little}} researched, and their systematic arrangement is tentative. It seems three main lineages can be distinguished; the Endoiastinae are the most ancient <b>treehoppers,</b> still somewhat resembling cicadas. Centrotinae form the second group; they are somewhat more advanced but the pronotum still does not cover the scutellum in almost all of these. The Darninae, Heteronotinae, Membracinae and Smiliinae contain the most apomorphic <b>treehoppers.</b>|$|R

50|$|They {{have been}} {{recorded}} to tend species of <b>treehopper,</b> plant sap-feeding insects, during the daytime, {{an example of a}} mutualistic relationship. The wasp protects the <b>treehopper</b> nymphs from predators and parasites and in return feeds on honeydew which is produced by the nymphs. At night the carpenter ant species, Camponotus atriceps will tend the nymphs. During the day, P. apicalis will attack these ants, preventing them from tending the treehoppers. Each wasp is loyal to one group of <b>treehopper</b> nymphs, and will only leave them for less than 10 minutes at a time. The closely related species, Parachartergus fraternus also tends treehoppers.|$|E

40|$|Social {{behaviour}} in {{the form}} of parental care is widespread among insects but the evolutionary histories of these traits are poorly known {{due to the lack of}} detailed life history data and reliable phylogenies. <b>Treehoppers</b> (Hemiptera: Membracidae) provide some of the best studied examples of parental care in insects in which maternal care involving egg guarding occurs frequently. The Membracinae exhibit the entire range of social behaviour found in the <b>treehoppers,</b> ranging from asocial solitary individuals, nymphal or adult aggregations, to highly developed maternal care with parent–offspring communication. Within the subfamily, subsocial behaviour occurs in at least four of the five tribes. The Aconophorini and Hoplophorionini are uniformly subsocial, but the Membracini is a mixture of subsocial and gregarious species. The Hypsoprorini contains both solitary and gregarious species. Accessory secretions are used by many <b>treehoppers</b> to cover egg masses inserted into plant tissue while oviposition on plant surfaces is restricted to a few species. Presumed aposematic colouration of nymphs and teneral adults appears to be restricted to gregarious and subsocial taxa. Ant mutualism is widespread among membracine <b>treehoppers</b> and may play an important role in the evolutionary development of subsocial behaviour. The life history information provides a basis for comparative analyses of maternal care evolution and its correlation with ant mutualism in membracine <b>treehoppers.</b> The results show that there is a strong phylogenetic component to the evolution of maternal care in membracine <b>treehoppers,</b> and provide the first quantitative evidence of correlated evolution of maternal care and ant mutualism in <b>treehoppers.</b> Further research on natural history, particularly of the tropical fauna, will be necessary to better understand the evolution of social behaviour and life history in <b>treehoppers...</b>|$|R

50|$|Many Auchenorrhyncha {{including}} {{representatives of}} the cicadas, leafhoppers, <b>treehoppers,</b> planthoppers, and froghoppers are adapted for jumping (saltation). <b>Treehoppers,</b> for example, jump by rapidly depressing their hind legs. Before jumping, the hind legs are raised and the femora are pressed tightly into curved indentations in the coxae. <b>Treehoppers</b> can attain a take-off velocity of up to 2.7 metres per second and an acceleration of up to 250 g. The instantaneous power output {{is much greater than}} that of normal muscle, implying that energy is stored and released to catapult the insect into the air. Cicadas, which are much larger, extend their hind legs for a jump in under a millisecond, again implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|R
50|$|<b>Treehoppers</b> pierce plant stems {{with their}} beaks and feed upon sap. The young can {{frequently}} {{be found on}} herbaceous shrubs and grasses, while the adults more often frequent hardwood tree species. Excess sap becomes concentrated as honeydew, which often attracts ants. Some species have a well-developed ant mutualism, and these species are normally gregarious as well, which attracts more ants. The ants provide protection from predators. <b>Treehoppers</b> mimic thorns to prevent predators from spotting them.|$|R
2500|$|Polistes eythrocephalus is not {{commonly}} {{observed to}} tend or collect honeydew from aetalionids (<b>treehoppers)</b> {{or any other}} insect species. [...] Honeydew is {{a good source of}} carbohydrates, composed of a mixture of oligosaccharides. This mixture provides those that eat it with an energy source higher than that of floral nectar. [...] However, in one study done in Peru researchers observed a single female P. erythrocephalus among an aggregation of Aetalion reticulatum (<b>treehoppers).</b> [...] The female P. erythrocephalus stood among or below the <b>treehoppers</b> and touched them with her antennae. [...] Though they did not directly feed her, the honeydew accumulated below where the A. reticulatum were standing. P. erythrocephalus then collected the honeydew from the branch. This research provides the first bit of evidence that P. erythrocephalus may tend to aetalionids within its range.|$|R

40|$|Although mutualisms {{have been}} intensively investigated, {{demonstration}} of indirect effects between co-occurring mutualistic systems is rare. For instance, the ecological consequences of co-occurrence of ant-tended insects on a plant {{have never been}} examined for survival effects on either trophobiont species. Here, we assess the selective pressures mediating co-occurrence of a facultative ant-tended butterfly (Parrhasius polibetes) with ant-tended <b>treehoppers</b> (Guayaquila xiphias) on Schefflera vinosa shrubs. We evaluated host plant selection and caterpillar survival in P. polibetes in the presence and absence of ant-treehopper associations. Paired trials revealed that butterflies preferably oviposit on branches hosting ant-tended <b>treehoppers</b> {{when they had a}} choice between those and branches without this interaction. Presence of ant-tended <b>treehoppers</b> on a branch reduced the abundance of P. polibetes' natural enemies and improved caterpillar survival in both premyrmecophylic and ant-tended phases. Thus ant-tended <b>treehoppers</b> create an enemy-free space on foliage that butterflies exploit to protect larval offspring. These findings connect two widely documented ant-trophobiont mutualisms and highlight the importance of considering multiple interactions for a proper understanding of ant-plant-herbivore systems. Detection of other ant-based mutualisms on oviposition to improve offspring survival may have represented an important evolutionary step in the process of host plant selection in facultative myrmecophilous butterflies...|$|R

50|$|Viral {{replication}} is nuclear. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the ssDNA rolling circle model. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear pore export, and tubule-guided viral movement.Dicotyledonous plants serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (<b>treehopper).</b> Transmission routes are vector.|$|E

The bug is gregarious, gathering in large numbers to suck the sap from the stems of plants. Most of its known host species are in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. In its native range in Mexico it is only associated with plants in genus Lantana. It lays eggs on the stems of the plants and then guards them against predators. The nymphs progress through five instars before reaching adulthood in about 45 days.|$|E

50|$|This insect is {{native to}} Mexico, Central America, and Colombia. It {{is best known as}} an import to Australia, where it was {{introduced}} in 1995 as an agent of biological pest control for the invasive plant species lantana (Lantana camara). Since the introduction of the <b>treehopper</b> on lantana, it has also been found in abundance on fiddlewood (Citharexylum spinosum). The propensity of the insect to attack non-target plant species inspired greater attention to testing of potential biocontrol agents before their release. It also suggests the importance of monitoring such releases for longer periods to track their activity.|$|E
50|$|Withania somnifera {{is prone}} to several pests and diseases. Leaf spot disease caused by Alternaria alternata is the most {{prevalent}} disease, which is most severe in the plains of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh. Biodeterioration of its pharmaceutically active components during leaf spot disease has been reported. The Choanephora cucurbitarum causes a stem and leaf rot of Withania somnifera. A <b>treehopper</b> feeds on the apical portions of the stem, making them rough and woody in appearance and brown in colour. The apical leaves are shed and the plant gradually dies. The carmine red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is the most prevalent pest of the plant in India.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} {{structure}} of populations and communities {{has been a}} dominant focus of ecological research, and spatial structure is increasingly seen as critical for understanding population dynamics. Habitat (or host) preference is a proximate mechanism that can generate aggregation or overdispersion, lending insight into the ultimate consequences of observed spatial distributions. Publilia concava is a univoltine phloem-feeding insect that forms mutualistic associations with ants, which consume honeydew and protect treehoppers from predation. <b>Treehopper</b> adults and nymphs are aggregated at the scale of goldenrod plant stems, and previous {{studies have suggested that}} this aggregation is an adaptive response that increases feeding performance or maximizes benefits of ant-tending. Previous studies have also shown experimentally that individual treehoppers preferentially oviposit on plants with ants present, but a complimentary hypothesis that treehoppers prefer to oviposit near conspecifics (e. g., to take advantage of density-dependent ant attraction) remains untested. We show that, as expected, the probability of <b>treehopper</b> oviposition increases with ant-presence and relative ant abundance. However, we also find that <b>treehopper</b> oviposition decreases with increasing <b>treehopper</b> density. Thus our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that <b>treehopper</b> aggregation is a socially cooperative strategy to attract ants; we suggest that aggregation is a form of conflict and an unavoidable by-product of individual responses to ant-tending levels...|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} {{froghopper}} resemble leafhoppers, {{but can be}} distinguished by the possession {{of only a few}} stout spines on the hind tibia, where leafhoppers have a series of small spines. Members of the family Machaerotidae greatly resemble <b>treehoppers,</b> due to a large thoracic spine, but the spine in machaerotids is an enlargement of the scutellum, where <b>treehoppers</b> have the pronotum enlarged. Members of the family Clastopteridae have their wings modified to form false heads at the tail end, an anti-predator adaptation. Many adult Cercopidae can bleed reflexively from their tarsi, and the hemolymph appears to be distasteful; they are often aposematically colored (see photos).|$|R
