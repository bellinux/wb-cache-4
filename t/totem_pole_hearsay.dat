5000|$|In {{the field}} of Conservation of Cultural Heritage, the <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> is {{categorized}} as a wooden object. Although <b>totem</b> <b>poles</b> are generally identified as wooden objects, there are more complex ideologies associated with them. <b>Totem</b> <b>poles</b> [...] "are more than works of art; they embody {{the culture of the}} Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest". Today, conservators must regard the communities from which the poles originated prior to performing any type of assessment or conservation treatment. <b>Totem</b> <b>poles</b> can pose ethical issues in the practice of conservation. These issues may be; spiritual or ceremonial that concern their original communities, or related to provenance. [...] "In recent years more attention has been focused on understanding the perspective of the Native American culture in regards to <b>totem</b> <b>poles,</b> especially by conservators. Instead of approaching the conservation of a <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> with mere intellect some have turned to understanding the spiritual and ceremonial significance".|$|R

The crests carved upon the <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> represent Kwanusila the Thunderbird, a whale with a man on its back, and a sea monster. Many people do not realize that <b>totem</b> <b>poles</b> were only regionally used by First Nations along the coastal areas of British Columbia. Kwanusila is an exact replica of the original Kraft Lincoln Park <b>totem</b> <b>pole,</b> which was donated to the City of Chicago by James L. Kraft on June 20, 1929, and which stood on the spot until October 9, 1985. It was discovered some years before the pole was moved, that a pole of this type {{did not exist in}} the types at the Provincial British Columbia Museum located in Victoria, B.C., Canada. Arrangements were made for a duplicate of the Chicago original to be made by the same Amerindian tribe that made the original. A request was made and approved by the Chicago Park District for the original <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> which existed here to be presented back to British Columbia. Kwanusila is dedicated to the school children of Chicago, and was presented to the City of Chicago by Kraft, Inc. on May 21, 1986.Prominently visible from Lake Shore Drive, the <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> is highlighted on Chicago city maps as a place of interest, visited by residents and tourists alike.

50|$|<b>Totem</b> <b>pole</b> carvings {{were likely}} {{preceded by a}} long history of {{decorative}} carving, with stylistic features borrowed from smaller prototypes. Eighteenth-century explorers documented the existence of decorated interior and exterior house posts prior to 1800; however, {{due to the lack of}} efficient carving tools, sufficient wealth, and leisure time to devote to the craft, the monumental poles placed in front of native homes along the Pacific Northwest coast probably did not appear in large numbers until the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. Trade and settlement initially led to the growth of <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> carving, but governmental policies and practices of acculturation and assimilation sharply reduced <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> production by the end of nineteenth century. Renewed interest from tourists, collectors, and scholars in the 1880s and 1890s helped document and collect the remaining <b>totem</b> <b>poles,</b> but nearly all <b>totem</b> <b>pole</b> making had ceased by 1901. Twentieth-century revivals of the craft, additional research, and continued support from the public have helped establish new interest in this regional artistic tradition.|$|R
