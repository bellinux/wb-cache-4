5|$|Dan Tucker is both <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> {{and subject}} of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on <b>the</b> <b>teller),</b> and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|In January 1898, Spain promised some {{concessions}} to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed. Public attention focused on the crisis and the consensus was that regardless of who set the bomb, Spain had lost control over Cuba. McKinley insisted that a court of inquiry first determine whether the explosion was accidental. Negotiations with Spain continued as the court considered the evidence, but on March 20, {{the court ruled that}} the Maine was blown up by an underwater mine. As pressure for war mounted in Congress, McKinley continued to negotiate for Cuban independence. Spain refused McKinley's proposals, and on April 11, McKinley turned the matter over to Congress. He did not ask for war, but Congress declared war anyway on April 20, with the addition of <b>the</b> <b>Teller</b> Amendment, which disavowed any intention of annexing Cuba.|$|E
50|$|The office {{originated}} in early times as the clerk of the Lord High Treasurer at the Receipt of the Exchequer. He {{was responsible for}} filing and entering <b>the</b> <b>Teller's</b> Bills from <b>the</b> <b>Tellers</b> of <b>the</b> Exchequer, certifying monies received to the Lord Treasurer, and auditing the books of <b>the</b> <b>Tellers.</b> <b>The</b> title of Auditor was officially attached to the post, combined with that of Tally Writer, {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I. In 1826, the duties of the Chamberlains of the Exchequer devolved upon the Auditor. The office was abolished, with several other offices of the ancient Exchequer, on 10 October 1834.|$|R

40|$|Through stories, tellers {{communicate}} their stance toward {{what they are}} reporting. Story recipients rely on different interactional resources to display alignment with the telling activity and affiliation with <b>the</b> <b>teller's</b> stance. In this article, I examine the communication resources participants to tellings rely on to manage displays of alignment and affiliation during the telling. The primary finding is that whereas vocal continuers simply align with the activity in progress, nods also claim access to <b>the</b> <b>teller's</b> stance toward <b>the</b> events (whether directly or indirectly). In mid-telling, when a recipient nods, she or {{he claims to have}} access to <b>the</b> <b>teller's</b> stance toward <b>the</b> event being reported, which in turn conveys preliminary affiliation with <b>the</b> <b>teller's</b> position and that the story is on track toward preferred uptake at story completion. Thus, the concepts of structural alignment and social affiliation are separate interactional issues and are managed by different response tokens in the mid-telling sequential environment...|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; <b>the</b> <b>teller,</b> aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Dark Lady" [...] of the song's {{title is}} a gypsy fortune teller in New Orleans {{with a history}} of misandry (the narrator of the song {{describes}} seeing scratches on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>teller's</b> limousine from her previous conquests). The narrator follows <b>the</b> fortune <b>teller's</b> limousine to her lair and pays money for a fortune; {{as a result of the}} fortune, she learns that her lover has been unfaithful to her with, as the (audibly uncomfortable) fortune teller says, [...] "someone else who is very close to you". Advised to leave <b>the</b> fortune <b>teller's</b> shop, never to return, and to forget she has ever seen <b>the</b> fortune <b>teller's</b> face, <b>the</b> narrator returns home in a state of shock, unable to sleep, and then realizes to her horror that she had once smelled, in her own room, the very perfume <b>the</b> fortune <b>teller</b> had been wearing. Sneaking back to <b>the</b> fortune <b>teller's</b> shop with a gun, she there catches her lover and <b>the</b> fortune <b>teller</b> [...] "laughing and kissing", and shoots them both to death, presumably in a fit of rage.|$|R

25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on experiential {{learning}}, but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E

50|$|In other deliberative assemblies, such as {{voluntary}} associations, {{elections and}} other matters of importance are frequently voted on by ballot. Tellers are appointed to count those ballots. Normally, the chairman appoints <b>the</b> <b>tellers</b> unless <b>the</b> organization's rules provide that tellers are appointed another way, such as appointment of an elections committee. <b>The</b> <b>tellers</b> are chosen for their accuracy and dependability, are not directly involved on what is being voted in, and usually are allowed to vote themselves.|$|R
25|$|Authentication is {{the act of}} verifying a {{claim of}} identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the bank teller he is John Doe—a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photoID, so he hands <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> his driver's license. The bank teller checks the license {{to make sure it}} has John Doe printed on it and compares the {{photograph}} on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.|$|E

50|$|Electronic records {{indicated}} that the intruder opened the vault door at 9:48 a.m. At that time, six vault employees were on duty processing cash deliveries. The intruder demanded that the employees cover their eyes and lie on the floor. He ordered the senior vault manager, David Barranco, to fill a satchel with cash from the work stations. Before leaving the scene, the assailant forced <b>the</b> <b>tellers</b> to crawl into a small room near the vault—otherwise known as a man trap. Confusing investigators, the robber neither filled up the entire bag with money nor took bundles of cash from the vault. The robber made his escape at 9:56 a.m. according to electronic records, leaving <b>the</b> <b>tellers</b> locked in <b>the</b> man trap. Using a broken spoon found on the man trap's door sill, <b>the</b> <b>tellers</b> freed themselves approximately 20 minutes after the robbery.|$|R
25|$|After {{the last}} Spanish troops left {{the island in}} December 1898, the {{government}} of Cuba was temporarily {{handed over to the}} United States on 1 January 1899.

Its main subsidiary, Westernbank, at one time operated 55 bank branches, all insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It had opened two bank branches in the Miramar and Old San Juan sections of the island’s capital, which feature a new information system that allowed bank representatives to perform certain banking transactions with customers at informal places, such as the lobby area, the waiting area, {{and even in the}} customer waiting line for <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> counters.|$|E
25|$|He {{was removed}} from the Westminster {{commission}} of assessment in 1674, and was made a commissioner of the Alienation Office in August 1675, replacing Alexander Halsall. During that year, he was <b>the</b> <b>teller</b> against the adjournment of debate on the King's Speech. He was also appointed to the committee to prevent Roman Catholics from sitting in the Lords and Commons. On 15 July 1676, after the death of Sir Francis Wyndham, Bertie succeeded him as captain of a Horse Guards troop. From Osborne, now Lord Danby and Lord High Treasurer, he continued to receive patronage; in July 1676, Danby appointed him a searcher of customs in London upon the death of George Peake, and from 1677 to 1678, he was the receiver of ship tax in Kent. Not surprisingly, given his official appointments, Bertie was identified by his contemporaries with the court party. In 1678, his younger brother Charles was also returned for Stamford at a by-election.|$|E
500|$|The U.S., {{after the}} Spanish–American War, had many expansionists {{who wanted to}} annex Cuba. Many people felt that a foreign power (outside of the U.S.) would control a portion of Cuba, thus the U.S. could not {{continue}} with its interests in Cuba. Although many advocated annexation, this was prevented by <b>the</b> <b>Teller</b> Amendment, which states [...] "hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government {{and control of the}} island to its people." [...] When summarized, this could mean that the U.S. would not interfere with Cuba and its peoples. The expansionists argued though, that <b>the</b> <b>Teller</b> Amendment was created [...] "ignorant of actual conditions" [...] and that this released the U.S. from its obligation. Following the debate surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Teller</b> Amendment, the Platt Amendment took effect.
