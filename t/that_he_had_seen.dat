5|$|A plaque {{placed on}} the miller's house in 1973 to {{celebrate}} the 100th birthday of miller Gerardus van Hoorn commemorates both fires. Van Hoorn had known the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, who lived in nearby Nuenen from 1883 until 1885. Van Gogh painted several paintings around the mill, including an 1884 painting of the mill itself, Water Mill at Opwetten (F48). In a video interview in 1973, Van Hoorn said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Van Gogh paint and had supplied him with bird nests for his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E

She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} if anyone is out there. She angrily calls Doggett to protest him monitoring her phone conversations, which he seems genuinely surprised about.

5|$|If Hahn's {{account is}} disregarded, the Mascarene parrot {{probably}} became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion {{is from the}} 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens {{are known to have}} lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist François Levaillant stated that the bird was rare and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> three specimens in France.|$|E

5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached.

5|$|What {{happened}} next would {{form the basis}} for decades of both cooperation and dispute between British and American exploration of, and ownership claim to, the region. Royal Navy commander George Vancouver sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed a change in the water's color, but he accepted Meares' report and continued on his journey northward. Later that month, Vancouver encountered the American captain Robert Gray at the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams.

Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{originally}} considered reviving CBS's long-lost {{quiz show}} The $64,000 Question {{for a new}} era, with a new home on ABC. However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire {{was about to make}} its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members, each containing a copy of Millionaires first episode. Davies was so captivated by everything <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and heard, from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E
5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
5|$|The spy {{followed}} the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, {{although no one}} saw any immortals. Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and reported <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> his immortal master {{and that they were}} to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu.

50|$|Reliabilism {{has been}} {{challenged}} by Gettier cases. Another argument that challenges reliabilism, like the Gettier cases (although it was not presented in the same short article as the Gettier cases), {{is the case of}} Henry and the barn façades. In the thought experiment, a man, Henry, is driving along and sees a number of buildings that resemble barns. Based on his perception of one of these, <b>he</b> concludes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just <b>seen</b> barns. While <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> one, and the perception he based his belief <b>that</b> the one <b>he</b> saw was of a real barn, all the other barn-like buildings he saw were façades. Theoretically, Henry does not know <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> a barn, despite both his belief <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> one being true and his belief being formed {{on the basis of a}} reliable process (i.e. his vision), since he only acquired his true belief by accident.|$|R

5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the women again. He acknowledged {{that he was on}} Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{continued}} to conduct marine research after 1934, {{but he felt}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{what he wanted to}} see using the Bathysphere, and that further dives were too expensive for whatever knowledge he gained from them to be worth the cost. With the help of Beebe's friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents of tuna, which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish. Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the Zaca. The goal of this expedition was to study the area's undersea fauna by means of dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there. In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the Zaca, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem. Beebe described his two expeditions on board the Zaca in his books Zaca Venture and The Book of Bays, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.|$|E
5|$|Following {{rumors of}} cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 {{appearing}} on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty, Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters. Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs. The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character. Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance {{was moved to the}} second episode. Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line. Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season. On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries—$40,000 to $50,000 per episode—but when denied she left the show altogether.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E
