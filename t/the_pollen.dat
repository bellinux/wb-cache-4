40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the pattern of <b>the</b> birch atmospheric <b>pollen</b> seasons in Lublin in the period 2001 – 2010. Pollen monitoring was con-ducted using a Lanzoni VPPS 2000 sampler. <b>The</b> atmospheric <b>pollen</b> seasons were determined with the 98 % method. Regression {{analysis was used to}} deter-mine correlations between meteorological conditions and the pattern of <b>the</b> birch <b>pollen</b> season. On average, <b>the</b> birch <b>pollen</b> season started on 12 April, ended on 13 May, and lasted 32 days. The peak value and <b>the</b> Seasonal <b>Pollen</b> Index showed <b>the</b> greatest variation in particular years. All the seasons were right-skewed.

The obtained model fit was at a level of 64 – 81 %.

5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs.

5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> and stigma so that <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination.

30|$|The {{absolute}} {{detection limit}} for maize pollen counting {{is determined by}} the discrete number of one detected <b>pollen</b> grain in <b>the</b> sub-sample for counting.

This is achieved by adjusting the volume of the sub-sample to be analyzed until approx. 3, 000 total pollen grains were counted and maize pollen grains were detected. Using a micropipette, sub-samples (volume, 10 to 50 μl) were taken from <b>the</b> glycerol <b>pollen</b> suspension and <b>the</b> maize <b>pollen</b> grains and total pollen grains were counted.

5|$|Many beetle species {{undertake}} annual mass movements {{which are}} termed as migrations. These include <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> beetle Meligethes aeneus and {{many species of}} coccinellids.

5|$|Various {{plants are}} known to have pollen which is toxic to honey bees, in some cases killing the adults (e.g., Toxicoscordion), in other cases {{creating}} a problem only when passed to the brood (e.g., Heliconia). Other plants which have toxic pollen are Spathodea campanulata and Ochroma lagopus. Both <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> and nectar of the California Buckeye (Aesculus californica) are toxic to honeybees, and it is thought that other members of the Buckeye family are also.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters such as {{the eastern}} spinebill are {{attracted}} to the flowers. As the bird gathers the nectar, <b>the</b> <b>pollen,</b> which has fins, attaches itself to the feathers on {{the heads of the}} birds and is carried to other flowers, aiding cross pollination. A study in forests near Hobart in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area {{at the same time the}} common heath was in flower in March, and left once flowering had finished. Other honeyeaters, {{such as the}} strong-billed, crescent and yellow-throated honeyeaters, fed occasionally at common heath flowers. Field work in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia recorded the white-plumed and New Holland honeyeaters, as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} the German {{academic}} and natural historian Joseph Kölreuter (1733–1806) extended this work by noting {{the function of}} nectar in attracting pollinators {{and the role of}} wind and insects in pollination.

One hundred years after Camerarius, in 1793, Christian Sprengel (1750–1816) broadened the understanding of flowers by describing the role of nectar guides in pollination, the adaptive floral mechanisms used for pollination, and the prevalence of cross-pollination, even though male and female parts are usually together on the same flower.|$|E

5|$|Sycamore trees {{produce their}} flowers in hanging {{branched}} clusters known as panicles that contain {{a variety of}} different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with both male and female organs, but function as if they were unisexual.

All of the flower types can produce pollen, but <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> from functionally female flowers does not germinate.

5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> of seed plants in the fossil record.

5|$|Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is thought}} to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet {{consists}} of nectar, pollen, fruit, seeds, honeydew, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles and spiders. A study of <b>the</b> <b>pollen</b> on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and green spider flower (Grevillea mucronulata).|$|E
