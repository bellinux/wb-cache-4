5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the <b>trust</b> <b>to</b> be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a <b>trust</b> <b>to</b> be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the <b>trust</b> <b>to</b> be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
