Voluntary standardsdeveloped by industry, consumer, and government participants through a consensus processcover many of the thousands of types of products in CPSCs jurisdiction. Compliance with voluntary standards is not routinely tracked, but it is generally considered to be high by industry participants. Compliance with these standards also depends on industry and legal factors, such as retailer requirements to demonstrate proof of compliance with voluntary safety standards and risk of liability in product liability lawsuits. ...|$|E
40|$|Blind to the danger? In 1990 I {{wrote to}} CMAJ regard-ing my unfortunate {{experience}} in-volving the accidental strangulation of toddlers by window-blind cords. 1 Seven years later I was contacted {{about the topic}} by Market Place, a CBC television program, because in-terest had been renewed by {{a recent article in}} another journal. 2 I have been out of general pediatric practice for several years, so it was with dis-may that I found that very little has been done at the manufacturing level to eliminate these totally preventable accidents. Recently there was a huge recall of venetian blinds because of the potential toxicity of their compo-nent materials, but there has been lit-tle or no publicity acknowledging the very real hidden dangers posed by window blind cords. In 1990 I ended my letter with recommendations that safety warn-ings be packaged with the blinds. To-day I realize that those recommenda-tions did not go far enough. We should be advocating for changes to make <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>hazard</b> free, and we should increase awareness of this problem as part of our provision of well-child care in all settings, from homes to day-care centres...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three parts. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we analyze preemptive patenting in a two-stage real options game where an incumbent firm competes with a potential entrant firm for the patent of a substitute product in a product market with profit flow uncertainty. Our patent-investment game model assumes that the entrant has complete information on the incumbent’s commercialization cost while the incumbent only knows the distribution of the entrant’s cost. We investigate the impact of information asymmetry on the preemption strategies adopted by the two competing firms on patenting the substitute product by comparing the optimal preemption strategies and the real option value functions of the two competing firms under complete information and information asymmetry. We also examine how information asymmetry may affect the occurrence of sleeping patent and the corresponding expected duration between the two stages of patenting and product commercialization. In the second part of the thesis, we consider the characterization of strategic equilibria associated with an asymmetric R&D race between an incumbent firm and an entrant firm in the development of a new product with market and technological uncertainty. The random arrival time of the discovery of the patent protected innovative product through R&D effort is modeled as a Poisson process. Input spillover on R&D effort is modeled by the change in the leader’s hazard rate of success of innovation upon follower’s entry into the R&D race. Asymmetry between the two competing firms include sunk costs of investment, stochastic revenue flow rates generated from <b>the</b> <b>product,</b> <b>hazard</b> rates of success of R&D efforts of the two firms. Using real options game models, we analyze the optimal strategies adopted by the two firms in their strategic entry into the R&D phase. The impact of various parameters on the firms’ optimal strategies is also discussed. In the third part of te thesis, we present a single-firm stochastic control problem which the firm is allowed to manage its R&D effort during its R&D stage. We derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman formulation of the problem. We propose an efficient algorithm of solving the equation numerically. The proof of convergence of the numerical scheme is provided. Finally, we examine various economic phenomena associated with optimal control on R&D effort...|$|E

40|$|Two mmSDSs were developed, {{the first}} for two, similar, formaldehyde-based {{embalming}} fluids, the second for a solvent-based paint.   Workplace and laboratory intervention studies were undertaken {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the mmSDSs in increasing knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>hazards</b> and risks; inducing attitudinal and risk perception changes; appropriate protective behaviour and decreasing inhalation exposure.   Subjects received either the mmSDS or the conventional SDS package, with subjects being assessed both pre- and several times post-intervention. Fourteen embalmers participated in the workplace evaluation.   Knowledge increased, with more mmSDS users showing increases at the first post-intervention study.   Cumulative exposure to formaldehyde decreased slightly post-intervention, although there were no significant differences between packages.   There was little change in the use of protective measures due to embalmers already using measures available.   Twenty-four members of the general public participated in a laboratory-based painting study.   None had previously used the paint and knowledge increased for both mmSDS and SDS users.   The mmSDS was more effective at promoting positive changes in the wearing of masks, hand washing and ventilation.   Cumulative exposures to solvents decreased, although there were no statistically significant differences between packages. The impact of the mmSDSs and SDSs interventions on participants’ behaviour and exposure to chemicals was more pronounced in the laboratory study however the majority of the workplace participants were already using all the protective measures available.   Overall, the findings suggest that the mmSDS concept may be an effective method of providing chemical hazard and risk information in the workplace.

30|$|Risk {{assessment}} always {{tries to}} answer the question: how safe is the element at risk? The risk is usually defined by <b>the</b> <b>product</b> of <b>hazard</b> probability and the undesirable consequence of loss: R[*]=[*]H[*]×[*]V[*]×[*]E in which H (stands for hazard) indicates the probability of the occurrence of a hazard, V represents vulnerability to specific hazard intensity, and E is the exposure of the element at risk. This expression shows that risk level {{is closely related to}} the probability and the intensity of hazard. We therefore developed a joint procedure by coupling the Newmark model and the RockFall Analyst model to identify the risk exposure of the object (road) to seismic landslides. Each model accomplishes specific objectives: the Newmark model is used for seismic landslide probability analysis, and the Rockfall Analyst model is used for further unstable mass movement trajectory simulation.|$|R
40|$|Adopting the {{definition}} {{suggested by the}} United Nations, a risk model for regional debris flow assessment is presented. Risk is defined as <b>the</b> <b>product</b> of <b>hazard</b> and vulnerability, {{both of which are}} necessary for evaluation. A Multiple-Factor Composite Assessment Model is developed for quantifying regional debris flow hazard by taking into account eight variables that contribute to debris flow magnitude and its frequency of occurrence. Vulnerability {{is a measure of the}} potential total losses. On a regional scale, it can be measured by the fixed asset, gross domestic product, land resources, population density, as well as the age, education, and wealth of the inhabitants. A nonlinear power-function assessment model that accounts for these indexes is developed. As a case study, the model is applied to compute the hazard, vulnerability and risk for each prefecture of the Yunnan province in southwestern China. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|First, as with UNDHA (1992), {{disaster}} risk {{is a combination}} or function of hazard and vulnerability, most notably variations of <b>the</b> mathematical <b>product</b> of <b>hazard</b> times vulnerability. Wisner et al. (2004, p. 45) refer to {{disaster risk}}[*]=[*]hazard × vulnerability as a “pseudo-equation” suggesting it as a mnemonic {{rather than as a}} meaningful calculation, which matches UNISDR (2004). Wisner et al. (2004) also introduce “capacity” and “mitigation” as reducing disaster risk in the pseudo-equation. Other terms added to <b>the</b> basic hazard-vulnerability <b>product,</b> as an equation and as a mnemonic, are from De La Cruz-Reyna (1996) who places “value (of the threatened area)” in <b>the</b> <b>product,</b> which is then divided by “preparedness,” while Granger et al. (1999) add only “elements at risk” into <b>the</b> <b>product.</b> Peduzzi et al. (2009) apply the latter formulation by specifying “elements at risk” as the number of people experiencing a hazard. In these formulations, “elements at risk” seem to match “exposure,” distinct from vulnerability, as discussed in Sect.  2.2.|$|R

40|$|American courts talk {{as though}} they are {{imposing}} strict enterprise liability on product manufacturers, but in truth they do so only with respect to manufacturing defects. In product design and marketing litigation, manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 liability is based on fault. The reason why strict liability is inappropriate for <b>the</b> generic <b>product</b> <b>hazards</b> associated with design and marketing is that, in sharp contrast to manufacturing defects, the conditions necessary for insurance to function are not satisfied. Users and consumers control generic product risks to a sufficiently great extent that any insurance scheme based on strict enterprise liability would be destroyed by combinations of adverse selection and moral hazard. And yet, here and there, courts are imposing strict liability for harm caused by manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 design and marketing decisions. These 2 ̆ 2 echoes of enterprise liability 2 ̆ 2 involve unique fact patterns in which adverse selection and moral hazard do not threaten the viability of the insurance schemes implicit in liability without fault. In reaching these remarkable outcomes, courts stretch existing doctrine beyond traditional limits. Understanding why these echoes arise and how they rest on unique factual circumstances should help prevent misunderstandings regarding their value as guides to future developments in American products liability...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{illustrate}} a framework for flood risk mapping at pan-European scale produced by the Weather-Driven Natural Hazards (WDNH) action of the EC-JRC-IES. Early results are presented in the form of flood risk index maps. We assess several flood risk factors that contribute to the occurrence of flood disasters. Among the causal factors of a flood disaster one is triggering natural event in the form of extreme precipitation and consequently extreme river discharge and extreme flood water levels. The threatening natural event represents the hazard component in our assessment. Furthermore exposure and vulnerability are anthropogenic factors that contribute also to flood risk. In the proposed approach, flood risk is considered on the light of exposure, vulnerability and hazard. We use a methodology with a marked territorial approach for the assessment of the flood risk. Hence, based on mathematical calculations, risk is <b>the</b> <b>product</b> of <b>hazard,</b> exposure and vulnerability. Improvements on datasets availability and spatial scale are foreseen in next phases of this study.

40|$|Tools {{supporting}} {{the decision-making process}} are necessary when planning nature conservation and performing ecological restoration actions. A decision-support tool for the management plan of Vincheto di Celarda Nature Reserve, based on the relative ecological risk assessment, was developed within the LIFE Project LIFE 04 NAT/IT/ 000190. This method includes: i) the preparation of a georeferenced catalogue of the threats to plant communities and zootopes; ii) the estimation of the hazard level for each threat, i. e. the probability of its occurrence; iii) the estimation of the nature value and vulnerability of plant communities and zootopes, obtained through field surveys, expert judgment and interviews with the reserve managers. By calculating <b>the</b> <b>product</b> of <b>hazard</b> level, value and vulnerability, the method allows analyzing, explicitly and on a spatial scale, the risks, which the species and habitats suffer due to human and natural disturbances, and identifying management options {{to reduce the risk}} level.
