5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating {{what to do with}} him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E
5|$|On her own Tara finds a spell to {{help the}} town get its voices back, and goes out {{to show it to}} Willow. On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E
25|$|Both teams swapped {{field goals}} {{for the first two}} periods. The third was scoreless, despite an {{opportunity}} for Arkansas to shut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> field goal attempt. Arkansas then scored on a Matt Jones run, but failed the two-point conversion, which is required versus an extra point in the third overtime or later. The Volunteers answered the call on their first play, a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tony Brown, but the Volunteers also failed the two, sending the game into a fifth extra period.|$|E

30|$|The head {{protection}} for the rider is greatly enhanced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> equipped <b>with</b> <b>an</b> airbag. <b>The</b> safety performance of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> airbag can effectively meet the requirements for rider’s {{head protection}} and the values of HIC on different opening angles are in the safe range, which proves the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|R
25|$|Frechette, in her {{harboring}} trial testimony, {{said that}} she told Dillinger {{that the police had}} showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated {{down the stairs to the}} front entrance. Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 27, Macleod {{was already}} {{considered}} somewhat {{too old to be}} a platoon commander. Once fit for duty again, he served as a staff captain with the 46th Division in Wye, under the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), Captain Dawtry. In 1941 a drunk Macleod almost killed Dawtry, as the latter had retired to bed rather than play stud poker with him. He shot at his door until his revolver ran out of bullets, and then passed out after smashing down <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy piece of furniture. He demanded an apology the next morning for his refusal to play, although the two men remained friends thereafter. Dawtry later became Chief Clerk of Westminster Council.|$|E
25|$|The SWAT team {{started to}} {{surround}} the bus at 7:37pm. The policemen attempted {{for nearly an}} hour to enter the bus, first by breaking its Plexi glass windows with sledgehammers, pulling <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rope attached to a police vehicle but it snapped. After running out of choices, they threw two canisters of tear gas inside and Mendoza stepped out of the bus. Snipers, who had taken positions earlier in the day, ultimately shot Mendoza in the head after he exited the bus, killing him instantly. By that time, however, four more hostages were confirmed dead, while only six hostages were confirmed alive and not seriously injured. Two other people outside the bus — 47-year-old TVB news crew engineer Wen Ming, and child bystander Mike Ladrillo y Campanero — were wounded by stray bullets.|$|E

25|$|According {{to later}} {{accounts}} by Howe’s daughter, Florence Hall, the Howes’ South Boston {{home was a}} stop on the Underground Railroad. This is uncertain, but it is known that Dr. Howe vehemently opposed the Fugitive Slave Law. Two incidents clearly demonstrate this. The first occurred in 1850, when Dr. Howe along with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Theodore Parker and other abolitionists, stormed Faneuil Hall {{in order to try to}} free a captured escaped slave, Anthony Burns. Burns was going to be sent back to his slave owner in Virginia in accordance with the Fugitive Slave Law. The abolitionists hoped to rescue Burns from that fate. Howe declared outside the hall that “No man’s freedom is safe until all men are free.” Shortly afterward the abolitionists stormed the hall, breaking through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> battering ram. A deputy was accidentally shot in the ensuing fracas. Federal troops finally put an end to the attempted raid, and Burns was returned to Virginia. The men did not abandon Burns, however, and within a year of his capture, they had raised enough money to purchase Burns’ freedom from his slave owner.|$|E
500|$|Nas made {{reference}} to finding his daughter's letter {{to a man in}} jail and the controversy that ensued when she posted a photo of a box of condoms on Instagram. According to Kyle Ellison from Drowned in Sound, Nas also commented on gender expectations in his rap, citing the line [...] "when he date, he straight, chip off his old papa / when she date, we wait behind <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sawed off / 'cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon being dismissed, Borglum wrecked his {{models for}} the monument; the Association sought to have him jailed for {{destruction}} of property. [...] Borglum was addressing the ladies of the Atlanta chapter of the UDC when his assistant, Jesse Tucker, burst in and hurried him out <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minimum of explanation, only moments before a sheriff's deputy arrived to serve the warrant. He left the state, but was arrested in Greensboro, North Carolina, though quickly allowed bail, and the Association abandoned extradition proceedings. Freed, the sculptor soon took up a project in South Dakota, Mount Rushmore. The publicity surrounding these events hurt the Association's fundraising, as did allegations that the Association had misused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars put aside for the project.|$|E
60|$|The new-comer {{regarded}} him tenderly {{for a moment}} without a word, and then, kicking open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unmistakable wooden leg, stumped into the bar, and grasping his outstretched hand shook it fervently.|$|R

500|$|Before the {{production}} began, rock 'n' roll songwriting partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were commissioned {{to create the}} film's soundtrack. The writers, who accepted the work, did not send any material to MGM for months. In April 1957, the studio called {{a meeting with the}} writers in New York City to be updated on the progress of the work. Leiber and Stoller, who had not written any material, traveled to New York where, instead of working, they toured the city. They were confronted in their hotel room by Jean Aberbach, director of Hill & Range music publishing company, who asked to see the songs. When he was told that there was no material, Aberbach decided to lock the songwriters in their hotel room by blocking <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sofa. Aberbach told them that they would not leave the room until they had created the material. Four hours later, Leiber and Stoller had written [...] "I Want to Be Free", [...] "Treat Me Nice", [...] "(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care", and [...] "Jailhouse Rock".|$|E
500|$|The Mari Lwyd {{party would}} {{approach}} {{a house and}} sing a song in which they requested admittance. The inhabitants of the house would then offer excuses for why the team could not enter. The party would sing a second verse, and the debate {{between the two sides}} [...] known as the pwnco [...] would continue until the house's inhabitants ran out of ideas, at which time they were obliged to allow the party entry and to provide them with ale and food. An account from Nantgarw described such a performance, in which the Punch and Judy characters would cause a noise, with Punch tapping the ground to the rhythm of the music and rapping on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poker, while Judy brushed the ground, house walls, and windows with a broom. The householders had to make Punch promise that he would not touch their fireplace before he entered the building, otherwise it was the local custom that before he left he would rake out the fire with his poker. In the case from Llangynwyd, however, there was no interplay between the householders and troupe, but rather the latter were typically granted entry automatically after singing the first verse of their song.|$|E
2500|$|On April 12, 1998 he {{boarded the}} train from Genoa to Venice because he [...] "wanted {{to kill a}} woman". [...] Spotting a young woman {{travelling}} alone, he followed her to the toilet, unlocked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> skeleton key, shot her {{in the head and}} stole her train ticket.|$|E
60|$|We {{were still}} a {{hundred yards from the}} cottage when I saw the tall, green-coated Mr. Corcoran striding down the garden path. My father was waiting for us at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} of subdued delight upon his face.|$|R

2500|$|One day on {{his return}} from a hunting {{expedition}} with a party of Milwaukee men, he found the frame of a mill was already erected within his enclosure. After supper, he proceeded to cut it down, and a moment after it fell, a mob of thirty men, headed by Reynolds appeared with axes. [...] stood in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> double-barreled shot-gun. He pushed Reynolds away several times, but he at last seized a weapon and {{at the point of}} striking, DuBay fired, killing him instantly.|$|E
2500|$|According to Anna Marie West, {{both she}} and Charmaine were {{frequently}} subjected to criticism, beatings, {{and other forms of}} punishment throughout the time they lived under Rose's care at Midland Road, but although she (Anna Marie) was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in relation to the physical and mental hardships she and her sister endured, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude no matter how severely she was beaten or to what punishment she was subjected. Despite the years of neglect and abuse she had endured, Charmaine's spirit had not been broken, and she would talk wistfully to Anna Marie of the belief she held her [...] "mummy will come and save me". Anna Marie would later recollect her sister would repeatedly antagonise Rose by making statements such as: [...] "My real mummy wouldn't swear or shout at us" [...] in response to Rose's scathing profanities. A childhood friend of Charmaine's who had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road named Tracey Giles would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests' flat, unannounced, only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back with a belt, as Rose stood alongside the child with a large wooden spoon in her hand. According to Tracey, Charmaine had been [...] "calm and unconcerned", whereas Anna Marie had been standing by <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blank expression on her face.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{death and}} the {{traditional}} ceremony, the body {{is placed on the}} ground, and covered with a sheet, and {{at the start of the}} traditional ceremony, the body is lifted from the ground onto a special board or slab (a tahara board), so that it lies facing <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white sheet underneath. The clothes are then removed from the corpse (if they were not removed when the corpse was placed on the ground), and at this point [...] is recited by the enactors of the ritual, as it refers to the removal of filthy clothes. Following this, the body is thoroughly rubbed with [...] water, with the mouth of the corpse covered so that water does not enter it; the next part of the ritual is the pouring of water over the head, while [...] is quoted, since it refers to the sprinkling of water to produce cleanness; and then each limb is washed downwards, while [...] and the following verses, which describe the beauty of elements of the body, are spoken. Finally, nine measures of cold water are poured over the body while it is upright, which is the core element of the ceremony, and it is then dried (according to some customs), and enshrouded; in ancient times the hair and nails were also cut, but by the 19th century the hair was merely combed, and the nails were just cleansed with a special pin, unless their length is excessive. After the ceremony, the taharah board is washed and dried, but is kept facing the same way, as there is a superstition with the belief that turning it the other way will cause another person to die within 3 days. Many communities have replaced the pouring of nine measures by immersion in a specially constructed mikveh.|$|E
