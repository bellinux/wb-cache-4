These heat flow spikes/pulses are integrated with respect to time, giving the total heat exchanged per injection. The pattern of these heat effects {{as a function of the}} molar ratio ligand/macromolecule can then be analysed to give the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction under study. It should be noted that degassing samples is often necessary in order to obtain good measurements as the presence of gas bubbles within the sample cell will lead to abnormal data plots in the recorded results. The entire experiment takes place under computer control.|$|E

The determination of attenuation constant should be enough to determine pressure and temperature profile of the well of interest. However, as reservoir pressure profile and flowrate are linked heavily to viscosity, this problem has to be solved in trial and error method, mostly due to the handling of viscosity change as a function of temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{and control of}} self-ignition hazards in stored granular materials require accurate values of their thermal properties, and the transient hot-wire method {{can be used for}} the determination of the thermal conductivity. Starting from the usual model of Carslaw and Jaeger, improvements in the interpretation model for the experimental data produced in the conventional hot-wire device are presented, taking into account the contact resistance between the wire and the powder, as well as the finite dimensions of the cylindrical medium, and enabling the time domain for the interpretation of experimental data to be estimated. In addition, the deviation from the linear plot of <b>temperature</b> <b>against</b> logarithmic <b>time</b> was shown to be due to the temperature dependence of the heat power. The interpretation method was successfully applied to the determination of the thermal conductivity of four powders depending on the temperature; in particular, the results obtained with glass particle packed bed were compared with published data...|$|R

40|$|From a <b>temperature</b> <b>against</b> <b>time</b> curve {{measured}} when {{a chemical}} reaction {{occurs in a}} batch reactor immersed in a constant temperature environment, {{it is possible to}} calculate both the rate constant and the enthalpy of a single reaction. This technique has been applied to the iron(III) –tin(II) redox reaction in chloride solution, studied over a twenty-fold variation in non-complexed chloride concentration and over a 50 K temperature range. Over this range of conditions the pseudo-second order rate constant for the reaction varied by a thousand-fold. Heats of reaction were also calculated. The experimental results obtained at 298 K agree with those of Duke and Pinkerton and support the finding that the rate-determining step involves chloro-complexes of the stannous and ferric ions. However, results at different temperatures indicate that rate-determining electron transfer occurs in precursor complexes of the tin(II), iron(III) and chloride ions rather than between iron(III) and tin(II) chloride complexes as suggested by Duke and Pinkerton. There is a common precursor complex for a given number of chloride ions. Furthermore, the enthalpies of activation of the electron transfer reaction in the precursor complexes are all the same and the different rate constants for electron transfer in each precursor complex is determined by the charge on the precursor complex...|$|E

Thermal comfort {{as well as the}} quantity of current expected in buildings is of paramount importance. Core materials used in erecting buildings were considered during this study. This study is meant to analyze the thermal and electrical properties of laterite, clay and sand samples thereby picking out the most suitable for inhabited buildings. Each sample of laterite, sand and clay was placed in the sample chamber of Lee’s disc apparatus and sufficient heat was passed to the samples through the conical chamber. The in and out temperatures of the specimens were determined. The cooling curves of <b>temperature</b> <b>against</b> <b>time</b> were employed to determine their thermal conductivities while the resistivity was obtained through the thermocouple and multi-meter. A very low thermal conductivity of 3. 5 x 101 kgms- 2 Ɵ- 1 and high resistivity of 0. 0337 Ωm were obtained for laterite samples. The results obtained revealed that the samples considered have different thermal conductivities, electrical resistivity and rates of cooling. The rate of cooling of laterite sample showed that it has low temperature fluctuations when it absorbs heat. The salt content of laterite sample in Ota was observed to be very minimal due to small quantity of current flowing through buildings constructed with such laterite sample analyzed.

40|$|A {{transient}} short-hot-wire {{technique has}} been proposed to measure the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of liquids simultaneously. To confirm its applicability and accuracy, are used the sample liquids with well-known their thermophysical properties. In the present method, through comparing with the numerical results obtained under the same aspect ratios and boundary conditions of the experiment, the thermal conductivity can be determined from the gradient of the <b>temperature</b> rise <b>against</b> <b>time,</b> and the thermal diffusivity {{can be obtained from}} the gradient and the absolute temperature rise. In the present paper, three kinds of liquids are measured, and it is found that the thermal conductivity and diffusivity can be obtained within errors of 2 % and 5 %, respectively. Because of the simplicity and small size of the probe, it is easy to coat an electrically insulating layer and only small amount of sample liquid is required. Therefore, this method is particularly suitable for an electrically conducting liquids and valuable or expensive liquids...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Making {{stacking}} gels for polyacrylamide gels in {{the laboratory}} by conventional methods is laborious and time consuming. Considering the role of temperature in polyacrylamide gels with respect to electrical resistance and viscosity, we assumed that decreasing the temperature would cause an increase in electrical resistance and viscosity. Ultimately, a downward temperature gradient imposed {{in the first phase}} of polyacrylamide gel running time would supposedly improve the migration of macromolecules. This project analyzed the effect of temperature gradient on the migration of macromolecules in the continuous gels (without stacking) and compared it with results obtained using stacking gels. Material and Methods: Electrical resistance was calculated using Ohm’s law. Subsequently, to examine the effect of temperature change on macromolecules separation, conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used as a model and specimens were run under three different conditions, one of which was prepared with a stacking gel. Results: The electrical resistance showed an inverse relationship with temperature in this study. Separation of the DNA molecules in the continuous gels (with no stacking) was comparable with the conventional method (with stacking). Conclusion: Using a <b>temperature</b> gradient <b>against</b> <b>time</b> may be an alternative method for stacking gels...|$|R
40|$|In tropospheric layer, {{radio waves}} can {{propagate}} {{in a number}} of different physical mechanisms such as free-space propagation or line-of-sight propagation, reflection, transmission, diffraction, scattering and wave guiding. The constituents in weather such as the wind, air temperature and atmospheric water content may combine in many ways. Certain combinations can cause radio signals to be heard hundreds of miles beyond the ordinary range of radio communications. This study investigates the effect of weather (temperature) on radio wave propagation up to 9 GHz. Continuous-wave (CW) envelope fading waveforms were recorded over a period of the one-hour using patch antenna. The observations were conducted at KUSZA Observatory, East Coast Environmental Research Institute (ESERI), UniSZA which is situated in Merang, Terengganu. Spectrum Analyser was used for RFI measurement and weather station for weather effect. The graphs of radio signal attenuation for weather parameter (<b>temperature)</b> <b>against</b> <b>time</b> were plotted.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the rates of cooling of vehicle brake drums and discs. Thermocouples were inserted in the drums and discs and in the wheel hubs and their outputs fed via slip ring units to meters mounted inside the vehicle. The drums or discs were heated to a uniform temperature of 30 O 0 - 40 OcC by drag braking and the rate at which they cooled measured while the vehicle was driven at constant speed. Measure-ments were made at various speeds in the range 0 to 90 mile/h. From the log (<b>temperature)</b> <b>against</b> <b>time</b> plot a cooling coefficient b, was determined. It is shown that at a vehicle speed v the quantity b, can be expressed in the form b, = bo +KVO. ~ where b, represents the loss of heat to the hub and K is a constant depending on {{the size and shape of}} the drum or disc. Values of these constants have been determined on a variety of cars having discs and drums varying from 7 in to 11 in diameter and on a lorry fitted with 16. 75 in diameter drums. Cooling rates are shown to depend on shape and size of the disc or drum. Results show that the cooling rates of front brakes are about 20 per cent higher than the rear brakes and that front discs cool about 25 per cent more quickly than the corresponding drum size recom-mended for the same vehicle. The cooling rate of front discs did not change when wire wheels were fitted instead of solid wheels. Ventilated discs and solid discs were also compared. The effect of fitting dust shields on disc brakes is shown to reduce the cooling rates by about 30 per cent. The effect of otherwise disturbing the air flow was studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsteady}} free {{convective flow}} about a horizontal circular cylinder {{in the presence}} of heat generation and radiation is considered in this thesis. The cylinder is fixed and immersed in a Newtonian fluid, while the temperature at the surface is either heated uniformly or oscillated harmonically about the mean temperature, temperature of the surrounding. In this study, the governing equations are first transformed into a non-dimensional form by using appropriate non-dimensional variables. These equations are then transformed into a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, then were solved numerically by using two types of finite difference methods namely explicit finite difference method and implicit finite difference scheme of Crank Nicolson method. The solutions obtained by those two methods are used to compare the accuracy between them with the previous studies. The presence of heat generation significantly gives effect which increased the local skin-friction coefficient, temperature and velocity distribution but the local rate of heat transfer decreases. While, the presence of radiation increase the local rate of heat transfer, skin-friction coefficient, the temperature and velocity distributions. On the other hand, as the Prandtl number increases, the temperature and velocity distributions are decreases. This study also presents the temperature patterns for the problems when the temperature of the surface is heated and oscillated with respect to time. The comparison between the presence of radiation, heat generation and both of radiation and heat generation on <b>temperature</b> profiles <b>against</b> <b>time</b> are presented.

30|$|A {{transient}} short hot-wire {{method was}} used to measure the thermal conductivities of the base fluids (k 0) and the nanofluids (k). The detailed measurement principle, procedure, and error analysis have been described in [37]. In our measurements, a platinum wire with a diameter of 50 μm was used for the hot wire, and it served both as a heating unit and as an electrical resistance thermometer. The platinum wire was coated with an insulation layer of 7 -μm thickness. Initially the platinum wire immersed in media was kept at equilibrium with the surroundings. When a regulation voltage was supplied to initiate the measurement, the electrical resistance of the wire changed proportionally with the rise in temperature. The thermal conductivity was calculated from the slope of the rise in the wire's <b>temperature</b> <b>against</b> the logarithmic <b>time</b> interval. The uncertainty of this measurement is estimated to be within ± 1.0 %. A temperature-controlled bath {{was used to}} maintain different temperatures of the nanofluids. Instead of monitoring the temperature of the bath, a thermocouple was positioned inside the sample to monitor the temperature on the spot. When the temperature of the sample reached a steady value, the authors waited for further 20 min {{to make sure that the}} initial state is at equilibrium. At every tested temperature, measurements were made three times and the average values were taken as the final results. A 20 -min interval was needed between two successive measurements. After the above-mentioned careful check on the measurement condition and procedure, the authors could gain confidence on the experimental results.|$|R
