The parting shot showed Madonna running {{around the room and}} posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, and some of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> quite lovely, their plaits of long hair falling from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought {{he looked like a}} fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

[...] "I wrote the book for Willow and for her friends and for all <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> {{in the world who}} need affirmation about being female in this pretty much masculine world.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, {{when asked about the}} lyrics [...] "Keep her coming every night" [...] and [...] "Sinking my fingertips into every inch of you", Levine said: [...] "Yep, that's sexual, all right. I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> would enjoy them, and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect." [...] He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word [...] "coming" [...] edited out of the line [...] "keep her coming every night". Levine noted, [...] "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like communist China. It's totally bizarre." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in the development, the {{backdrop}} of Rapture had been fleshed out, but they had yet to come on how to represent the drones, protectors, and harvesters from their original game idea. The Big Daddy concept as the protector class was developed early in the process, but the team had yet to reach a satisfying design for the drones, having used several possible designs including bugs and dogs in wheelchairs. The team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create pathos for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of Night Trap. However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including Ayn Rand, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell, and considered their ideas [...] "fascinating". He brought in the ideas of Objectivism that Rand primarily outlined in the book Atlas Shrugged, that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan’s work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings. This was extended to the use of <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit. 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game [...] "where the player gets punished for doing the right thing". They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this [...] "a massive kludge" [...] into the game's fiction. The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets. Levine desired only to have one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters [...] "much more ambiguous", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters. Levine also noted that [...] "it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} old adage [...] "Once {{there was a little}} girl..." [...] you come across a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> and her parents, all wearing crowns. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> is wide awake {{claiming}} she is not tired. Her parents take this almost as a regular occurrence and require that she at least put on her pajamas, wash her face, brush her teeth. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> keeps repeating that she is not tired but climbs into bed and under the sheets since that is where she is the most comfortable. She then proceeds to ask her parents if everything thing goes to sleep. The parents then proceed to go through a list of animals and their habits of sleeping. They discuss the family dog, the cat, bats, snails, bears, and whales. <b>The</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> proclaims that she knows an animal that sleeps a lot. We then finally come across the tiger in the jungle, where <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> tells her parents that he sleeps to stay strong. The parents agree that sleep is good to stay strong then say good night even thought <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> claims she is still not sleepy. Her parents know what will happen and agree that she can stay awake all night long. After the long discussion, <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> goes through all the processes that the animals go through and ends up fast asleep.|$|R

2500|$|The song [...] "I'll Do It" [...] was {{described}} as Montag getting [...] "racy" [...] due to the song's sexually explicit lyrics stating to [...] "come eat my panties off of me." [...] Montag addressed the issue by stating [...] "I love it. I'm a very sexual person and I'm married, so it's okay. I think every woman ... has an alter ego. We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'm still kind of in charge here.' The lyrics are definitely a little edgy - and I'm sorry to <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> - but I am married. Eat the panties off when you're married." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 9-1-1 {{call from}} the farm where Zook and her mother sought help was {{recorded}} at 10:36a.m. An article, Revisiting the Amish Schoolhouse Massacre, described the situation prior {{to the arrival of}} the first state police troopers: [...] "An Amish adult male from this farm, with his two large dogs, took the bold opportunity to stealthily approach the windowless back wall of the schoolhouse. Hoping for an opportunity to help <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls,</b> he slowly crept around one side of the wooden structure and positioned himself as an observer next to a side window." [...] The detailed accounting of the police response continues, [...] "Observing that the first police patrol vehicle to approach the scene was not slowing down to stop, the Amish man quickly withdrew from his hiding place and sprinted towards the roadway to wave down the trooper, who did a fast U-turn and parked. That would be the last successful attempt at an unnoticed move upon the building by anyone." ...|$|E

The latter song was cut partly because the staging required <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>girls</b> to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long. [...] "Mama's Talkin' Soft" [...] was later recorded by Petula Clark and released as a single in the UK in 1959. Other cut songs include [...] "Mother's Day", a song for Baby June's act, [...] "Smile, Girls", which involves Rose trying to teach the untalented girls to smile {{in order to make the}} act look good, [...] "Who Needs Him?", which Rose sings to herself after Herbie leaves her, and [...] "Three Wishes for Christmas", a burlesque number similar to one that would be performed at Minsky's Burlesque.|$|E
