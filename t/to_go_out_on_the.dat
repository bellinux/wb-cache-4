5|$|Meanwhile, NBC {{has hired}} {{recently}} laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is invited <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town with them, but finds {{that he is}} incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn {{that he no longer}} lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street.|$|E
500|$|Ed O'Brien {{described}} the lyrics, saying [...] "They were universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human." [...] The song [...] "Bodysnatchers" [...] {{is inspired by}} Victorian ghost stories, the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke's feeling of [...] "your physical consciousness trapped {{without being able to}} connect fully with anything else." [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> weekend in Oxford. Yorke said [...] "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first stop}} after Olympia for [...] "The Old Oregon Trail Monument Expedition" [...] was Tenino, Washington, where Meeker went ahead by train on February 20, 1906 to make {{arrangements}} for the first monument of the trip. [...] He still had no driver, and had his wagon pulled to Tenino by horses, with the oxen trailing behind. [...] He appealed to a local quarry for a suitable stone, which was carved and was dedicated in Tenino at a ceremony on the 21st. He had less success as he journeyed south towards Portland; at none of the remaining Washington stops was a monument erected, and although Meeker placed wooden posts where monuments should go, most of the designated towns did not follow through. [...] The lack of enthusiasm about Meeker's mission continued in Portland, where the Unitarian church elders voted against allowing Meeker {{the use of the}} building to give a fundraising lecture, pledging to do nothing to [...] "encourage that old man <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Plains to die".|$|E

2500|$|On 9 October, the {{government}} cancelled {{the meeting with}} student leaders that had been scheduled for 10 October. Carrie Lam explained {{at a news conference}} that [...] "We cannot accept the linking of illegal activities to whether or not to talk." [...] Alex Chow said [...] "I feel like {{the government}} is saying that if there are fewer people on the streets, they can cancel the meeting. Students urge people {{who took part in the}} civil disobedience <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets again to occupy." [...] Pan-democrat legislators threatened to veto non-essential funding applications, potentially disrupting government operations, in support of the suffragists.|$|E
2500|$|A {{paragraph}} in the Zohar starts: [...] "One {{must prepare}} a comfortable seat with several cushions and embroidered covers, {{from all that}} {{is found in the}} house, like one who prepares a canopy for a bride. For the Shabbat is a queen and a bride. This is why the masters of the Mishna used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eve of Shabbat to receive her on the road, and used to say: Come, O bride, come, O bride!' And one must sing and rejoice at the table in her honor ... one must receive the Lady with many lighted candles, many enjoyments, beautiful clothes, and a house embellished with many fine appointments ..." ...|$|E
