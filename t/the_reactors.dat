5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved in the design of <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His insistence that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|Reactors {{that use}} lithium-7 heat water under high {{pressure}} and transfer heat through heat exchangers that {{are prone to}} corrosion. <b>The</b> <b>reactors</b> use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of boric acid, which {{is added to the}} water to absorb excess neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Hanford Site.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> {{containment}} {{pressure boundary}} relates to <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> containment system. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> containment system design must include the functional capa-bility of enclosing <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> system and {{of providing a}} final barrier against the release of radioactive fission products attendant postulated accidents.

5000|$|On July 13, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> {{experienced}} {{a series of}} temperature and radiation fluctuations (known as [...] "excursions", because they were an unexpected departure from expected conditions). The power level rose from about 4 MW to about 14 MW (70 percent of full power) {{over a period of}} about two minutes. The excursion required the operators to manually override a malfunctioning automatic-control switch, and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was shut down. The switch was repaired, and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was slowly restarted. The following day, monitors again indicated elevated airborne radioactivity levels within <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building. <b>The</b> source was traced to two locations at <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> core loading face, which were sealed; airborne radioactivity within <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building was reduced. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> was restarted, but the operators noted unusual behavior over the next few days. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> increased power faster than expected, and the temperature difference between <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> bottom (where <b>the</b> sodium entered) and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> top (where <b>the</b> sodium exited) was unusually high. Radioactivity within <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> also increased. <b>The</b> operators investigated, performing several exercises to understand and correct <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> behavior.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Neutron {{measurements}} {{were made in}} <b>the</b> pulsed <b>reactor</b> building and on the safety screen of <b>the</b> pulsed <b>reactor</b> {{in order to determine}} the neutron yield of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> as a function of (1) distance from <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> centerline, (2) direction in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building, and (3) position on <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> safety screen...|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E
5|$|If the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of uranium was poorly understood, that of plutonium was practically unknown, {{as it had}} only existed in microscopic amounts. Samples began arriving from <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> in 1943, and although the locus of the Manhattan Project's investigations into plutonium chemistry was at the Metallurgical Laboratory, the Ames Project investigated methods of separating plutonium metal from uranium and fission products.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload <b>the</b> <b>reactors,</b> the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E
40|$|A {{test was}} made to {{determine}} radiation levels in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pit and canal walkways with <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pit filled to various levels. Temperatures at several locations {{on the floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pit while <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was at power were also measured. Draining all shielding water from the pit while <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was at approximately 39 % of full power did not result in a radiation hazard on the canal walkways. When <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pit was completely drained the highest radiation levels were found above the outside edge of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> dome approximately 25 ft from the pit floor. The temperature of selected bolts and the surrounding concrete at the base of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> dome did not increase when all the water was removed from <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pit. (W. L.

25|$|In contrast, BWRs have no boron in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> coolant {{and control}} <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> power by {{adjusting}} <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> coolant flow rate.|$|R
50|$|If {{the water}} level inside <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> {{pressure}} vessel drops to a predetermined level, due {{to the loss of}} water inventory, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> is depressurized and the GDCS is initiated. It consists of large pools of water inside containment located above <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> that are connected to <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel. When the GDCS system is initiated, gravity forces water to flow from the pools into <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> <b>The</b> pools are sized to provide sufficient amounts of water to maintain the water at a level above the top of the nuclear fuel. After <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> has been depressurized, the decay heat is transferred to the containment as water inside <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> boils and exits <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel into the containment in the form of steam.|$|R
5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group that {{included}} Creutz, Leo Ohlinger, Alvin M. Weinberg, Katharine Way and Gale Young. The group's {{task was to}} design <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite neutron moderator and water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time because water was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor; but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolant would delay the project. Working seven days a week, the group designed <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> between September 1942 and January 1943. Creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water-cooled system, and designed the cooling system. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> to DuPont. Wheeler {{became part of the}} DuPont design staff. He worked closely with its engineers, commuting between Chicago and Wilmington, Delaware, where DuPont had its headquarters. He moved his family to Wilmington in March 1943. DuPont's task was not just to build nuclear reactors, but an entire plutonium production complex at the Hanford Site in Washington. As work progressed, Wheeler relocated his family again in July 1944, this time to Richland, Washington, where he worked in the scientific buildings known as the 300 area.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory {{turned its}} {{attention}} back to theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much of the complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
40|$|An all-transistor {{system has}} been {{developed}} {{to be used in}} measuring the reactivity of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> in <b>the</b> Sandia Engineering <b>Reactor</b> Facility. In operation, the system triggers a pulsed neutron source (PNS) in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> and counts <b>the</b> resulting neutron flux, thus giving a measure of the time constant of <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> <b>The</b> counting is done in eleven time-sequenced counting channels. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> time constant is a measure of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> reactivity...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was restarted, {{radiation}} monitors inside <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building {{showed a}} {{sharp increase in}} airborne radioactivity within <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> remained operating, while attempts were made to determine where the radioactivity was coming from. Airborne radioactivity then returned to normal.|$|R
50|$|Reflectors were {{arranged}} {{around the outside}} of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> to provide <b>the</b> means to control <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> <b>The</b> reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were {{held in place by}} a retaining band anchored by an explosive bolt. When the reflector was ejected from <b>the</b> unit, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> permanently shut down.|$|R
5|$|Bacher {{and fellow}} {{commissioner}} Sumner Pike {{began with an}} inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted an inventory of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> at Hanford. These problems {{were on their way}} to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission's representative. Bacher's original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President Harry Truman convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, and this time the President was unable to dissuade him.|$|E
5|$|Investigating the conspiracy, Rorschach and Dreiberg {{discover}} that Veidt is behind everything. Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops {{off at the}} publication office of the New Frontiersman, a right-wing tabloid. Rorschach and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt admits to being responsible for Blake's murder, Manhattan's exile, Rorschach's framing, and his own assassination attempt, which he staged to divert suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the United States and the Soviet Union by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors infused with energy from Manhattan. Rorschach and Dreiberg attempt to stop him, but Veidt subdues them both and reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> have been detonated, and the energy signatures are recognized as Manhattan's.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> for {{plutonium}} production involved several problems, {{not just in}} nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
50|$|In events where <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> coolant {{pressure}} boundary remains intact, the Isolation Condenser System (ICS) {{is used to}} remove decay heat from <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> and transfer it outside containment. The ICS system is a closed loop system that connects <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel to a heat exchanger located in the upper elevation of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> building. Steam leaves <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> through <b>the</b> ICS piping and travels to the ICS heat exchangers which are submerged in a large pool. The steam is condensed in the heat exchangers and the denser condensate then flows back down to <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> to complete <b>the</b> cooling loop. <b>Reactor</b> coolant is cycled through this flow path to provide continuous cooling and to add water to <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> core.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> light-water <b>reactor</b> {{also uses}} {{ordinary}} water to keep <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> cooled. <b>The</b> cooling source, light water, is circulated past <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> core {{to absorb the}} heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separate from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like <b>the</b> pressurized-water <b>reactor.</b> But in some <b>reactors</b> <b>the</b> water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> core, for example <b>the</b> boiling-water <b>reactor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{reactors}} siphon {{water into}} the input of <b>the</b> <b>reactor's</b> re-circulation pump. A potential complication is the medium in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> becoming compacted, increasing back pressure onto the pump and reducing water into <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> Placing a gate or needle valve on <b>the</b> <b>reactor's</b> outlet side will improve flow characteristics compared to control from the inlet side.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reactors</b> {{were used}} to {{undertake}} research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
5|$|After the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project, it gave {{responsibility}} for the detailed design and construction of <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> to DuPont. There was friction between the company and Wigner and his team. Major differences between Wigner's reactor design and DuPont's included {{increasing the number of}} process tubes from 1,500 in a circular array to 2,004 in a square array, and cutting the power from 500 MW to 250 MW. As it turned out, the design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional tubes came in handy when neutron poisoning became a problem for the B Reactor at the Hanford Site. The extra tubes allowed a greater fuel load to overcome the poisoning. Without them the reactor would have had to be run at low power until enough of the boron impurities in the graphite had been burned up to allow it to reach full power, which would have delayed full operation by up to a year.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> {{were shut}} down between 1964 and 1971, with an average {{individual}} life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E
50|$|Design Equations are {{equations}} {{relating the}} space {{time to the}} fractional conversion and other properties of <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> Different design equations have been derived for different types of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> and depending on <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> <b>the</b> equation more or less resemble that describing the average residence time. Often design equations are used to minimize <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> volume or volumetric flow rate required to operate a reactor.|$|R
30|$|Initially <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was washed, {{cleaned and}} dried completely. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> was then charged with 100  g of CVD graphene/water nano-fluid. Then, a {{sufficient}} amount {{of natural gas}} was injected into <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> so that <b>the</b> air trapped inside <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> completely evacuated. After that, the relief valve was closed and natural gas was injected into it until the pressure of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> reached 1000  psig. Reactor temperature was slightly reduced by setting the temperature of cooling system at 4  °C.|$|R
30|$|Isothermal {{conditions}} in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> were maintained by circulating hot {{water from a}} thermostatted water bath (Tamson T- 1000) through the jacket of <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> <b>The</b> temperature of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> contents was measured {{by means of a}} K-type thermocouple. The pressure in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was determined with a Druck PDCR 910 pressure transducer. The pressure and temperature transducers were connected to a Squirrel SQ 1000 series Data Logger and Mercer Premium computer, enabling data collection and programmed reactor operation. A desired mass flow rate of pure SO 2 from the cylinder to <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was controlled using a mass flow meter (Brooks 5150 T). The gas leaving <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was passed through a caustic scrubber before discharging it to the atmosphere. A pressure regulator was employed to control gas pressure in <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> (Tescom series 1700 back pressure regulator).|$|R
5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with <b>the</b> <b>reactors.</b> However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in <b>the</b> <b>reactors</b> 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E
5|$|Wigner was {{disappointed}} that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of <b>the</b> <b>reactors,</b> not just their construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it {{by the head of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem. Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year. During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site. Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.|$|E
50|$|It {{took four}} years for <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> to be repaired, and then {{performance}} was poor. In 1972, <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> core was dismantled and <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> was decommissioned. America's first effort at operating a full-scale breeder had failed.|$|R
25|$|During the Three Mile Island accident, slow partial {{meltdown}} of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> core occurred. About 19,000kg {{of material}} melted and relocated in about 2 minutes, approximately 224 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> scram. A pool of corium formed {{at the bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> vessel, but <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> vessel was not breached. The layer of solidified corium ranged in thickness from 5 to 45cm.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> is {{fabricated}} {{to house}} the ceramic foam blocks coated with catalyst of a particular dimension (42  mm ×  42  mm ×  15  mm). <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> {{is made up of}} stainless steel and having a square cross-sectional area. It has the dimension 42  mm ×  42  mm ×  200  mm. At the preliminary stage of the catalyst loading process, a wire mesh of 40  mm ×  40  mm ×  1  mm dimension was placed exactly beneath <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> to support <b>the</b> catalyst bed. Catalyst-coated SiC foam is placed at the middle of <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> Inert ceramic beads were packed {{on both sides of the}} catalyst foam within <b>the</b> <b>reactor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reactor,</b> along with <b>the</b> thermocouple properly inserted up to the middle of it, was then fixed with the whole set-up by suitably attaching it with the preheater and the product outlet tube. The maximum allowable temperature of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> is 450  °C. The outlet of <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> is connected with a condenser. The reaction vapor was cooled with the water–ethylene glycol mixture (60 : 40 v/v) circulated by chiller (Fig.  1) through <b>the</b> condenser. <b>The</b> <b>reactor</b> is kept in an insulated metal jacket with glass wool insulation to minimize the heat loss from <b>the</b> <b>reactor</b> during heating and reaction.|$|R
