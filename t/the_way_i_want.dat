In 1973 Premier's marketing manager, Eddie Haynes, began consulting with Moon about specific requirements. At one point, Moon asked Premier to make a white kit with gold-plated fittings. When Haynes said that it would be prohibitively expensive, Moon replied: [...] "Dear boy, do exactly as you feel it should be, but that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it." [...] The kit was eventually fitted with copper fittings and later given to a young Zak Starkey.|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{inspired}} by the look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. [...] "I Know It", a track from Madonna's self-titled debut album, appeared as the B-side. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the [...] "Express Yourself" [...] single release.|$|E

After the film's release, Rowe said [...] "Some people come up and say, 'Hey, you made the big time'; I've made the big time, but not in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it." [...] Cindy Streit, Borat's etiquette consultant, subsequently hired high-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who demanded that the California Attorney General investigate fraud allegedly committed by Baron Cohen and the film's producers.|$|E

500|$|Diamandis {{released}} 11 {{music videos}} through YouTube during the promotional campaign for Electra Heart. She claimed that their production led her record label into bankruptcy, but {{stated that they}} would be released and [...] "finish this era <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to." [...] The first, titled [...] "Part 1: Fear and Loathing", was released on 8 August 2011, and sees Diamandis cutting her long brown hair and singing the track on a balcony during the nighttime. It was followed by [...] "Part 2: Radioactive" [...] on 22 August, which depicts a blonde-wigged Diamandis travelling across the United States with her romantic interest. The track was released through the iTunes Store on 23 September, and peaked at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart on 15 October. The black-and-white clip [...] "Part 3: The Archetypes" [...] shows the close-up of a blonde Diamandis while the introduction of [...] "The State of Dreaming" [...] is played; it introduced the archetypes [...] "housewife", [...] "beauty queen", [...] "homewrecker", and [...] "idle teen" [...] on 15 December.

500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, by <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1969, Clancy {{got married}} and went on a honeymoon trip around the world, swimming, surfing and [...] "getting some sun." [...] He said, however, {{marriage}} had not reduced his desire to play football. [...] "Just the opposite", he said. [...] "I'm more hungry than ever. [...] I {{want to make that}} money." [...] After a season on crutches, the UPI reported: [...] "The former rookie wonder wants to get back under quarterback Bob Griese's passes, to reclaim his billing as the Miami Dolphins' top receiver. [...] Despite a scar on his knee, Clancy was dashing, cutting and jumping for passes during summer workouts. [...] However, even Clancy acknowledged the injury had slowed him down: [...] "I'm still a couple of steps slower than before the operation. [...] But I'm optimistic. [...] It doesn't pain me. [...] I figure I have a month to work <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to, I'll be all right." [...] Clancy's comeback appeared to be on track in early November, as he was a close second among Miami receivers with 21 catches for 289 yards. [...] However, the comeback was cut short on November 2, 1969, when he suffered torn ligaments, this time to his right knee in a loss to the New York Jets. [...] Clancy missed the final six games of the 1969 season due to the injury.|$|E

500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
500|$|Under the pen name Robert Jordan, James Oliver Rigney, Jr. {{began writing}} the {{intended}} final book, A Memory of Light, before {{the release of}} the previous book Knife of Dreams in 2005. Scheduled for publication by Tor Books in 2009, it was intended to conclude the series, which began in 1990 with The Eye of the World, originally intended as a series of four or five books. According to Forbes, Jordan had intended for it to be the final book [...] "even if it reaches 2,000 pages." [...] After Jordan fell fatally ill in December 2005 from a rare disease, cardiac amyloidosis, he still intended to finish at least A Memory of Light, and thus the main story arc, if the [...] "worse comes to worst." [...] Later he made preparations in case {{he was not able to}} finish the book. [...] "I'm getting out notes, so if the worst actually happens, someone could finish A Memory of Light and have it end <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to end."

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
