40|$|The {{appearance}} of a <b>new</b> <b>programming</b> language gives <b>the</b> necessity to contrast its contribution with the existing programming languages to evaluate the novelties and improvements that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>programming</b> language offers for developers. These kind of studies can show us the efficiency, improvements and useful or uselessness of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>programming</b> languages. Also these studies can show us the good or bad properties of the existing programming languages. For these reasons, these studies allow us to know if <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>programming</b> language is offering improvements or relapses. In this article, we compare <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>programming</b> language of Apple, Swift, with the main programming language of Apple before Swift, Objective-C.
