25|$|A law {{to improve}} the system of {{sickness}} benefits provided that those insured would receive compensation when obliged {{to stay at home}} <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sick child and thereby incurring a loss of income. An insured person could request unpaid leave of absence on such occasions. The same law established the right to a home help, to be paid for by the health service, where the parents are in hospital or undergoing treatment, provided that the household included a child under 8 or a handicapped child required special care. The SPD-FDP coalition’s time in office also saw a considerable expansion in the number of childcare places for three- to six-year-old children, with the number of facilities rising from 17,493 in 1970 to 23,938 in 1980, and the number of places from 1,160,700 to 1,392,500 during that same period. Subsidies for day care rose between 1970 and 1980, but fell between 1980 and 1983.|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 151 - 161. There is {{substantial}} evidence {{to indicate that}} South Africa is facing {{the prospect of a}} large number of children, now and in the future, who will be orphaned as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In all likelihood, these children would have experienced psychological trauma through the illness and death of people close to them, and the social isolation that accompanies HIV-infection and AIDS-related illness and death. The ideal would be for as many of these children as possible to experience some type of family life in which to grow and mature into responsible adults. The aim of the present study was to explore a range of factors that might influence prospective carers' decisions <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. These include features of prospective carers; features of the orphaned child; and forms of assistance that may be required. By means of a postal survey, the present study explored existing adoptive and foster parents' (N= 17 S) willingness <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> HIV/AIDS orphan. Results show that close to 69 % of respondents indicated <b>a</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> HIV/AIDS orphan. Although some differences were noted depending on the HIV status of the child and whether the respondent was an adoptive or foster parent, on the whole they also indicated <b>a</b> preferred willingness <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> HIV-negative female child, up to the age of 6 years old, of the same culture and from the same family as themselves, and without surviving relatives or siblings. Free medical <b>care</b> and schooling <b>for</b> the child were the suggested forms of assistance required. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991), explored in the present study, did predict intentions <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> either <b>an</b> HIV-negative or HIV-positive orphan. However, certain components of the models did not have good predictive ability calling into question the usefulness of the model as a means to explain and predict intention <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> HIV/AIDS orphan. Implications of the study provide recommendations for persons involved with children orphaned by HIV/AIDS...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are legal}} ramifications as well. Infertility {{has begun to}} gain more {{exposure}} to legal domains.

5000|$|Since failure <b>to</b> provide proper <b>care</b> <b>for</b> {{animals is}} <b>an</b> act of {{omission}} or neglect rather than an affirmative act, the failure <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> animal is considered a misdemeanor offense in most states. [...] For instance, in Alaska, if an animal owner fails to provide the aforementioned standards of care, the state has prima facie evidence of <b>a</b> failure <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> animal. If the prosecutor can prove the owner’s failure <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> animal was done with criminal negligence and the failure <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the animal caused its death or severe physical pain or prolonged suffering, then the owner may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. In Colorado, failure to provide an animal with the proper standard of care is a Class 1 misdemeanor. In Virginia, each owner must provide for each of his companion animals: adequate feed; adequate water; adequate shelter that is properly cleaned; adequate space in the primary enclosure for the particular type of animal depending upon its age, size, species, and weight; adequate exercise; adequate care, treatment, and transportation; and veterinary <b>care</b> when needed <b>to</b> prevent suffering or disease transmission. Violation of these standards is a Class 4 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation {{may result in a}} higher grade misdemeanor. Likewise, under Virginia's animal cruelty statute, any person who deprives any animal of necessary food, drink, shelter or emergency veterinary treatment is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.|$|R
2500|$|Pets {{and animals}} also had social and {{cultural}} implications throughout the nineteenth century. The categorization of dogs by their breeds reflected the hierarchical, social order of the Victorian era. The pedigree of a dog represented the high status and lineage of their owners and reinforced social stratification. [...] Middle-class owners, however, valued the ability to associate with the upper-class through ownership of their pets. The ability <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pet signified respectability and the capability to be self-sufficient. [...] According to Harriet Ritvo, the identification of “elite animal and elite owner was not a confirmation of the owner’s status but a way of redefining it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1984 brought The Little Drummer Girl, Keaton's first {{excursion}} {{into the}} thriller and action genre. The Little Drummer Girl {{was both a}} financial and critical failure, with critics claiming that Keaton was miscast for the genre, such as one review from The New Republic claiming that [...] "the title role, the pivotal role, is played by Diane Keaton, and around her the picture collapses in tatters. She is so feeble, so inappropriate." [...] However, that same year she received positive reviews for her performance in Mrs. Soffel, a film based on {{the true story of}} a repressed prison warden's wife who {{falls in love with a}} convicted murderer and arranges for his escape. Two years later she starred with Jessica Lange and Sissy Spacek in Crimes of the Heart, adapted from Beth Henley's Pulitzer Prize-winning play into a moderately successful screen comedy. In 1987, she starred in Baby Boom, her first of four collaborations with writer-producer Nancy Meyers. In Baby Boom, Keaton starred as a Manhattan career woman who is suddenly forced <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> toddler. That same year she made a cameo in Allen's film Radio Days as a nightclub singer. 1988's The Good Mother was a misstep for Keaton. The film was a financial disappointment (according to Keaton, the film was [...] "a Big Failure. Like, BIG failure"), and some critics panned her performance, such as one review from The Washington Post: [...] "her acting degenerates into hype– as if she's trying to sell an idea she can't fully believe in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Poverty affects {{individual}} {{access to}} quality education. The U.S. education system is often funded by local communities; therefore {{the quality of}} materials and teachers can reflect the affluence of community. That said, many communities address this by supplementing these areas with funds from other districts. Low income communities are often not able to afford the quality education that high income communities do. Poor perceptions, by teachers, of families and communities in poverty can manifest itself in teachers who will not put forth the effort to teach and students who {{are thought to be}} opposed to learning; in both cases poor students are thought to be incapable. When a teacher assumes a child is linguistically deficient, they may look through a stigmatized lens when working with the student. This can create an atmosphere that can reify negative stereotypes and undermine student motivation. By the teacher not looking through such a lens, {{they will be able to}} reinforce the idea that all their students have an opportunity to increase their learning abilities, which can result in more classroom engagement and student motivation. Females in poverty are also likely to become pregnant at a young age, and with fewer resources <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child, young women often drop out of school. [...] A reason for the gap in access to education is due to the fact that reforms in the instruction programs have not been implemented well or at all in high poverty schools. Due to these and other reasons the quality of education between the classes is not equal.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1970, the {{government}} drew up an Action Programme for the Promotion of the Rehabilitation of Handicapped Persons. During that same year, bills were tabled to extend and increase housing allowances (passed in 1970), to extend and standardise {{the promotion of}} vocational training (passed in 1971), to automatically index pensions for war victims (passed in 1970), to increase family allowances (passed in 1970), and to reform “shop rules” (which came into force in 1972). In 1974, a bankruptcy allowance was introduced for employed persons when their employers became insolvent. Developments in accident insurance led to the inclusion of schoolchildren, students and children at kindergarten and thus to more widespread measures for accident prevention. In addition, farm and household assistance was introduced as a new service in agricultural accident insurance. A major pension reform law extended the accessibility of pension insurance by providing generous possibilities for backpayments of contributions, while adjustment of currently paid out pensions was brought forward by 6 months. The Rehabilitation and Assimilation Law of 1974 improved and standardised benefits for the disabled, while a law was passed that same year on {{the establishment of an}} additional relief fund for persons employed in agriculture and forestry. The Law on the Improvement of Works’ Old Age Schemes of 1974 brought conditional non-forfeiture of qualifying periods for works pensions as well as the prohibition of cuts in works pensions due to increases in social insurance pensions. In addition, a number of reforms in areas such as civil and consumer rights the environment, education, and urban renewal were carried out. in 1972, a pension reform act was passed which, according to one historical study, ensured that workers “would not suffer financial hardship and could maintain an adequate standard of living after retirement.” In 1973, sickness benefits became available in cases where a parent had <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sick child.
