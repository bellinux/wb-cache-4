5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The moon is also designated UranusI.|$|E
5|$|Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell, it {{is named}} for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope's <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock and Shakespeare's The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 18th century, between 1716 and 1719, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, author of <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock, lived in Chiswick – in the {{building}} which is now the Mawson Arms {{at the corner of}} Mawson Lane. Another 18th-century resident was the actor Charles Holland, who was born in Chiswick in 1733.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rapes</b> may {{be grouped}} in regions, most {{commonly}} two geographic divisions within Sussex. <b>The</b> <b>Rapes</b> <b>of</b> Arundel, Bramber and Chichester comprised Sussex's western division; <b>the</b> <b>Rapes</b> <b>of</b> Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey comprised Sussex's eastern division. These divisions {{formed the basis of}} the areas administered by East and West Sussex County Councils and the non-metropolitan counties of East Sussex and West Sussex that were created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.|$|R
50|$|The Local Government Act 1888 {{introduced}} administrative counties each {{governed by}} an elected county council. Sussex {{was divided into}} two administrative counties: With {{the exception of the}} county boroughs of Brighton, Hastings and from 1911, Eastbourne, East Sussex County Council administered <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings, while West Sussex County Council administered <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Chichester, Arundel and Bramber. Each county council was required to adopt a common seal.|$|R
50|$|The Local Government Act 1888 {{created the}} {{administrative}} county of West Sussex, {{with its own}} county council, from <b>the</b> three western <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient county of Sussex, that is <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Chichester, Arundel and Bramber. With {{the exception of the}} three county boroughs of Brighton, Hastings and Eastbourne, <b>the</b> three eastern <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings came under the control of East Sussex County Council. Until 1898 it existed alongside the Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts, when these were abolished in favour of a new network or urban and rural districts.|$|R
5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
5|$|Martial also {{suggests}} <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a woman by a bull in a {{re-creation of the}} myth of Pasiphaë. Nero had provided a similar entertainment at an event he had staged using an actor dressed in the costume of a bull, though Martial claims that the act performed at the inaugural games was authentic.|$|E
5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out because he had a 31-count {{indictment}} for <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and never would have been on the street.|$|E
50|$|In April 2002, {{authorities}} in Indian-administered Kashmir arrested three Indian paramilitary soldiers following <b>the</b> gang <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> 17-year-old girl. In July 2011, there were anti-India protests in Srinagar against <b>the</b> alleged <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a 25-year-old village {{woman in the}} village of Manzgam.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Io, Europa, and Medea, which {{motivated}} Paris to abduct Helen. The subsequent Trojan War {{is marked}} as {{a precursor to}} later conflicts between peoples of Asia and Europe. ( [...] - 5) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> changed. Changes to <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> {{allowed for}} <b>the</b> {{possibility of a}} male being <b>the</b> victim <b>of</b> <b>rape.</b> <b>The</b> revised definition considered rape to include forced sexual contact in terms of vaginal, anal, or oral sex.|$|R
5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion {{that result from}} uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E
5|$|In the novel's final chapters, {{the three}} storylines {{intersect}} with increasing frequency. The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture {{and death of}} the assassins {{at the hands of}} the SIM, the failure of the coup, <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> Urania, and the concessions made to Trujillo's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country. The book ends as Urania prepares to return home, determined this time to keep in touch with her family back on the island.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} renowned works he ordered was the raising of the Sigismund's Column in Warsaw. The column, {{dedicated}} to his father, was designed by the Italian-born architect Constantino Tencalla and the sculptor Clemente Molli, and cast by Daniel Tym. He was less interested in decorative architecture; he supported the construction of two palaces in Warsaw – Kazanowski Palace and Villa Regia. Among other works sponsored by or dedicated to him is Guido Reni's <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Europa.|$|E
50|$|Administering such an {{extensive}} county as Sussex {{as a single}} unit had proved difficult: the traditional meeting of the court of quarter sessions at Chichester in the south-west was a long distance from much of the county's population and no single venue met the needs of such a diverse county. A statute of 1504 created a system where the sheriff's court alternated between Chichester and Lewes. By the 1590s every administrative arrangement within local control respected the subdivision of the county into an eastern division, made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Hastings, Lewes and Pevensey, and a western division, made up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Arundel, Bramber and Chichester.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Soviet {{women by}} Wehrmacht soldiers, with numbers ranging between {{hundreds}} of thousands and ten million according to different estimates, is not treated by the authors as something deserving serious mention.|$|R
50|$|In Kent {{the areas}} of the regiones survived as the lathes into which the later county was subdivided. <b>The</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Sussex, which {{similarly}} each included several hundreds, may also reflect the regiones that made up the earlier Kingdom.|$|R
5|$|The sons of vanquished foes {{would be}} enslaved and often {{forced to work}} in male brothels, {{as in the case}} of Phaedo of Elis, who at the request of Socrates was bought and freed from such an {{enterprise}} by the philosopher's rich friends. On the other hand, it is attested in sources that <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> slaves was prosecuted, at least occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Uranus has 27 named moons, five {{of which}} are massive enough to have {{achieved}} hydrostatic equilibrium. There are another 13 inner moons that orbit within Uranus's ring system, and another nine outer irregular moons. Unlike most planetary moons, which are named from antiquity, all the moons of Uranus are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's work <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} Scandal, Kurosawa {{was approached}} by Daiei studios, which asked the director to make another film for them. Kurosawa picked a script by an aspiring young screenwriter, Shinobu Hashimoto, with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films. Their first joint effort was based on Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's experimental short story In a Grove, which recounts {{the murder of a}} samurai and <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> his wife from various different and conflicting points-of-view. Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.|$|E

50|$|During Indonesia's conflict-ridden {{period of}} 2003-2009, Chandrakirana chaired the National Commission on Violence Against Women, which {{documented}} critical violations of women's human rights, including in Aceh, Papua, Poso (Central Sulawesi), {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> May 1998 and the killings of 1965.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god {{of the sky and}} air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the Belgian civilian population along their route of advance. These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against the German army. Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by the German army between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable sympathy for the Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The sympathy for the plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. <b>The</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, Sussex {{has had its}} own dialect with {{regional}} differences reflecting its cultural history. It has been divided into variants for <b>the</b> three western <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> West Sussex, <b>the</b> two eastern <b>rapes</b> <b>of</b> Lewes and Pevensey and an area approximate to <b>the</b> easternmost <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> Hastings. [...] <b>The</b> Sussex dialect is also notable in having an unusually large number of words for mud, in a way similar to the popular belief which exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for snow.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with several}} other {{counties}} (Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and Yorkshire) Sussex was for administrative purposes divided into an eastern division and a western division. An informal arrangement for several centuries, the division of Sussex for administrative purposes was formally confirmed through the County of Sussex Act 1865. In 1889 county councils were created for the eastern and western divisions and county boroughs were created {{as part of the}} Local Government Act 1888. <b>The</b> <b>Rapes</b> <b>of</b> Arundel, Bramber and Chichester comprised Sussex's western division and <b>the</b> <b>Rapes</b> <b>of</b> Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings comprised the eastern division, with the exclusion of the large towns of Brighton and Hastings which became county boroughs. Sussex continued to be classed as a single county under the act and retained a single lieutenancy and shrievalty.|$|R
50|$|Increased {{attention}} {{in the media and}} awareness among both Indians and the outside world is both bringing attention to <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>rape</b> in India and helping empower women to report the crime. After international news reported <b>the</b> gang <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a 23-year-old student on a moving bus that occurred in Delhi, in December 2012, Delhi experienced a significant increase in reported <b>rapes.</b> <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> reported <b>rapes</b> nearly doubled from 143 reported in January-March 2012 to 359 during the three months after <b>the</b> <b>rape.</b> After <b>the</b> Delhi <b>rape</b> case, Indian media has committed to report each and every rape case.|$|R
5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Ferrier {{made her}} stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera <b>The</b> <b>Rape</b> <b>of</b> Lucretia. A year later {{she made her}} first {{appearance}} as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and her many visits to continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|In both Feuchtwanger's {{novel and}} Harlan's film, the {{dramatic}} climax is rape. However, Feuchtwanger posits that Süß has a hidden daughter whom the duke discovers, rapes and who then dies by drowning. The novel then focuses on Süß's {{grappling with the}} desire for revenge and the tragedy resulting from his decision to exact vengeance {{for the loss of}} his daughter. Harlan replaced <b>the</b> <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> Süß's daughter by the duke with Süß's rape of an Aryan woman, thus completely inverting Feuchtwanger's plot device from a father's tragic quest for vengeance to the punishment of a Jew for having sexual relations with a Christian.|$|E
50|$|Arigatō is {{the story}} of a young girl whose family was divided by <b>the</b> <b>raping</b> <b>of</b> her and her sister, which was carried out by a serial rapist who terrorizes women all over Japan. But then, her father, who was away for 6 months returns and starts to repair his {{destroyed}} family.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{systematic}} <b>rape</b> <b>of</b> {{women in}} <b>the</b> DRC {{is regarded as}} a tool of oppression focused on a specific ethnic group and is generalized through terror that is justified through established national discourses. During times <b>of</b> war, mass <b>rape</b> can be seen as an effective way to “feminize” one’s enemy by violating “his women, nation and homeland,” thus proving that he is incapable of being an adequate protector. <b>The</b> <b>raping</b> <b>of</b> women in this process seeks to destroy the very “fabric of society, as women are seen as the symbolic bearers of ethno-national identity because of their roles as biological, cultural, and social reproducers of society itself”.|$|R
