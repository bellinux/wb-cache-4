In contrast {{to the way the}} end of the war was still perceived by a majority of people in Germany at the time, he defined 8 May as a [...] "day of liberation". Weizsäcker pointed out the inseparable link between the Nazi takeover of Germany and the tragedies caused by the Second World War. In a passage of striking boldness, he took issue with one of the most cherished defenses of older Germans.

Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying. Woodrow Myers from the Los Angeles Times was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: [...] "Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far <b>too</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> stop: We don't ask why the Department of Defense and the entitlements like Social Security are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the multiple sclerosis patients are not." [...] The Gay Community News in Boston also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent. Richard Rouilard, editor of The Advocate in 1992 criticized Shilts for being {{out of touch with}} the contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones.|$|E

The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including typhoons, nervous breakdowns, the firing of Harvey Keitel, Martin Sheen's heart attack, extras from the Philippine military {{and half of the}} supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels and an unprepared Brando with a bloated appearance (which Coppola attempted to hide by shooting him in the shadows). It was delayed so often it was nicknamed Apocalypse When? The 1991 documentary film , directed by Eleanor Coppola (Francis's wife), Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper, chronicles the difficulties the crew went through making Apocalypse Now and features behind-the-scenes footage filmed by Eleanor.

40|$|An ideal {{state of}} development, when viewed with fantasy, {{is nothing but}} a state or {{condition}} where light touches everybody without refraction. The diagonal line of the Lorenz Curve Framework represents such an ideal condition. In the presence of inequality, however, it deviates or refracts from the ideal condition. In this paper, I try to measure economic inequality from the index of refraction. First, I compute such an index for each stratum to evaluate condition in each and then add all to propose an overall measure of economic inequality, which appears to be a standardised measure of the length of the Lorenz Curve relative to that of the diagonal line.

40|$|Index of {{refraction}} {{is found}} to be a good measure of economic inequality within the Lorenz curve framework. It has origin in geometrical optics, where it measures bending of a ray of light passing from one transparent medium into another. As light refracts according to characteristics of different media, so also Lorenz curve does according to concentration of wealth or income in different strata. In line with this analogy, first I compute refractive index for each stratum under the Lorenz curve framework to evaluate condition in each and then simply add all to propose an overall measure for the whole framework. The latter appears to be pro transfer-sensitive and equivalent to the measures based on length of the Lorenz curve. Also, it is related to transfer-neutral Gini coefficient by quadratic equation. The applicability of the approach is tested utilising data on distribution of income or consumption from the WDI 2014. Results are lively and remarkable. While an index value of less than 1. 00 represents an 2 ̆ 018 anomalous refraction' in optics, such a condition of inequality appears to be <b>too</b> common for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in reality. In contrast to that, in some countries, the refractive index of the richest group exceeds that of Diamond (2. 42), where an index value of 1. 00 depicts an ideal condition that is enviable. Although the preliminary exercise is done with grouped data, it can be extended vividly to the case when the Lorenz curve is continuous.

40|$|This article {{talks about}} how {{advances}} in human language technology can help overcome some of the barriers that prevent community participation in cyberspace. Human language technology refers to the set of technologies, such as speech recognition and speech synthesis {{that are used to}} create spoken language systems [...] -systems that allow people to communicate with machines using speech. A significant advantage of using speech as an interface modality is that it can be transmitted by existing communications networks using common and inexpensive devices such as telephones and televisions. Today, use of the internet is limited to people with access to computers and the skills to use them. These requirements exclude a great many Americans: computers are <b>too</b> expensive for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to own, and about one third of our citizens are functionally illiterate (National Center for Education Statistics, 1993). In the future, computers are unlikely to be the major appliance for accessing the National Information Infrastructure; Telephones, cellular phones, televisions connected to cable networks and inexpensive information applicances are likely to become the preferred means of access. To be sure, speech technology cannot by itself satisfy all needs. For instance, many people are unable to speak and/or hear. Some kinds of information, such as images, are not in a form that can be readily conveyed using speech. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} in the United States speak and understand a language, and speech is an obvious means for them to access information. As spoken language technologies mature, we can imagine spoken language systems performing as cooperative agents, not unlike helpful human operators, to support a wide variety of transactions. 2 Center for Spoken Language Un [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sex made {{me and it}} {{probably}} made you <b>too,</b> but for <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> sex remains a mystery for our entire lives. I see sexual images every day, but I rarely hear it discussed openly or factually. This is problematic. If most people are having sex and most people {{have a lot of}} misinformation about it, STDs, unwanted pregnancies and even sexual assaults are much more likely. Research suggests that increased (and well developed) sex ed. can reduce all of the possible negative outcomes of sexual misinformation. My observations of everyday life and my research in academia have given me a strong background in sex positivity and have given me the drive {{to do something about this}} country’s appalling approach to sex education. This book is an attempt to synthesize my understanding of sex through an exploration of feminist, anthropological, scientific and artistic material on the vast and complicated subject of human reproduction. I set out with the purpose of creating an illustrated handbook for “having the talk. ” Naturally, the artistic and research process drove my project to evolve into an illustrated story that explains the process of sex and some of the implications for poor sex education. By analyzing a variety of books and article on the topics of evolution, sex positivity and health I created a concise compilation of the topics I find to be most important when it comes to understanding sex. The purpose of this book is to provide education and inspiration for the reader. The goal is to de-stigmatize the topic of sex through access to knowledge as well as inspire the reader to begin to discuss the topic of sex (especially with their partners and/or children). While the project is research based, it also served as a tool for self-evolution and education. Ultimately, this book exists as a personal account of why talking about sex really matters...|$|R

There must have been 15 or 20 fighters. Of course they gang up on a cripple, you know, polish that one off with no trouble, but he disappeared into a cloud bank and we never saw him again.
