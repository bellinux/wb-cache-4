5|$|The Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the roles of}} gender and visual realism in <b>the</b> persuasiveness of <b>speakers.</b> Participants <b>were</b> presented with a persuasive passage delivered by a male or female person, virtual human, or virtual character. They were then assessed on attitude change and their ratings of the argument, message, and <b>speaker.</b> <b>The</b> results indicated that <b>the</b> virtual <b>speakers</b> <b>were</b> as effective at changing attitudes as real people. Male participants were more persuaded when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> female than when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> male, whereas female participants were more persuaded when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> male than when <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>was</b> female. Cross gender interactions occurred across all conditions, suggesting {{that some of the}} gender stereotypes that occur with people may carry over to interaction with virtual characters. Ratings of the perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>were</b> more favorable for virtual speakers than for human <b>speakers.</b> We discuss <b>the</b> application of these findings in the design of persuasive human computer interfaces...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>is</b> Liberal Peter Milliken. Milliken was re-elected as the Speaker of the House for the 39th Parliament on April 3, 2006. The Speaker only {{votes in}} a tie, and, as Milliken is a Liberal, the Liberal caucus was {{effectively}} reduced by one. This, {{along with the}} defection of Wajid Khan to the Conservatives enabled the Conservatives to pass legislation {{with the cooperation of}} any one of the three opposition parties: Liberals, Bloc Québécois, or New Democratic Party (NDP).|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense <b>the</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>is</b> attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>speaker</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} its inventor, Donald Leslie, who began {{working in the}} late 1930s to get a speaker for a Hammond organ that better {{emulated}} a pipe or theatre organ, and discovered that rotating the speaker gave the best sound effect. Hammond {{was not interested in}} marketing or selling the speakers, so Leslie sold them himself as an add-on, targeting other organs as well as Hammond. Leslie made the first speaker in 1941. The sound of the organ being played through his speakers received national radio exposure across the US, and it became a commercial and critical success. It soon became an essential tool for most jazz organists. In 1965, Leslie sold his business to CBS who, in 1980, sold it to Hammond. Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation subsequently acquired the Hammond and Leslie brands.|$|E
