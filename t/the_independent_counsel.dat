5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel,</b> Lawrence E. Walsh, {{chose not}} to re-try North or Poindexter. In total, several dozen people were {{investigated}} by Walsh's office.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Independent Counsel/Walsh {{investigation}} produced four interim {{reports to}} Congress. Its final report was published as the Final Report of <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> for Iran/Contra Matters. Walsh's records {{are available at}} the National Archives.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel's</b> {{report has}} been a source of {{partisan}} bickering because it was heavily redacted with an estimated 120 pages removed by court order.|$|R
5000|$|Julie Lyn Myers Wood (born 1969) was the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She {{assumed the}} job {{following}} a recess appointment by President George W. Bush on January 4, 2006. Previously, Myers worked for <b>the</b> Office of <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> under Kenneth Starr {{and was a}} lead prosecutor in <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel's</b> failed case against Susan McDougal.

5000|$|Neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary {{were ever}} prosecuted, after three {{separate}} inquiries found insufficient evidence linking {{them with the}} criminal conduct of others related to the land deal. The matter was handled by <b>the</b> Whitewater <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel,</b> Kenneth Starr. <b>The</b> last of these inquiries came from <b>the</b> final <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel,</b> Robert Ray, (who replaced Starr) in 2000. [...] Susan McDougal was granted a pardon by President Clinton before he left office.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified extensively about helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Whitewater" [...] is {{sometimes}} used to include other controversies from the Bill Clinton administration, especially Travelgate, Filegate, {{and the circumstances}} surrounding Vince Foster's death, that were also investigated by <b>the</b> Whitewater <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tripp was a {{resident}} of Columbia, Maryland, {{at the time she}} made her surreptitious recordings of the conversations with Lewinsky, and 49 Democrats in the Maryland Legislature signed a letter to the state prosecutor demanding that Tripp be prosecuted under Maryland's wiretap law. Before the trial, the state court ruled that because of the immunity agreements which <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel's</b> office entered into with Tripp, Lewinsky, and others, a substantial amount of the evidence which the prosecution intended to use was inadmissible.|$|R
5000|$|The prosecutor, who was {{appointed}} by a special panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, could investigate allegations of any misconduct, with an unlimited budget and no deadline, and could be dismissed only by the Attorney General for [...] "good cause" [...] or by the special panel of the court when <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel's</b> task was completed. As the president could not dismiss those investigating the executive branch {{it was felt that}} the independence of the office would ensure impartiality of any reports presented to Congress. However, there have been many critics of this law including Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Many argued <b>the</b> new <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel's</b> office was a sort of [...] "fourth branch" [...] of government that had virtually unlimited powers and was answerable to no one. However, the constitutionality of the new office was ultimately upheld in the 1988 Supreme Court case Morrison v. Olson.|$|R
25|$|The {{contents}} of the documents produced by Hubbell provided <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> with the information {{that led to the}} second prosecution.|$|E
25|$|This case {{involved}} the second prosecution of Webster Hubbell by <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel.</b> The prosecution {{arose from the}} Independent Counsel's attempt to determine whether Hubbell had violated a promise (part of a plea agreement) to cooperate in the Whitewater investigation. In October 1996, while Hubbell was in jail {{as a result of}} the conviction on the guilty plea in the Whitewater case, <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> served him with a subpoena duces tecum calling for the production of eleven categories of documents before a grand jury.|$|E
25|$|In the end, <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> {{brought more}} than 50 {{criminal}} convictions {{related to the}} failed S, including cases against Clinton’s successor as Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker, and his business partners in Whitewater.|$|E

5000|$|The name {{derives from}} the case of San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society, Inc., which the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District decided on December 3, 1984. While Cumis is the best-known appellate {{precedent}} {{on the issue of}} <b>the</b> appointment of <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> for <b>the</b> defense of insureds when their insurance company has a conflict of interest, Cumis was not the first proponent of this principle. The Supreme Court of California approved <b>the</b> concept of <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> in an earlier 1964 case, which in turn was based upon a 1925 Kentucky case that laid the foundation for appointing <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> in <b>the</b> insurer-insured relationship. [...] Cumis innovated beyond existing precedent as of 1984 by holding that the insurer was required to pay for <b>the</b> insured's <b>independent</b> <b>counsel,</b> and that a merely theoretical conflict of interest could be ripened by the insurer's act of sending a reservation of rights letter into an actual conflict of interest, which in turn meant that the insured now had a right to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bates was a {{law clerk}} for Judge Roszel C. Thomsen of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland from 1976 to 1977 and was an {{associate}} at Steptoe & Johnson from 1977 to 1980. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1980 to 1987, and was Chief of the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office from 1987 to 1997. Bates was on detail as Deputy <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> for <b>the</b> Whitewater investigation from 1995 to mid-1997. In 1998, he joined the Washington, D.C. law firm of Miller & Chevalier, where he was Chair of the Government Contracts/Litigation Department {{and a member of}} the Executive Committee. From September 1995 until leaving in March 1997, Bates worked as Deputy <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> for Kenneth Starr and <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel's</b> office during <b>the</b> investigation into President Bill Clinton.|$|R
25|$|Clinton and Lewinsky {{were both}} called {{before a grand}} jury; Clinton testified via closed-circuit television, Lewinsky in person. She was granted {{transactional}} immunity by the United States Office of <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel,</b> in exchange for her testimony.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after months}} of {{interviews}} with Lavalle, Fannie Mae executives, and a review of Fannie Mae's securitization, foreclosure, and legal practices and procedures, <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel,</b> Mark Cymrot issued Report to Fannie Mae Regarding Shareholder Complaints By Nye Lavalle, OCJ Case No. 5595.|$|E
25|$|Gates {{consistently}} {{testified that}} he first heard on October 1, 1986, from Charles E. Allen, the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the Contras. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received {{a report on the}} diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr. The issue was whether <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October.|$|E
50|$|Further {{investigations}} by the FBI and the Department of Justice, the White House itself, the General Accounting Office, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, and <b>the</b> Whitewater <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> {{all took}} place over the subsequent years.

25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that Bill Clinton had with Monica Lewinsky. After several years of investigation, Starr filed the Starr Report, which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E
500|$|In {{the legal}} aftermath, Swidler & Berlin v. United States became an {{important}} Supreme Court decision. [...] The length, expense, and results of the Travelgate and the other investigations grouped under the Whitewater umbrella turned {{much of the public}} against <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> mechanism. [...] As such, <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> law expired in 1999, with critics saying it cost too much with too few results; even Kenneth Starr favored the law's demise.|$|E
500|$|An FBI {{document}} {{suggested that}} Livingstone {{had been given}} his position because First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton {{was a friend of}} Livingstone's mother and recommended him. [...] Hillary Clinton stated that while she was once photographed with the mother in a large group, she did not know her. Hillary Clinton was briefly deposed at the White House by <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> regarding this matter on January 14, 1998. [...] (That same day, the same Office of <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> staff were listening to taped conversations of Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky; the Lewinsky scandal was soon to break.) [...] In 1999, Clinton gave a sworn statement that she {{had nothing to do with}} Livingstone's hiring. Livingstone also stated under oath there was no truth to the supposed hiring relationship. Hillary Clinton would later refer to the whole files matter as a [...] "pseudoscandal".|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> City {{retained}} <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> {{to carry}} out the investigation. As of the date of his resignation this investigation ceased as it is now moot due to his not being Mayor any longer.|$|R
25|$|<b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> {{made this}} {{decision}} subject to developments {{that could have}} warranted reopening his inquiry, including testimony by Clair E. George, the CIA's former deputy director for operations. At <b>the</b> time <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> reached this decision, the possibility remained that George could have provided information warranting reconsideration of Gates' status in the investigation. George refused to cooperate with <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> and was indicted on September 19, 1991. George subpoenaed Gates to testify as a defense witness at George's first trial {{in the summer of}} 1994, but Gates was never called.|$|R
25|$|Following the District Attorney’s Office, Wolfson {{served as}} Associate Counsel to Lawrence Walsh in <b>the</b> Office of <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> (Iran/Contra). In 1992, {{he served on}} the New York State Task Force on Sexual Harassment.|$|R
500|$|In August 1994, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{took over}} from Fiske in {{investigating}} Whitewater, Foster, and indirectly {{the travel office}} matter. [...] On July 22, 1995, Hillary Clinton gave a deposition under oath to <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> that touched on travel office questions; she denied having {{had a role in}} the firings, but was unable to recall many specifics of conversations with Foster and Watkins.|$|E
500|$|It was Scalia's {{view that}} clear lines of {{separation}} among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches follow {{directly from the}} Constitution, with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch. In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful—and solitary—dissent in 1988's Morrison v. Olson, in which the Court's majority upheld <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> law. Scalia's thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice Harry Blackmun for its emotional content; Blackmun felt [...] "it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming". Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the executive branch by the legislative. He warned, [...] "Frequently an issue of this sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing... But this wolf comes as a wolf".|$|E
500|$|Ray's full 243-page {{report was}} {{unsealed}} and made public on October 18, 2000, {{three weeks before}} the Senatorial election. [...] It confirmed that neither Hillary Clinton nor David Watkins would be indicted. [...] It included some new detail, including a somewhat unsubstantiated claim from a friend of Watkins saying that the First Lady had told Watkins to [...] "fire the sons of bitches." [...] Ray cited eight separate conversations between the First Lady and senior staff and concluded: [...] "Mrs. Clinton’s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in the Travel Office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees." [...] Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given [...] "factually false" [...] testimony when questioned by the GAO, <b>the</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel,</b> and Congress about the travel office firings, but reiterated that [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] that she knew her statements were false or understood that they may have prompted the firings.|$|E
