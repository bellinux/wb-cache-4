One day Locke picks up a young hitchhiker, named Eddie Colburn (Justin Chatwin), who tells him he is leaving home. Eddie joins the commune, but after six weeks, he asks Locke why he is never allowed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on in a greenhouse (into which he sees an exceptional amount of fertilizer going).

500|$|On {{the morning}} of May25, in spite of bad weather, a crowd {{gathered}} in the Plaza de la Victoria, as did the militia led by Domingo French and Antonio Beruti. They demanded the recall of the Junta elected the previous day, the final resignation of Cisneros, and {{the appointment of a}} new junta that did not include him. Historian Bartolomé Mitre stated that French and Beruti distributed blue and white ribbons, similar to the modern cockade of Argentina, among those present. Later historians doubt it, but consider it possible that the revolutionaries used distinctive marks of some kind for identification. It was rumored that the Cabildo might reject Cisneros' resignation. Because of delays in issuing an official resolution, the crowd became agitated, clamoring that [...] "the people want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on!".|$|E
500|$|Under James Elverson, The Philadelphia Inquirer declared, [...] "the new Inquirer {{shall be}} {{in all respects}} a complete, enterprising, {{progressive}} newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit {{of the time and}} behind in nothing of interest to people who want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going on every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions..." [...] During the 1900 Republican convention in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared [...] "Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World." [...] At the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted Schuylkill Canal for drinking water. The newspaper continued similar politics under Elverson Jr., and by the 1920s The Inquirer became known as the [...] "Republican Bible of Pennsylvania".|$|E
500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not like what they like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players would not be able <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E

2500|$|This clause {{is highly}} controversial.
