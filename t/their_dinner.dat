5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so to feed <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. <b>Their</b> <b>dinner</b> of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the couple that once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued {{the idea of}} eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E
5|$|Bond visits Ascot Racecourse {{to observe}} the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, {{believes}} that Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes after being chased by Bond.|$|E
5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E

60|$|There is {{only one}} single other thing to do. And it's more {{difficult}} than poison-gas. It is to leave off loving. It is to leave off benevolenting {{and having a good}} will. It is to cease utterly. Just leave off. Oh, parents, see that your children get <b>their</b> <b>dinners</b> and clean sheets, but don't love them. Don't love them one single grain, and don't let anybody else love them. Give them <b>their</b> <b>dinners</b> and leave them alone. You've already loved them to perdition. Now leave them alone, to find their own way out.|$|R

5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours to the business of farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{prepare to}} sit down for <b>their</b> <b>dinner,</b> baby Stewie is shown {{watching}} television, with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade taking place on the screen. Stewie notices a hot air balloon in the parade resembling himself. After the family decides {{to go to the}} Griffin family's backyard to play football, Joe approaches his son to encourage him to beat the other team. Joe then references the 2009 war film The Hurt Locker, with Kevin responding with disdain for the film, despite supposedly being in a coma during its release. Joe also goes on to point out that Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an off the wall reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what cutaway to play on the screen. They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E
25|$|Councilwoman Ruth Yitanes (Lee Garlington) {{tells the}} detectives that Gwen {{canceled}} <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> plans {{on the night}} of Rosie's murder. When asked if the Richmond campaign has links to a Michael Ames' company, Yitanes says the company donates to Mayor Adams.|$|E

60|$|The company's {{call was}} sounded, and, {{surprised}} at a summons {{just as they}} were cooking <b>their</b> <b>dinners,</b> the troops fell in, in front of their quarters, and the officers took their places in front of them, and waited for orders.|$|R
25|$|In cities {{during the}} Great Leap, {{there was an}} {{emphasis}} on collective use of public space even for activities that had usually {{taken place in the}} home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> in public dining halls. Ultimately, the Great Leap Forward proved disastrous, failing to industrialize effectively and causing famine due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing people to move back to farms.|$|E
25|$|The three flee to Cadiz, Spain with Cunegonde's jewels, {{where the}} Old Lady tells Candide and Cunegonde about her past. The jewels are stolen and the Old Lady offers to sing for <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> ("I Am Easily Assimilated"). The French police arrive, {{intending}} to arrest Candide for murdering Don Issachar and the Archbishop. Accepting {{an offer to}} fight for the Jesuits in South America, Candide decides to take Cunegonde and the Old Lady to the New World, and the three begin their journey on a ship ("Quartet Finale").|$|E
25|$|One day {{she leaves}} {{a gift for}} Charles, a nude {{photograph}} that she took of him asleep in the laboratory after lovemaking, and he begins to shun her. When a fellow scientist visits he claims sole credit for the technique she discovered. Angered by his rebuff and betrayal, Mary at first takes it out on Henry, but then decides to leave the island and return to London. On her way out, conspicuously dressed as a Jew once more, she presents to Mrs. Cavendish at <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> table the picture of her naked husband.|$|E

25|$|Children {{from the}} lower end of the social {{hierarchy}} are predicted to choose “heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap” in <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> layouts, opting for “plentiful and good” meals as opposed to foods that are “original and exotic.” These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu’s “ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy,” that contrasts the “convivial indulgence” characteristic of the lower classes. Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the social classes.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two long}} morning classes {{with a short}} break in between them for {{students}} {{to get to their}} next class. After lunch, classes resume at 1pm, and there is a break around afternoon teatime before another class period. The classes are about one hour in length, with occasional double periods lasting two hours. Classes end around five o'clock. First-year students get Friday afternoons off, while sixth- and seventh-year students have several free periods during the week. In the evening, students eat <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> in the Great Hall, after which they are expected to be in their common rooms. Astronomy classes take place late at night in the Astronomy Tower.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey {{had other}} {{considerations}} {{in the summer}} of 1970, which was Kent County Cricket Club's Centenary. Kent had been 13th in the County Championship in his first year as captain in 1957, but had improved and were runners up in 1967 and 1968. The county has been short of funds throughout the 60s, but agreed to increase resources for extra staff for the 1970 season, which could only be justified by winning the County Championship {{for the first time since}} 1913. Apart from their energetic overseas player Asif Iqbal and the Scottish Mike Denness they had home-grown talent in the shape of Alan Knott, Derek Underwood, Bob Woolmer, Brian Luckhurst, and Alan Ealham. At the start of the season Edward Heath, Kent fan and leader of the Conservative Party, gave a speech at <b>their</b> <b>dinner,</b> saying that 1906 had seen Kent win their first County Championship alongside a change of government and they should do so again in 1970.|$|E
60|$|The {{difference}} {{between him and}} the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they had had <b>their</b> <b>dinners.</b>|$|R

500|$|A {{few days}} after <b>their</b> <b>dinner,</b> Braxton telephoned Ross to confirm that she had finally signed the contract; {{this was the first}} time Ross learned that Rice had {{apparently}} promised Braxton that he would write an entirely new song for her to sing in the musical if she agreed to sign the paperwork. Panicked, Ross immediately contacted Rice, who confirmed that he had in fact agreed to write a song for Braxton, blaming himself for having consumed too much alcohol during <b>their</b> <b>dinner.</b> Rice asked Ross to allow him 24 hours to review the musical and see if there was in fact a moment for which he and Menken could develop a new song, and decided to write a ballad for the second act during which Belle tells Maurice how she has changed during her stay in the Beast's castle. [...] "A Change in Me" [...] was written four years into Beauty and the Beasts run.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{objections}} from his NEF colleagues, Renoir hired Gregor {{for the role}} of Christine. She was older than the original character and he made changes to the character based on Gregor's personality and on <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> conversations, such as making Christine the daughter of an Austrian conductor. Many of Renoir's friends believed {{he fell in love with}} Gregor shortly after casting her. Zwoboda said Gregor had [...] "that which Renoir loved above all; an incontestable class, a style, the gestures and bearing of a great distinction." [...] Renoir said he cast Gregor because of her Austrian accent, which he believed would create [...] "a little barrier... between her and her surroundings" [...] and because of her appearance, which he considered [...] "birdlike" [...] and [...] "sincere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Jan and Michael {{to have a}} romantic {{relationship}} was conceived by Steve Carell {{as far back as}} the filming of the pilot episode. The kiss between the two was rehearsed and filmed [...] "many, many, many times", according to B. J. Novak. While filming, Steve Carell and Tim Meadows improvised a good majority of <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> scene, but most of it never made the final cut. During the production of the episode, the cast and crew were informed by NBC that the show would be picked up for a whole 22 episodes, a move that [...] "surprised" [...] them. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics and earned a Nielsen rating of 3.8 in the 18–49 demographic, being viewed by 7.5 million viewers.|$|E

60|$|There was one {{for each}} couple, and after the ladies had sucked the juice they divided them and added their {{respective}} shares to <b>their</b> <b>dinners</b> and teas. Supper came next.

500|$|During <b>their</b> <b>dinner,</b> Avery tells Jack {{some day}} {{he will be}} as great as a man as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, to which Jack replies [...] "I do like jelly beans", a {{reference}} to Reagan's real-life love of the candy. During one scene of [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter", Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) [...] tells the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff [...] "I know you're all secretly mad, because we finally have a black Disney princess", which is {{a reference to the}} 2009 Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog in which the princess character, Tiana, is the first black princess in the Disney Princess franchise. In her speech, Liz says that she wants to be with a man who [...] "will just shut their mouth" [...] when watching the ABC show Lost.|$|E
500|$|While filming, Steve Carell and Tim Meadows improvised {{a lot of}} <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> scene, {{but most}} of it never made the final cut. One improvised scene that did make the final cut was the [...] "Baby Back Ribs" [...] song. In an interview, Jenna Fischer said that the rooftop scene was her {{favorite}} to shoot. Fischer recalled that [...] "there was a very small crew up on the roof and they had the cameras really far away." [...] After the main shooting ended, producers decided to do a re-shoot to explain the [...] "Dwigt" [...] situation clearly and concisely. The kiss between Michael and Jan was rehearsed and filmed [...] "many, many, many times", according to B. J. Novak. While editing the kiss between Michael and Jan, Greg Daniels brought many people into the editing room to see if they thought the kiss was too long or not long enough.|$|E
500|$|Ellenbrook Chapel, {{the first}} church in Worsley {{was built in}} 1209 by the Worsley family. [...] Methodism was first practised {{in the area in}} 1784, by the notable preacher Matthew Mayer. Later {{services}} were held in various locations around the area, and in 1801 a Methodist chapel was built along Barton Road. [...] The foundation stone for St Mark's Church was laid on 14 June 1844 by George Granville Francis Egerton, the son of Francis Egerton. Designed by the architect George Gilbert Scott, the church was consecrated on 2 July 1846 by the Bishop of Chester, John Bird Sumner. [...] The church tower is now home to the mechanism for the Bridgewater Clock from the Bridgewater workshops at Worsley Green. The clock strikes 13times at 1pm, originally so that workmen did not miss the end of <b>their</b> <b>dinner</b> break. [...] Many gravestones in the churchyard were cut from rock sourced at Worsley Delph. [...] Following a proposed hotel development in 1981 the area around the church and vicarage was designated a conservation area.|$|E

60|$|But Sally Kittridge, being lonely, found {{something}} in her heart which could only be comforted by visits to that grave.
