5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of yōkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form {{outside of}} an El Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, {{but it had}} one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> we can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, but <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> other actions should cease. Much {{attention is paid to}} tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E

However, <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the brain loses functionality; rather, it becomes more efficient due to increased myelination (insulation of axons) and the reduction of unused pathways.|$|E
25|$|Peak oil is the {{projection}} that future petroleum production (whether for individual oil wells, entire oil fields, whole countries, or worldwide production) will eventually peak and then decline {{at a similar}} rate to {{the rate of increase}} before the peak as these reserves are exhausted.

25|$|While {{atypical}} {{gender role}} development may be heritable, <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is {{more accepting of}} male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society’s negativity typically forces males to try {{to stay within the}} stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.|$|E
25|$|In general, logical {{consequence}} in first-order {{logic is}} only semidecidable: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then {{this can be}} discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, <b>this</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan is {{a largely}} rural society (almost {{two thirds of}} the {{population}} lives in rural areas) and women are rarely formally employed. <b>This</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> women do not participate in the economy: quite on the contrary, women usually work on the farm of the household, practice subsistence agriculture, or otherwise work within the household economic unit. However, women are often prevented from advancing economically, due to social restrictions on women's movement and gender mixing, as well as due to low education.|$|E
