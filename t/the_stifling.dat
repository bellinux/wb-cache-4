25|$|The lack of {{food and}} water took its toll on the young {{children}}, many of whom were forced to stand for long periods in the hot, tightly packed gym. Many children took off their clothing because of the sweltering heat within the gymnasium, which led to rumours of sexual impropriety, though the hostages later explained it was merely due to <b>the</b> <b>stifling</b> heat and being denied any water. Many children fainted, and parents feared they would die. Some hostages drank their own urine. Occasionally, the militants (many of whom took off their masks) took out some of the unconscious children and poured water on their heads before returning them to the sports hall. Later in the day, some adults also started to faint from fatigue and thirst. Because of the conditions in the gym, when the explosion and gun battle began on the third day, many of the surviving children were so fatigued that they were barely able to flee from the carnage.|$|E

Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait and come back later. The countess insisted {{that he must be}} received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, in addition to the description in her diary.|$|E
25|$|Wives of many Decembrists {{followed}} their husbands into exile. The expression Decembrist {{wife is a}} Russian symbol of the devotion of a wife to her husband. Maria Volkonskaya, {{the wife of the}} Decembrist leader Sergei Volkonsky, notably followed her husband to his exile in Irkutsk. Despite the spartan conditions of this banishment, Sergei Volkonsky and his wife, Maria, took opportunities to celebrate the liberalising mode of their exile. Sergei took to wearing an untrimmed beard (rejecting Peter the Great's reforms and salon fashion), wearing peasant dress and socialising with many of his peasant associates with whom he worked the land at his farm in Urik. Maria, equally, established schools, a foundling hospital and a theater for the local population. Sergei returned after thirty years of his exile had elapsed, though his titles and land remained under royal possession. Other exiles preferred to remain in Siberia after their sentences were served, preferring its relative freedom to <b>the</b> <b>stifling</b> intrigues of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and after years of exile there was not much for them to return to. Many Decembrists thrived in exile, in time becoming landowners and farmers. In later years, they would become idols of the populist movement of the 1860s and the 1870s, as the Decembrists' advocacy of reform (including the abolition of serfdom) won them many admirers, the writer Leo Tolstoy among them.|$|E

500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>stifling</b> {{experience}} of school, Gibbons found university exhilarating and made numerous friendships, particularly with Ida Graves, an aspiring poet who, although {{on a different}} course, attended {{some of the same}} lectures. The two shared a love of literature and a [...] taste [...] for subversive humour. Graves lived until 1999, and recalled in an interview late in life that many of the jokes they shared found their way into Cold Comfort Farm, as did some of their common acquaintances. Soon after Gibbons began the course she contributed a poem, [...] "The Marshes of My Soul", to the December 1921 issue of University College Magazine. This parody, in the newly fashionable vers libre style, was her first published literary work. During the next two years she contributed further poems and prose to the magazine, including [...] "The Doer, a Story in the Russian Manner", which foreshadows her later novels in both theme and style. Gibbons completed her course in the summer of 1923, and was awarded her diploma.|$|E
500|$|Psychiatric diagnoses {{such as the}} {{diagnosis}} of [...] "sluggish schizophrenia" [...] in political dissidents in the USSR were used for political purposes. It was {{the diagnosis}} of [...] "sluggish schizophrenia" [...] that was most prominently used in cases of dissidents. Sluggish schizophrenia as one of new diagnostic categories was created to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>stifling</b> of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted {{as a tool of}} oppression {{in the name of a}} political system. According to the Global Initiative on Psychiatry chief executive Robert van Voren, the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the conception that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally sick since there was no other logical rationale why one would oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world. The diagnosis [...] "sluggish schizophrenia," [...] a longstanding concept further developed by the Moscow School of Psychiatry and particularly by its chief Snezhnevsky, furnished a very handy framework for explaining this behavior.|$|E

500|$|Join Hands was {{different}} from The Scream; it was darker, more experimental, less abrasive, with a new [...] "claustrophobic" [...] mood. McKay's guitar-playing generates a [...] "barrage of sound" [...] while Severin's [...] "bass carries the tune". The recording took place under a strained atmosphere. McKay and Kenny Morris withdrew and became uncommunicative {{with the rest of}} the band and their manager and co-producer of the album, Nils Stevenson. Unlike the sessions for The Scream, the music was recorded without Siouxsie, as she added her vocals later. Morris did not take part in the mixing sessions, while Siouxsie was heavily involved. Commenting a few days before the album's release, Jon Savage wrote about the music: [...] "The songs are delivered with <b>the</b> <b>stifling</b> intensity of inner violence in a locked room". Kris Needs remarked that Join Hands was, in retrospect, an ironic title for a record which split the group in two. The album reflected how the band felt at the time: [...] "We were lonely and isolated and that comes across in the music", stated Siouxsie in 2003. She added: [...] "Musically, Join Hands was an uncompromising album but it still sounds modern today".|$|E

While Brezhnev, albeit [...] "sporadically", through Alexei Kosygin, attempted to reform the economy in the late 1960s and 1970s, he ultimately failed to produce any positive results. One of these reforms was the economic reform of 1965, initiated by Kosygin, though its origins are often traced back to the Khrushchev Era.
