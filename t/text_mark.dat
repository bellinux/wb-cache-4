40|$|XML {{has been}} widely adopted as an {{important}} data interchange language. The structure of XML enables sharing of data elements with variable degrees of nesting {{as long as the}} elements are grouped in a strict tree-like fashion. This requirement potentially restricts the usefulness of XML for marking up written text, which often includes features that do not properly nest within other features. We encountered this problem while marking up medical text with structured semantic information from a Natural Language Processor. Traditional approaches to this problem separate the structured information from the actual <b>text</b> <b>mark</b> up. This paper introduces an alternative solution, which tightly integrates the semantic structure with the text. The resulting XML markup preserves the linearity of the medical texts and can therefore be easily expanded with additional types of information...|$|E

When people browse for particular purpose the search results are obtained relevant to data or irrelevant to data. To get the desired data {{people need to}} search again from the obtained search results. To overcome this problem, we introduce an automatic marginal note method that initially arranges the data units on a resultant page of a search site into different groups. Then, for each and every group we build marginal notes from various aspects and combine the distinct labels to estimate an absolute label for it. Lastly marginal note binder for each site is dynamically constructed and used for making annotations automatically when we search newly from the same web DB...|$|E
