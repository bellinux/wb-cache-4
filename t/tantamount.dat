5|$|Boniface {{accompanied}} {{the queen and}} Prince Edward to Burgos for the marriage of Edward to Eleanor of Castile and Edward's knighting. But in 1261 Boniface held a church council at Lambeth, where a series of ecclesiastical laws were published which denounced any royal limitations on ecclesiastical courts. These decrees were done without royal consent and thus was <b>tantamount</b> to an ecclesiastical revolt against royal authority similar to the baronial opposition movement that had begun in 1258.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} {{such a thing}} would be <b>tantamount</b> to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of foreign domestic workers is being increasingly scrutinised by human-rights groups and criticised as <b>tantamount</b> to modern slavery. Documented cases of worker abuse, including the successful prosecution of an employer for subjecting Erwiana Sulistyaningsih to grievous bodily harm, assault, criminal intimidation and unpaid wages, are increasing in number. In March 2016, an NGO, Justice Centre, reported its findings that one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong were deemed {{to have been}} forced into labour.|$|E
5|$|The oppressive {{taxes and}} brutal {{collection}} methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with a sledgehammer, Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is <b>tantamount</b> to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
5|$|Valve views episodes One through Three as <b>tantamount</b> to a {{standalone}} release. Episode One {{is available}} {{as part of}} a bundle package known as The Orange Box, which also includes Half-Life 2, , Team Fortress 2, and Portal. Episode One received a generally positive critical reaction, and the co-operative aspects of the gameplay received particular praise, although the game's short length was criticized.|$|E
5|$|I Airborne Corps {{became part}} of the First Allied Airborne Army, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton, in August 1944. While retaining command of the corps, Browning also became Deputy Commander of the Army, despite a poor relationship with Brereton and being disliked by many American officers, including Major General Ridgway, now commanding the newly created U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, in turn handing over the 82nd Airborne Division to Brigadier General Gavin. During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due to differences in military culture, Brereton regarded as <b>tantamount</b> to disobeying an order. Browning was forced into a humiliating backdown.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were <b>tantamount</b> to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in {{association}} with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters to actively oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was <b>tantamount</b> to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime.|$|E
5|$|The MDC-T led by Morgan Tsvangirai {{is now the}} {{majority}} in the Lower chamber of Parliament. The MDC split into two factions. One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is <b>tantamount</b> to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.|$|E
5|$|The central RSK {{authorities}} in Knin {{learned of the}} agreement through a report filed by the 18th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina on 26 February, eight days after it was signed. The main opposition to the agreement came from Milan Martić, the RSK Interior Minister. Leadership of the ruling Serb Democratic Party accused Džakula of handing the RSK territory to Croatia. The RSK leadership considered the Daruvar Agreement <b>tantamount</b> to admission of economic unfeasibility of the RSK and an act of treason. District council of the RSK-controlled western Slavonia condemned the agreement because it was enacted only in the Croatian language, and failed to note {{the existence of the}} RSK or its administrative divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered <b>tantamount</b> to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was <b>tantamount</b> to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, a Man of Steel sequel was {{announced}} with an intended release between 2016 and 2020. In August 2015, Jon Schnepp revealed to DC Movie News on the Popcorn Network that the studio are {{rumored to have}} George Miller as the director for the sequel. In June 2016, Russel Crowe confirmed that a Man of Steel trilogy was originally planned before it was scrapped due to the announcement of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In August 2016, The Wrap reports that the studio has announced that the sequel is now in development as a top priority for the studio and getting the character right for audiences is of <b>tantamount</b> importance. The news of a standalone Superman film were later confirmed by Dany Garcia, Henry Cavill's manager. While promoting Arrival, Amy Adams confirmed work has begun on the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce {{for one of}} New Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was <b>tantamount</b> to election for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had faded as a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, {{but he would not}} be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote {{extensively}} about {{this in terms of}} the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is <b>tantamount</b> to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III's {{crowning}} in Sweden {{took place}} in 1594 amid tensions and instability caused by religious controversies. As Sigismund returned to Poland, his uncle Charles, the regent, took {{the lead of the}} anti-Sigismund Swedish opposition. In 1598 Sigismund attempted to resolve the matter militarily, but the expedition to the country of his origin was defeated at the Battle of Linköping; Sigismund was taken prisoner and had to agree to the harsh conditions imposed. After his return to Poland, in 1599 the Riksdag of the Estates deposed him in Sweden, and Charles led the Swedish forces into Estonia. Sigismund in 1600 proclaimed the incorporation of Estonia into the Commonwealth, which was <b>tantamount</b> to a declaration of war on Sweden, at the height of Rzeczpospolita's involvement in Moldavia region.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and <b>tantamount</b> to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state hands through a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E
5|$|Of the 314 {{personnel}} aboard Voyager at {{the time}} of the collision, 14 officers, 67 sailors, and 1 civilian dockyard worker were killed, including Stevens and all but two of the bridge team. A Royal Commission into the events of the collision was held in 1964, and found that while Voyager was primarily at fault for neglecting to maintain an effective lookout and awareness of the larger ship's location, Melbournes bridge crew was also at fault, for failing to alert Voyager and not taking measures to avoid the collision. Robertson was posted to the training base —a move that he and the Australian media saw as <b>tantamount</b> to a demotion—but resigned instead. The Royal Commission and its aftermath were poorly handled, and following pressure from the public, media, and politicians, combined with revelations by Voyagers former executive officer that Stevens may have been unfit for command, a second Royal Commission was opened in 1967. This is the only time in Australian history two Royal Commissions have been held for a single incident. The second commission found that Stevens was medically unfit for command and that some of the findings of the first Royal Commission were therefore based on incorrect assumptions. Robertson and the other officers of Melbourne were absolved of blame for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Treason felony, a British offence <b>tantamount</b> to treason.|$|E
25|$|Once {{it became}} clear that mereology is not <b>tantamount</b> to a denial of set theory, mereology became largely {{accepted}} as a useful tool for formal ontology and metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|La Forest {{argued that}} sexual {{orientation}} is inextricably {{relevant to the}} objective of the impugned Act given the heterosexual nature of marriage, and is not, therefore, <b>tantamount</b> to discrimination under Section 15 of the Charter.|$|E
25|$|Applying {{standard}} diffraction {{techniques to}} crystal powders or polycrystals is <b>tantamount</b> to collapsing the 3D reciprocal space, as obtained via single-crystal diffraction, onto a 1D axis. The resulting partial-to-total overlap of symmetry-independent reflections renders the structure determination process more difficult, if not impossible.|$|E
25|$|It placed minority, women's, and {{religious}} {{rights under the}} protection of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. The plan provided specific guarantees of fundamental human rights. The new states were to supply a declaration, which according to precedent was <b>tantamount</b> to a treaty.|$|E
25|$|For over 100 years, {{from before}} the Civil War until the mid-1960s, the Democratic Party {{exercised}} a virtual monopoly on Southern politics (see also Solid South). Thus elections were actually decided between Democratic factions in primary elections (often all-white); the Democratic nomination {{was considered to be}} <b>tantamount</b> to election.|$|E
25|$|In this district, {{which has}} a {{majority}} African-American population and is based in Prince George's County and Montgomery County, is heavily liberal. Incumbent Democratic Congressman Al Wynn survived a tough primary challenge from lawyer Donna Edwards, and since the Democratic primary is <b>tantamount</b> to election, Wynn was the heavy favorite to win the general election, which he ultimately did.|$|E
25|$|Since {{marriage}} is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, {{whether he or she}} is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is <b>tantamount</b> to zina, or adultery.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} {{takeover}} by Wahhabi rebels {{of most of}} Hejaz in 1803, the appointment to the governorship of Jeddah {{was said to be}} little esteemed, and considered <b>tantamount</b> to exile. Burckhardt also noted that the Pasha styled himself wali (or governor) of not only Jeddah, but also Sawakin and Habesh, and he kept custom-house officers at Sawakin and Massawa.|$|E
25|$|When long-time congressman Joe H. Eagle did {{not seek}} reelection in 1936, so he could run for the United States Senate, Thomas sought and won the Democratic nomination, which was <b>tantamount</b> to election. In that primary, Thomas beat Houston Mayor Oscar F. Holcombe in what was {{something}} of an upset. The Eighth District of Texas at that time comprised all of Harris County, which includes the state's largest city, Houston.|$|E
25|$|A group among Ali's army {{believed}} that subjecting his legitimate authority to arbitration was <b>tantamount</b> to apostasy, and abandoned his forces. This group {{was known as}} the Khawarij and ‘Ali wished to defeat their forces before they reached the cities where {{they would be able to}} blend in with the rest of the population. While he was unable to do this, he nonetheless defeated their forces in subsequent battles.|$|E
25|$|Majette {{declined}} {{to run for}} re-election to the House, opting instead to become a candidate to replace retiring Senator Zell Miller, a conservative Democrat. McKinney instantly became the favorite in the House Democratic primary. Since it was taken for granted that victory in the Democratic primary was <b>tantamount</b> to election in November, McKinney's opponents focused on clearing the field for a single candidate who could force her into a runoff election.|$|E
25|$|The old Belle Isle Bridge, which {{burned in}} April 1915, had a swing section which opened at midnight, {{preventing}} {{anyone on the}} island from reaching the mainline until the next morning. To be trapped on the island was <b>tantamount</b> to disgrace and social ostracism. All club dances ended promptly at 11:30. Long after the present bridge opened in 1923, dances at the Boat Club and Detroit Yacht Club continued to end at 11:30.|$|E
25|$|The CRTC also regulates which {{channels}} broadcast distributors must or may offer. Per the Broadcasting Act {{the commission}} also gives priority to Canadian signals—many non-Canadian channels which compete with Canadian channels are thus not approved for distribution in Canada. The CRTC argues that allowing free trade in television stations would overwhelm the smaller Canadian market, preventing it from upholding its responsibility {{to foster a}} national conversation. Some people, however, consider this <b>tantamount</b> to censorship.|$|E
25|$|First {{elected in}} the Truman {{landslide}} of 1948, he served three successive {{terms in the}} United States House of Representatives. With the South, including Texas, still mostly home to Yellow dog Democrats, winning the Democratic nomination was <b>tantamount</b> to election, and Bentsen was unopposed by Republicans {{in each of his}} three House campaigns. He became a protégé of Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn and developed a reputation as an excellent poker player.|$|E
25|$|In Narnian law and custom, talking {{animals are}} persons, fully {{the equal of}} humans; killing and eating them is <b>tantamount</b> to murder and cannibalism. On the other hand, killing and eating a non-talking animal is a {{completely}} acceptable act. Thus, for example, three talking bears are among the loyal adherents of Prince Caspian, but {{later on in the}} same book a non-talking bear is killed and eaten and Lewis gives a detailed description of how its flesh was cooked.|$|E
25|$|The report drew {{widespread}} {{criticism from}} the aquaculture industry because it called for the industry to move to ocean based closed containment within five years. According to the report, open net fish farms {{may contribute to the}} decline of wild salmon populations through the spread of parasitic sea lice and diseases from the farmed fish to migrating salmon fry. The industry claims that moving to closed-containment is <b>tantamount</b> to ending finfish aquaculture off the British Columbia coast.|$|E
25|$|On occasion, {{difficulties}} inserting the intravenous needles {{have also}} occurred, sometimes taking over {{half an hour}} to find a suitable vein. Typically, the difficulty is found in convicts with a history of intravenous drug use. Opponents argue that the insertion of intravenous lines that take excessive amounts of time are <b>tantamount</b> to being cruel and unusual punishment. In addition, opponents point to instances where the intravenous line has failed, or when adverse reactions to drugs or unnecessary delays happen during the process of execution.|$|E
