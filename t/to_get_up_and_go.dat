25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work. As Mildred tries {{to care for}} her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: {{over the course of several}} decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

60|$|There was a mystery--of {{that he felt}} sure; {{but it was no}} part of his {{business}} to seek to unravel it. The best thing he could do, he felt, was <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go.</b> He could scarcely maintain a conversation without asking or implying questions which seemed to painfully embarrass his hostess.|$|E

"I {{was more}} diffident than I had {{expected}} to be, and this was increased by the silence with which I was received when I came forward; so I seemed unable to get the fire into my speech which I had calculated upon, and presently they began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> out; {{and in a few}} minutes they all rose up and went away." ...|$|E
60|$|The next {{dance was}} beginning; {{it was the}} Barcarolle out of Hoffman, which made Helen beat her toe in time to it; but she felt that after such a {{compliment}} it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go,</b> and, besides being amused, she was really flattered, and the honesty of his conceit attracted her. She suspected {{that he was not}} happy, and was sufficiently feminine to wish to receive confidences.|$|E
60|$|I had {{proceeded}} thus far, when I found I {{had been}} lying awake so long that the very dead began to wake too, and to crowd into my thoughts most sorrowfully. Therefore, I resolved to lie awake no more, but <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> out for a night walk - which resolution was an acceptable relief to me, as I dare say it may prove now to a great many more.|$|E

60|$|Ralph {{was quite}} sure that Dora's {{deductions}} were correct, for when Miriam happened to drop asleep in {{a chair in the}} evening, it was her habit, when aroused, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to bed, too sleepy to think about anything else; but he did not think it was funny now. He was mortified that Miss Bannister should have been treated with such apparent disrespect, and he began to apologize for his sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{hundred and}} two years!" [...] I {{mechanically}} ejaculated. There was upon me the impulse <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> where I could breathe the outer air; {{to find my}} wife {{and talk to her}} about marketing or some household affair, to get away from this being--human or whatever he was--but this was impossible. That interest which dawned upon me when I first perceived my visitor now held me {{as if it had been}} a spell.|$|E
6000|$|After dinner, Hilbert, {{instead of}} going to his mother, went up upon the deck, leaving his bow and arrows, however, down in the cabin. As Rollo and Jennie were, at that time, seated near the after part of the {{promenade}} deck, he came and sat down near them. Rollo had a great desire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> away, taking Jennie with him; but he feared that it would be impolite for him to do so; and while he was considering what he should do, the surgeon came along that way, and said to them,-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Combining orchestral disco styles with a Donald Duck-esque {{voice as}} the main plot point, the story within [...] "Disco Duck" [...] centers around a man at a dance party who is {{overcome}} by the urge <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> [...] "get down" [...] in a duck-like manner. When the music stops, he sits down, but when he decides <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> dance again, he finds {{that everyone in the}} room is now doing his dance.|$|R

60|$|That {{hour with}} him was very bad. He {{did not know how}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> away, or how to keep his place. For some time he sat with his hat off, forgetful of his {{privilege}} of wearing it; and then put it on hurriedly, as though the fact of his not wearing it must have been observed by everybody. At last, at about two, the debate was adjourned, and then as he was slowly leaving the House, thinking how he might creep away without companionship, Mr. Monk took him by the arm.|$|E
60|$|At length {{the gray}} {{light of the}} morning began to shine in at his little round window. This he was very glad to see, {{although}} it did not promise any decided relief to his misery; for the storm still continued with unabated violence. At length, when breakfast time came, the chambermaid brought in some tea and toast for Maria and for both the children. They took it, and felt much better for it--so much so, that Rollo said he meant <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> and see the storm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master, I went. Margaret {{was sitting}} in her room all alone {{in the cold and}} dark, staring at the wall. I told her what our father had said. She never let on she heard me. I pleaded and wept, Master. I did what I had never done to any human creature--I kneeled to her and begged her, as she hoped for mercy herself, to come down and see our dying father. Master, she wouldn't! She never moved or looked at me. I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> downstairs and tell that old man she would not come." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{fact that}} she did not have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to the office was Una's chief {{impression}} at awakening, but she was not entirely obtuse to the morning, to the chirp of a robin, the cluck of the hens, the creak of a hay-wagon, and the sweet smell of cattle. When she arose she looked down a slope of fields so far away that they seemed smooth as a lawn. Solitary, majestic trees cast long shadows over a hilly pasture of crisp grass worn to inviting paths by the cropping cattle. Beyond the valley was a range of the Berkshires with every tree distinct.|$|E

"Well, if that's the case," [...] Frank said, [...] "we must {{modify the}} arrangement, and agree {{that none of}} us will go into a bar unless {{actually}} asked to go and take a drink--that wouldn't be very often, the invitation is generally given inside. We come back from work about the same time that every one else knocks off, and they are not thinking of going to the bars till they have had a meal, and when we are once quietly seated round the fire here no one is very likely to ask any of us <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> off to one of the saloons." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{as he lay}} there, {{the past}} night began to {{reconstruct}} itself in his brain. He hadn’t been sick at all, was his thought; he had merely been drunk, {{and it was time}} for him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work. Work suggested his mine, and he remembered that he had refused ten thousand dollars for it. He sat up abruptly and squeezed open his eyes. He saw himself in a boat, floating on the swollen brown flood of the Yukon. The spruce-covered shores and islands were unfamiliar. He was stunned for a time. He couldn’t make it out. He could remember the last night’s orgy, but there was no connection between that and his present situation.|$|E
