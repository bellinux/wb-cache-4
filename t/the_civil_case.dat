5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{team was}} largely that which had opposed the Claimant in <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case,</b> minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew, both future judges. The Claimant's team was significantly weaker; {{he would not}} reengage Ballantine, and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly because they knew {{they would have to}} present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant's backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld. Kenealy's task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown's lawyers. Other key witnesses from <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case,</b> including Moore, Baigent and Lipscombe, likewise would not give evidence at the criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 President Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Harrison {{to represent}} {{the federal government in}} a civil suit filed by Lambdin P. Milligan, whose controversial wartime conviction for treason in 1864 led to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case known as Ex parte Milligan. <b>The</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case</b> was referred to the U.S. Circuit Court for Indiana at Indianapolis, where it evolved into Milligan v. Hovey. Although the jury rendered a verdict in Milligan's favor and he had sought {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in damages, state and federal statutes limited the amount the federal government had to award to Milligan to five dollars plus court costs.|$|E
5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case</b> that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E

[...] To support this interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights <b>Cases,</b> <b>the</b> Court quoted one of the Congressmen who had supported the law that <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights <b>Cases</b> struck down: [...] "There were state {{laws on the books}} bespeaking equality of treatment, but in the administration of these laws there was discrimination against newly freed slaves." [...] To the majority, this quote indicated that the law deemed unconstitutional in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights <b>Cases</b> was meant to combat the same kind of disparate treatment against which VAWA was aimed.|$|R

5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} of child sexual abuse, but <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>case</b> was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication. Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry. In October 2017, Forbes announced that Jackson had topped the publication's list of top-earning dead celebrities for the fifth straight year with annual earnings of $75 million.|$|E

Allred stated she believes the defense will try to use the deposition against Shapiro to find discrepancies in the upcoming criminal trial. Cosby attorney Angela Agrusa is opposing this motion.

2500|$|The {{majority}} {{reaffirmed the}} state action doctrine, and specifically reaffirmed the results reached in United States v.

In <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights <b>Cases,</b> <b>the</b> Court had held that the Equal Protection Clause applied only to acts done by states, not to acts done by private individuals. [...] Because <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights Act of 1875 applied to racial discrimination in private establishments, the Court said in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights <b>Cases,</b> it exceeded congressional enforcement power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. [...] In Harris, the Court ruled that the Clause {{did not apply to}} a prison lynching, since the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply to private actors, as opposed to state actors.

25|$|On June 7, 2011, Flint Farmer was {{fatally shot}} {{three times in}} the back by Chicago police officer Gildardo Sierra. Sierra and a partner had responded to a {{domestic}} disturbance call allegedly involving Farmer. When confronted by the police, Farmer fled. Sierra shot at Farmer multiple times, hitting him in the leg and abdomen. Publicly available police video shows Sierra circle the prone Farmer as three bright flashes emit from approximately waist level. The coroner who performed the autopsy on Farmer reported that Farmer could have survived the shots to the leg and abdomen, but any of the three shots through the back would have been fatal. Officer Sierra had been involved in two other shootings in 2011. Although the Chicago police department ruled the shooting justified, by October 23, 2011 Sierra had been stripped of his police powers and the FBI had opened an investigation into the incident.

According {{to a friend of}} Presley's, [...] "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs.
