The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E

At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater.

40|$|Abstract: In {{assessing}} <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> {{of information}} communication technologies (ICTs) on tourism businesses, this study adopted {{a case study}} blueprint, with a questionnaire survey being used to collect data from selected tourism businesses. The respondents rated ICT impacts on tourism on a 5 - point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The results show that <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> on hotels were perceived as ranging from 4. 07 (improved company image) to 4. 92 (increased market share), whereas <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> on bed and breakfast establishments were perceived as ranging from 3. 88 (improved company image) to 4. 86 (speeded up service). <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> on travel agents were perceived as ranging from 4. 48 (improved service quality) to 4. 94 (improved service quality), whereas <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> on tour guides were perceived as ranging from 4. 58 (improved company image) to 4. 81 (heightened customer satisfaction levels). <b>The</b> <b>impacts</b> on backpackers were perceived as ranging from 3. 78 (improved company image) to 4. 75 (increased market share).
