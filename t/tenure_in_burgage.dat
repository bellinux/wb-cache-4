30|$|To {{summarize}} {{our results}} about the returns to {{different types of}} specific human capital, we find a strong return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the formal sector, but no significant return to <b>tenure</b> <b>in</b> the informal sector. Our estimates of 10 -year returns to employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure indicate that formal sector tenure matters more than other specific human capital, namely employer or occupation <b>tenure.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the strong return to formal sector tenure, we find significant returns to potential experience with and without controlling for sector tenure, {{which is consistent with}} previous findings in the literature.|$|R
