5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E
25|$|En {{route to}} the target, the Israeli planes crossed the Gulf of Aqaba. Unknowingly, the {{squadron}} flew directly over the yacht of King Hussein of Jordan, who was vacationing in the Gulf at the time. Hussein witnessed the planes overfly his yacht, and noticed their Israeli markings. Taking into account the location, heading, and armament of the jets, Hussein quickly deduced the Iraqi reactor {{to be the most}} probable target. Hussein immediately contacted his government and ordered a warning to be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis.</b> However, due to a communication failure the message was never received and the Israeli planes entered Iraqi airspace undetected.|$|E

The United States also provided strategic operational advice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> to better use their assets in combat... The CIA, including both CIA Director Casey and Deputy Director Gates, knew of, approved of, and assisted in the sale of non-U.S. origin military weapons, ammunition and vehicles to Iraq.

2500|$|The American {{military}} {{commitment that}} had begun with intelligence-sharing expanded rapidly and surreptitiously throughout the Iran–Iraq War.

2500|$|If the [...] "Bear Spares" [...] were {{manufactured}} {{outside the}} United States, then the U.S. could arrange for {{the provision of}} these weapons to a third country without direct involvement. Israel, for example, had a very large stockpile of Soviet weaponry and ammunition captured during its various wars. At the suggestion of the United States, the Israelis would transfer the spare parts and weapons to third countries... Similarly, Egypt manufactured weapons and spare parts from Soviet designs and provided these weapons and ammunition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> and other countries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} British {{plan was}} replaced by Operation Sinbad which was acceptable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> and was executed from September 2006 to February 2007. Along with other Coalition commanders, Stirrup viewed Sinbad as insufficient {{because it did not}} involve directly attacking the militias. [...] Believing that it would not deliver the level of improvements in security that the British wanted, Stirrup began looking at the high risk strategy of withdrawing British troops from inside Basra which would have left the Iraqis in the position of either having to deal with the security problems themselves or losing control of Iraq's second city.|$|E

50|$|However, {{this number}} {{could be an}} {{overestimate}} and may include some civilian fatalities, since there have been contradictions between the figures released by the U.S. military and those released by <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government.
