40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the levels of sex hormones in men with {{hyperthyroidism}} before and during treatment, and determining the feasibility of testosterone prescribing together with <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy, in men with androgen deficiency. The study involved 37 men with newly diagnosed diffuse toxic goiter and 16 healthy men, aged from 22 to 55 years. The testosterone (test.) fractions (overall and free), SHBG, LH, FSH, estradiol and prolactin were determined. All hormones were measured before treatment and after 3, and then 6 months of <b>thyrostatic</b> ther apy. The overall test. level in men with hyperthyroidism was the same as in healthy subjects. Absolute and relative content of free test. fraction was significantly lower, but the SHBG level was higher than in healthy age relative men. The diagnostics of androgen deficiency syndrome was based on free test. determination. All patients with Diffuse toxic goiter the tiamazol (Merkazolil) was appointed, while treatment with testosterone (Omnadren 250) were offered to patients with low of free test. levels, but not all followed the recommendations. The groups were follow: patients without androgen deficiency (n = 16), patients with androgen deficiency, taking only <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy (n = 10), patients with androgen deficiency taken <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy simultaneously with testosterone therapy (n = 11). The decreasing of free test. level was detected in 57 % of examined men. In most cases (80 %) of that patients the 6 months <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy did not lead to free test. normalization. The free test. level concentration was nor mal only in 2 examined not receiving testosterone men (20 %) and in 9 (82 %; χ 2 = 5. 76; p = 0. 017) among those who recieved both: <b>thyrostatic</b> and testosterone therapy. During treatment with Omnadren 250 the relative content of free test. was significantly higher at 3 and 6 months of treatment. Using a questionnaire AMS confirmed the dynamics characteristics of androgen deficiency in men with hyperthyroidism during treatment.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of structural and functional state of thyroid gland was studied, {{as well as}} the levels of antithyroid antibodies in patients with diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) during long-term treatment with <b>thyrostatic</b> agents. Objective of the study — to perform the analysis of changes in the levels of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAbs), antibodies to thyreoproxidase (ATPO) at DTG manifestation and during long-term drug therapy, as well as to determine TRAbs levels in relapsing course of disease. Materials and methods. 112 patients with DTG were examined. The duration of the disease at the examination beginning was from 1 month to 15 years. All patients were divided into two groups depending on the DTG duration: the first group consisted of 46 patients with disease duration up to 1 year (3. 96 months in average), the second one consisted of 66 patients with disease duration more than 1 year (3. 32 years in average). This distribution was specified by desire to study the {{dynamics of}} antithyroid antibody levels at disease manifestation and during long-term course of autoimmune process. Results. On the background of <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy, the number of patients with focal thyroid gland formations increased. When analyzing the levels of antithyroid antibodies at baseline, it was revealed that ATPO level in both groups of patients with DTG significantly exceeded the performance of the control group (group 1 — 283. 33 ± 86. 61 U/ml vs 35. 65 ± 4. 90 U/ml; group 2 — 207. 34 ± 42. 52 U/ml vs 35. 65 ± ±  4. 90 U/ml) and did not depend on disease duration and preliminary treatment duration. In 6 months of treatment, the level of ATPO in both groups was not decreased. The study of TRAbs dynamics during <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy revealed that in patients of the first and second groups, the decrease of TRAbs level was noted only 6 – 12 months after the start of <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy (group 1 — from 17. 19  ± 2. 17  IU/l to 6. 95 ± 2. 39 IU/l, p < 0. 05; group 2 — from 14. 20 ± 2. 04 IU/l to 5. 81  ± 2. 26 IU/l, p < 0. 05). In 24 months of treatment, the recurrence of thyrotoxicosis has been detected in 24 patients (21. 4  %). The study of TRAbs levels in patients with relapsing course of the disease revealed their significant increase (24. 27 ± 2. 86 IU/l vs 12. 28 ± 3. 57 IU/l). In 6 months of <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy, the levels of TRAbs in patients with relapses do not significantly decreased and were significantly higher than similar rates in patients with DTG in remission (17. 22 ± 3. 37 IU/l vs 4. 64 ± 1. 99 IU/l). Conclusions. In patients with DTG, TRAbs level decreases in only 6 – 12 months after the beginning of <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy. The patients with relapsing course of the disease have significantly larger sizes of goiter, {{as well as the}} levels of TRAbs, which in 6 months of continuous treatment far exceeded the normal values and indicators of patients with remission...|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyrostatics</b> (antithyroid drugs) are {{drugs that}} inhibit the {{production}} of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US), and propylthiouracil. <b>Thyrostatics</b> are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4).

50|$|Until 1980, the use {{of growth}} hormones, both {{endogenous}} and exogenous, was completely prohibited in (as noted above) Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Greece.

This review presents and discusses the main etiopathogenetical and clinical aspects of hypothyroid coma (HC) and thyrotoxic storm (TS), including therapeutic strategy flow-charts. Furthermore, a special chapter is dedicated to the approach to massive goiter, which represents a surgical thyroid emergency. Data source. We searched the electronic MEDLINE database to September 2013. Data selection and Data extraction. Reviews, original articles and case reports on myxedematous coma, hypothyroid coma, thyroid storm, thyrotoxic storm, massive goiter, huge goiter, prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, therapy, prognosis were selected. Data synthesis and conclusions. Severe excess or defect of thyroid hormone are rare conditions which jeopardize the life of patients in most cases. Both HC and TS are triggered by precipitating factors, which occur in patients with severe hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis, respectively. The pillars of HC therapy are: high dose l-thyroxine and/or tri-iodothyroinine; i. v. glucocorticoids; treatment of hydro-electrolyte imbalance (mainly, hyponatraemia); treatment of hypothermia; not rarely, endotracheal intubation and assisted mechanic ventilation are needed. Therapy of TS is based on beta-blockers, <b>thyrostatics,</b> and i. v. glucocorticoids; eventually, high-dose iodide compounds or lithium carbonate may be of benefit. Surgery represents the gold standard treatment in patients with euthyroid massive nodular goiter, although new techniques – e. g., percutaneous laser ablation - are helpful in subjects at high surgical risk or refusing operation...|$|R

Examination revealed tachycardia (100 /min), mild exophthalmus and a small goitre. INVESTIGATIONS: A decreased basal TSH level (0. 002 mU/ml), raised peripheral thyroid hormone (fT 4 6. 7 ng/dl, total T 3 7. 8 micrograms/l) and a TSH receptor antibody titre of 33. 4 U/l) were compatible with immune type Graves' disease. Radiology revealed an upper mediastinal space-occupying lesion which scintigraphically was separate from thyroid tissue. A metastasis of the osteosarcoma or thymus hyperplasia were considered the most likely cause.

40|$|Abstract: Nodular goiter {{encompasses}} {{a spectrum of}} diseases from the incidental asyntomatic small solitary nodule to the large intrathoracic goiter causing pressure symptoms as well as functional complaints. The mainstay in the diagnostic evaluation is related to functional and morphological characterization with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), ultrasound (US) and other imaging procedures and cytology by fine needle aspiration (FNA) {{on the basis of}} the different diseases. A clinical classification considering solitary cyst, adenomatous functioning nodule, follicular lesion and multinodular goiter may be proposed to consider the alternative therapies other than surgery as TSH suppressive or <b>thyrostatic</b> treatment, (131) I therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) or the only clinical exam in benignant lesions. Surgery should be advocated for the treatment of thyroid nodules whenever a patient presents with either pressure symptoms, hyperthyroidism or follicular/indeterminate cytology. Surgical approach, intraoperatory strategy and the extension of surgical treatment are correlated to the different clinical categories. At surgery the frozen section analysis in case of hemithyroidectomy is of aid to rule out malignancy and to prevent the reoperation. The surgical treatment of choice in case of uninodular goiter is lobectomy, total thyroidectomy or near total thyroidectomy is the correct treatment of multinodular bilateral goiter.

There were no differences in BW or resting energy expenditure (REE) between visits. At visit 1, after 13. 5 (9. 5 – 48. 0) months of BRT, serum free (F) T 4 correlated positively with REE (= 0. 433, = 0. 044) and negatively with body fat % (=− 0. 450, = 0. 035).

In patients with overt thyrotoxicosis, formation of all types of left ventricular pathological remodeling was associated with male gender, age older than 44 years, the presence of systolic hypertension, duration of the disease with the lack of stable compensation of hyperthyroidism for more than 20 months. In patients with overt thyrotoxicosis, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure occurs much more frequently than in patients who had subclinical hyperthyroidism (16. 5 and 7 %; 40 and 32 %; 8. 6 and 4. 5 %, respectively). Both overt and subclinical thyrotoxicosis {{led to the development of}} endothelial dysfunction, the incidence and severity of which was greater in autoimmune origin of thyrotoxicosis (impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the immune origin was observed in 79 % of patients, with non-immune origin — in 13. 3 % of cases, the level of von Willebrand factor was higher in the immune origin of hyperthyroidism in 53 % of patients, with non-immune origin — in 20 %, and its average level was within the normal range in this group).

Examples are classifying a material according to value, or safety decisions such as ''no action required, all is well", The nature of the decision determines the requirements put to the analysis such as the quantitative ones, e. g. limits of detection, or the qualitative ones, e. g. amount of certainty, that the identification of a compound is unambiguous. The classical approach to unambiguity is a detailed description of procedures. However, this approach has some drawbacks. A standard method by virtue of its immobility is apt to become old-fashioned. Modern highly sophisticated apparatus ask for dedicated analytical procedures, which are not generally applicable. Changes in custom-made reagents or equipment force adaptation of the procedure. For quantitative analysis the flexibility can be attained by a system of quality parameters. These are inadequate for qualitative analysis. In order to create a system in which well-defined limits of ambiguity can be set we have introduced the concept of "quality criteria" to be applied to the identification method(s) used. The quality criteria for each detection method have to be stated and adopted by a board of experts for that detection method. But, once an analysis fulfils the adopted criteria of a detection method, the presence of the investigated analyte in the sample can be taken as proved within the limits of ambiguity chosen for the decision process. In particular for spectrometric identification methods such quality criteria are of essential interest.

40|$|In {{patients}} with Graves' disease, initiation of <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy with methimazole causes a selective reduction of thyroid but not other autoantibody levels. The mechanism of this immunosuppressive effect is unknown. In the present study, methimazole (20 mg daily) induced very rapid {{changes in the}} surface antigen expression of several circulating lymphocyte subpopulations in six {{patients with}} Graves' disease. Within 1 to 3 days of therapy, the proportions of HLA-DR+ cells within the CD 8 +(Leu 2 +) subset (activated 'suppressor/cytotoxic' T cells), CD 11 +(Leu 15 +) cells out of CD 8 + cells ('suppressor' T cells), and CD 45 +R (Leu 18 +) cells out of CD 4 +(LEU 3 +) cells ('suppressor/inducer' T cells) increased significantly from 4. 7 +/- 3. 9 % to 9. 5 +/- 6. 0 %, from 7. 5 +/- 1. 5 % to 17 +/- 5. 8 % and from 49 +/- 17 % to 73 +/- 19 %, respectively. In parallel, the percentages of DR+ cells within the CD 4 +(Leu 3 +) subset (activated 'helper' T cells), 4 F 2 + cells out of CD 19 +(Leu 12 +) cells (activated B cells) and 4 F 2 + cells out of CD 16 +(Leu 11 +) cells (activated 'natural killer'-like cells) declined significantly from 7. 2 +/- 5. 6 % to 2. 8 +/- 2. 1 %, from 7. 2 +/- 1. 5 % to 4. 0 +/- 2. 8 % and from 5. 5 +/- 3. 5 % to 2. 8 +/- 4. 9 % at 3 days, respectively.

40|$|Objective — {{to study}} Adaptol {{efficiency}} {{in patients with}} diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) of varying severity with deviations in the emotional sphere without expressed psychoorganic disorders, as well as impact of the drug on the efficiency of main <b>thyrostatic</b> therapy that allows to expand the range of indications {{for the use of}} the drug in the practice of endocrinologists. Materials and methods. We observed 25 patients with thyrotoxicosis in a state of drug subcompensation (17  — with the overt one, which developed as a result of DTG, and 8  — with subclinical one), who received Adaptol in combination treatment for two months (group I). Another 20 patients with similar pathology formed the control group (group II). Patients in the control group did not differ statistically significantly by the age, sex, duration and severity of DTG from those of the main group. Results. The analysis of the findings indicates that in the first (main) group of patients with DTG (with additional administration of Adaptol), there is a more significant effect of treatment compared with patients in the control group. Additional use of Adaptol helped to reduce the daily dose of thyrostatics in patients with DTG that reduces the risk of complications of the therapy. If the average daily dose of thiamazole/carbimazole at the beginning of treatment in the examined groups of patients did not differ, then after 2 months of treatment, the mean dose of thyrostatics in the first group was 24. 3 ± 2. 1 mg, in the control group — 31. 8 ± 2. 4 mg (p < 0. 05). During therapy with Adaptol, there was a decrease (p < 0. 05) in the content of malondialdehyde, as well as increase in the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes: superoxide dismutase (p < 0. 05) and glutathione peroxidase (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. After 2 months of Adaptol therapy, according to the Hamilton scale, patients of the main group hadn’t anxiety states (5. 6 ± 1. 2 points; p < 0. 05), whereas in the control group, there were symptoms of anxiety (14. 8 ± 2. 7 points; p < 0. 05). Adaptol has a positive therapeutic effect on both the oxidant and antioxidant systems that manifests by inhibition of lipid peroxidation and activation of compensatory processes. In view of the research, application of Adaptol must take the proper place in the schemes of treatment for DTG and to expand its possibilities in case of both mild and long-term course of the disease...|$|E

Ziel dieser Dissertation war es, den Langzeiterfolg der Radioiodtherapie bei der Autoimmunthyreopathie vom Typ Morbus Basedow bei Zweit- und Dritttherapie am Beispiel des Krankengutes der Klinik und Poliklinik für Nuklearmedizin der Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg zu analysieren und einen Bezug zu den weiterhin kontrovers diskutierten Einflussfaktoren bei einer Ersttherapie herzustellen. In dieser retrospektiven Studie wurden die Daten von 106 Patienten, die in der Klinik und Poliklinik für Nuklearmedizin im Zeitraum 1998 bis 2000 mit einem Rezidiv nach einer Radioiodtherapie eines Morbus Basedow mit einer 2. bzw. 3. Radioiodtherapie behandelt wurden, uni- und multivariaten Analysen unterzogen. Als prädiktive Einflussfaktoren auf den Langzeiterfolg bei einer 2. Radioiodtherapie lassen sich Volumen, Iodumsatz und thyreostatische Medikation eruieren. Mangels ausreichender Fallzahlen wurde nicht untersucht ob ein bestimmtes Geschlecht oder Alter für ein Rezidiv und damit eine 2. bzw. eine 3. Radioiodtherapie prädisponieren. Ebenfalls hatte die thyreoidale Stoffwechsellage keine Vorraussagekraft. Aufgrund eines feststellbar erhöhten Iodumsatzes bei Hyperthyreose ist aber eine ausgeglichene Hormonlage anzustreben. Die Ergebnisse lassen den Schluss zu, dass weitere, zum Teil noch nicht bekannte und in dieser Dissertation nicht untersuchte Variablen den Ausgang der Radioiodtherapie wesentlich mitbeeinflussen. Als Konsequenz dieser Untersuchung scheint eine Anhebung der angestrebten Dosis bei einer 1. Radioiodtherapie auf 250 – 300 Gy sinnvoll, da dies bei einer 2. Radioiodtherapie wirksam war und somit zu einer Reduktion der Rezidivrate führen könnte. The {{influencing}} factors long on term success of initial radioiodine therapy are controversialy discussed. Aim {{of this project}} was to analyse the long term results in patients with Graves´disease treated with a second or third radioiodine therapy. The collected data was then compared {{to the results of}} the first radioiodine therapy. In this retrospective study the data of 106 patiens was collected. All individuall suffered from Graves` disease and were treated with a second or third radiodine therapy. Thyroid volume, iodine turnover and <b>thyrostatic</b> medication were identified to be predictive influencing variables on long term success of the second radiodine therapy. Due to a lack of a statistical relevant number of patient we were unable to investigate if a certain gender or age predisposed to a relapse with need of a second or third radiodine intervention. In this study the thyroid function had no influence on the clinical outcome. However, before entering the therapeutic regime, a balanced hormone level has to be reached due to the higher iodine turnover on hyperthyroid patients. We concluded that further variables which are still partially unknown influence the outcome of the radiodine therapy essentially. As a consequence of this investigation an increase of the target dose at initial radioiodine therapy to 250 – 300 Gy seems reasonable because this dosage was successful during the second radiodine therapy.

Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to get insight into the hormonal action of prohormones and to develop novel in vitro and in vivo screening methods allowing effective surveillance on the illegal use of prohormones in livestock production. Hereby the emphasis was on developing effect based approaches to better meet Council Directive 96 / 22 /EC. The bioactivity {{of a wide variety of}} supplements which contained prohormones were tested using a yeast androgen bioassay. For supplements containing solely prohormones the value of this bioactivity based screening appeared to be limited as they require metabolism to become active. Therefore, screening methods for animal feed, supplements and preparations were set-up by using the same yeast androgen bioassay in combination with bovine liver models as well as enzymatic and chemical deconjugation procedures to mimic in vivo metabolic bioactivation. The use of either bovine liver S 9, liver slices, pure enzymes or alkaline hydrolysis showed that prohormones could be activated, resulting in a significant increase in bioactivity as determined by the androgen yeast bioassay. For the detection of prohormone abuse at the farm and/or slaughterhouse the usefulness of ‘omics’ based profiling techniques was investigated. Within this scope a comprehensive metabolomics based screening strategy for steroid urine profiling was developed. Comparison of urinary profiles revealed large differences between the profiles of controls and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as pregnenolone treated animals. Moreover this steroid urine profiling approach allowed identification of biomarkers for treatment by specific prohormones. This resulted in respectively 7 and 12 specific mass peak loadings which could potentially be used as biomarkers for pregnenolone and DHEA treatment. In addition, the feasibility of a liver gene expression profiling approach was investigated to monitor the effects of DHEA treatment at the transciptome level. It was shown that identification and application of genomic biomarkers for screening of DHEA abuse in cattle is substantially hampered by biological variation. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that comparison of pre-defined gene sets versus the whole genome expression profile of an animal allows to distinguish DHEA treatment effects from variations in gene expression due to inherent biological variation. Altogether the results of this thesis increase the knowledge about the metabolism and bioactivation of prohormones in vitro as well as in vivo. Based on this knowledge, a panel of new effect based concepts and screening methods was developed that complement and improve the current testing programs. These new concepts will facilitate better implementation of the European ban on growth promoters in livestock production as described in Council Directive 96 / 22 /EC...|$|E
