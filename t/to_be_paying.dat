During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paying</b> dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve. Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} part of the film's Asia release, Variety {{reported}} that the film enjoyed a tremendous start to its theatrical run across East Asia since its release date on 10 July 2008. The film scored a record-breaking opening weekend across six Asian territories. Variety also reported that the film received a generally positive critical reception in Hong Kong, China. In South Korea, the opening day of Red Cliff knocked Hancock down to 79,000 admissions Thursday, or an estimated gross of $550,000. The film also drew more than 1.6 million viewers in South Korea— about 130,000 more than the Batman sequel The Dark Knight. At a budget of US$80 million, along with media scrutiny over its lengthy and troubled shoot, including the death of a stunt man and the hospitalisation of its producer, the film was thought by many a big financial gamble, but industry insiders reported that good word-of-mouth and positive reviews appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paying</b> off for the film's strong box-office revenue.|$|E
500|$|The {{handicap}} principle {{has proven}} hard to test empirically, {{partly because of}} inconsistent interpretations of Zahavi’s metaphor and Grafen’s marginal fitness model, {{and partly because of}} conflicting empirical results: in some studies individuals with bigger signals seem to pay higher costs, in other studies they seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>paying</b> lower costs. [...] A possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results is given in a series of papers by Getty, who shows that Grafen’s proof of the handicap principle is based on the critical simplifying assumption that signallers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency. But the assumption that costs and benefits trade off in an additive fashion is true only on a logarithmic scale; for the survival cost – reproduction benefit tradeoff is assumed to mediate the evolution of sexually selected signals. Fitness depends on producing offspring, which is a multiplicative function of reproductive success given an individual is still alive times the probability of still being alive, given investment in signals.|$|E
