50|$|Following {{the market}} decline, Trans-Lux {{management}} learned that their electronic display sales {{should not be}} overly dependent on a single industry, and decided to diversify. The company formed an industrial sales department in 1970 {{under the leadership of}} Louis Credidio, who went after the commodity market and in 1971 sold an adaptation of the Personal Ticker, the T-900, to the Chicago Board of Trade. Soon Trans-Lux completed sales to many other commodity exchanges, capturing a small but significant new market. When Extel's teleprinter terminal sales boomed, it contracted Trans-Lux to manufacture keyboards and way-station selectors, which led to Trans-Lux's entry into the teleprinter market. Credidio studied the <b>telex</b> <b>terminal</b> field and by 1974 Trans-Lux began marketing a <b>telex</b> <b>terminal,</b> the Trans-Lux Teleprinter (TLT), to several industries. More than 700 terminals were installed by 1975.|$|E
5000|$|By 1984 {{the basic}} Mailbox service had been {{extended}} to give automatic access to the Telex service {{which at the time}} was still relatively common in business and was the standard way to reach remoter parts of the globe. Using a special Telex Link page, the message was composed in the usual way and then the destination country chosen and the Telex number entered before sending just like a standard message. Telex Link added the necessary Telex codes as required and tried to send the message as many times as required before positively confirming receipt by means of a special Mailbox message. Telexes could be sent to Prestel Mailbox users from a standard <b>Telex</b> <b>terminal</b> by using Telex Link number and inserting [...] "MBX" [...] and the relevant mailbox number as the first line of the telex message itself. The incoming telex message appeared to the Prestel recipient just as an ordinary Mailbox message but with the telex number inserted {{at the top of the}} frame.|$|E
5000|$|Telex {{messages}} are routed by addressing {{them to a}} telex address, e.g., [...] "14910 ERIC S", where 14910 is the subscriber number, ERIC is an abbreviation for the subscriber's name (in this case Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson in Sweden) and S is the country code. Solutions also exist for the automatic routing of messages to different <b>telex</b> <b>terminals</b> within a subscriber organization, by using different terminal identities, e.g., [...] "+T148".|$|R
2500|$|The JIS {{standard}} layout includes Japanese kana {{in addition}} to a QWERTY style layout. The shifted values of many keys (digits, together with [...] ) are a legacy of bit-paired keyboards, dating to ASCII <b>telex</b> machines and <b>terminals</b> of the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|A {{key benefit}} of the {{terminals}} {{was that they were}} IBM compatible but cost less. This meant discounts for volume customers made the terminals attractive. Reflecting the profit contribution made by Alfaskop (other product ranges at Stansaab/Datasaab were losing money), Ericsson invested 40 million kronor in the manufacturing facility at JÃ¤rfalla outside Stockholm. [...] Ericsson had predicted that their Eritex workstation comprising a <b>telex</b> and data <b>terminal</b> would take over from Alfaskop but demand continued with 100,000 units sold by 1983 with annual sales climbing above 25,000. [...] Eritex was retired by the mid-1980s. Deliveries of Alfaskop continued through the Nokia years and by the time production ceased, more than 900 000 units had been shipped.|$|R
50|$|The {{night before}} the October 21, 1967 March on the Pentagon, Bloom, Mungo and the other staffers convened a chaotic meeting in a Washington loft with {{underground}} press editors {{from around the country}} who were in town to cover the march; but they failed to reach an agreement to create a democratic structure in which LNS would be owned and run by its member papers. Operating on their own with a volunteer staff of 12, Bloom and Mungo moved forward with ambitious plans for the expansion of LNS. In December they opened an international Telex line to Oxford, England; and later that winter LNS merged with the Student Communications Network (SCN), based in Berkeley, which had its own nationwide <b>Telex</b> network with <b>terminals</b> in Berkeley, Los Angeles, New York, Ann Arbor, Ames, Iowa, Chicago and Philadelphia, leased from Western Union. In February 1968 LNS took over the SCN office in New York, which had just been opened by former Columbia graduate student George Cavalletto and others in a converted Chinese restaurant on Claremont Avenue in Harlem. Walking by, Steve Diamond saw a brand new Telex machine sitting in an otherwise empty storefront and a sign seeking volunteers, and attended a meeting shortly afterward at which the New York staff was formed. Two months after it opened the New York office became a central focus for LNS activity during the Columbia University student uprising in April 1968, as a continual stream of bulletins going out over the Telex kept underground papers and radio stations across country up to the minute on the latest developments in the Columbia strike. To young radicals across the country {{it seemed as if the}} revolution had come.|$|R
