For an unexplained reason, the aircraft pitch trim {{was moved to}} the full nose-down position, which exceeded the ability of the autopilot to control, and the aircraft pitched over abruptly. [...] The abrupt pitch over caused the generators <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> line and the loss of AC electrical power prevented the pitch trim from being operated normally. [...] The aircraft became uncontrollable and exploded at about 1,500ft MSL. [...] The crash occurred near Walkersville, MD at 10:50L. [...] All seventeen crew members and four passengers on board the aircraft were killed.|$|E
2500|$|Rule {{concluded}} that {{the primary cause of}} the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 9:11 a.m., causing the main coolant pumps <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> <b>off.</b> This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. Thresher could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so it sank. Rule's analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that Thresher was intact until it imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of Skylark did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and Skylark was able to communicate with Thresher, despite the fact that even a small leak at test depth would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of Thresher testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a [...] "minor problem".|$|E

40|$|Abstract — System {{frequency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters of a power system. Due to generation-load mismatches, the system frequency can vary over a small range. When the power consumed by loads and overall losses is greater than the generated power, the operating frequency of the system will decrease, resulting in a situation known as the underfrequency condition. In some other case, if some of the loads in a system are disconnected from the system suddenly, or lost, it leads to a condition called as the overfrequency condition. This condition is characterised by greater input power than the consumed power by the loads. The rest of the loads in the system will absorb the extra power and the generator inertia, leading to an increase in the system frequency. In both the cases, the system frequency fluctuates from the power system’s limited frequency range, futher leading <b>to</b> <b>tripping</b> <b>off</b> of the substation an...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to [...] "Friday"'s release, movies such as Boyz n the Hood (also {{starring}} Ice Cube) and Colors portrayed life in {{the hood}} as violent and menacing.

The HVDC controls automatically cut northbound transfer from 1000 MW to 140 MW, causing automatic under-frequency load shedding (AUFLS) systems to deploy in the North Island and blacking out thousands of customers.

50|$|There is no {{provision}} for operation during a power failure, when the base reverts to generator power. This would require limiting the output to {{less than or equal}} to what the generators can provide. Otherwise a cloud could pass over and cause the sudden drop in output to overload the generators, causing them <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> <b>off.</b> If a pumped-hydro facility was added in the nearby hills, that would allow the base to operate during power failures under solar power, although batteries would also be needed to allow time for the hydro-electric plant to adjust to the load requirements.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the importance of}} recruitment, properly functioning succession plans and individual development plans; how required training needs are diagnosed; and how a combined simulator and training program is being developed to improve Dynamic Positioning Operator (DPO) understanding of the operation of these complex integrated systems.

An advanced simulator will {{have the ability to}} present the DPO {{with a wide range of}} failure modes that cannot easily be duplicated on an operating vessel, but which have caused loss of location numerous times. These failures will be different from the types now used, akin to a thruster or engine tripping off line.

50|$|The {{electrical}} fault described above also affected unit 2 by causing breakers in the 230kv switchyard <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> cutting <b>off</b> power <b>to</b> RAT 2-B and vital bus B on unit 2. EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored {{power to the}} vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on unit 2's main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated and opened the transformer's output breaker causing a full load rejection to unit 2 which led <b>to</b> a turbine <b>trip</b> and reactor scram. After the unit tripped, the B non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (which is powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B causing two of the reactor coolant pumps {{and one of the}} main feedwater pumps <b>to</b> <b>trip,</b> though the plant cool down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital B electrical trains allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> the protective relay per design and should not have caused unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the unit would have remained online.|$|R

40|$|If I {{were to ask}} you to {{reel off}} a list of names of those that you feel have had the {{greatest}} influence on language teaching and learning over, say, the last century, there is one name that would more often than not be conspicuous by its absence. Earl Stevick may not be the first name <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> <b>off</b> the tongue, but his life’s work has nonetheless had considerable influence on our profession. On top of a career that saw him undertake pioneering teaching work in Africa, as well as being a key player in developing the communicative approach (and learning fourteen languages along the way), Stevick published four groundbreaking books which addressed the significance of the human being in the process language learning and acquisition. One of these, ‘Success with Foreign Languages: seven who achieved it and what worked for them’ was based on research investigating the factors which led to the success of learners in acquiring a second language. Published way back in the 1980 s, this title saw Stevick placing his research subjects into different learning categories according to their preferred learning environment. While three decades have passed since its publication, and with consideration of the changes that have occurred in education in that time, what I’d like to do in this article is to show that Stevick’s categories are still as relevant today as they were when first published. Furthermore, I will propose a list of strategies for catering to Stevick’s learner categories in the contemporary classroom. ...|$|E
3000|$|According to the Figs. 5, 6, {{the adversary}} is {{always able to}} drive the {{frequency}} deviation wherever the attack signals dictate. We highlight that the input saturation constraints are never triggered and that after the steady-state is reached, the produced powers Δ P_G,i satisfy both the power load demands {{and the increase in}} the network frequency. Although the persistent nature of the attack does not cause any power oscillations on the tie line, the steady-state errors in the frequency deviation are critical for the stability of the grid and may lead the power relays <b>to</b> <b>trip</b> the generators <b>off,</b> thus causing a blackout. Furthermore, we observe that the adversary can remain undetectable as long as the attack signals retain relatively small values. In particular, for α _ 1 = α _ 2 = 2 [...] Hz the adversary is ultimately disclosed but for α _ 1 = α _ 2 = 1 [...] Hz the attack is stealthy.|$|R
