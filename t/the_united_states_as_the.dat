5|$|The Methodist {{movement}} was growing rapidly in pre-Civil War America, but was beset by disputes about slave-holding {{and the rule}} over the church by bishops, resulting in a formal split into two groups in 1844.

Those in opposition formed the Methodist Protestant Church in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> impending Civil War loomed over {{the nation in the}} 1850s, local Towson Methodists continued to worship together at Epsom Chapel.|$|E

From 1823 to 1828, he was the commandant of Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, which was followed by a posting from 1829 to 1835, as Superintendent of Fernando Po off the coast of Africa. In 1835, Nicolls retired from the Royal Marines with the rank of a lieutenant colonel. For his service, Nicolls was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, among other honours, and was promoted to the rank of full general in his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without sufficient personnel to man many of its ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, many of them were sold to foreign nations. This left <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E

5|$|The Hawker Siddeley Harrier, {{developed}} in the 1960s, {{was the first of}} the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft. It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s.

5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around the world.

However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E
