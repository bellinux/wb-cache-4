25|$|A {{decision-maker}} acts in an {{ultra vires}} manner {{when it did}} not have the power that it purported to have, and therefore there was no basis in law for the impugned action. In Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), the court held that the Corporation was only empowered by statute to provide washing facilities for the residents <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> clothes adequately. Hence, a laundry service implemented by the Corporation was ultra vires.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} hand-washing in the health-care setting {{is to remove}} {{pathogenic}} microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them. The New England Journal of Medicine reports {{that a lack of}} hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands before touching patients. One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.|$|E

50|$|Avoiding food {{or water}} that may be {{contaminated}} with stool can help prevent the infection of Cystoisospora (Isosporiasis). Good hand-washing, and personal-hygiene practices should be used as well. One should <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands with soap and warm water after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food (CDC.gov). It {{is also important to}} teach children the importance of <b>washing</b> <b>their</b> hands, and how <b>to</b> properly <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands.|$|R
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that if, in the land, they found the body of a murder victim lying in the open, and they could not determine the killer, then the elders and judges were to measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns. The elders of the nearest town were to take a heifer that had never worked down to an ever-flowing wadi and break its neck. The priests were to come forward, and all the elders were <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands over the heifer.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of Asia, people {{traditionally}} use the toilet in a squatting position. This applies to defecation and urination by males and females. Therefore, homes and public washrooms have squat toilets, with the toilet bowl installed in the floor. This has the advantages of not needing an additional toilet seat and also being more convenient for cultures where people use water <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> genitals instead of toilet paper. However, Western-style toilets that are mounted at sitting height and which have a plastic seat have become popular as well. Many public washrooms have both squatting and sitting toilets.|$|E
25|$|Historical examples, {{such as the}} {{hookworm}} {{campaigns in}} Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 {{have shown that the}} primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children {{do not have access to}} clean water <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.|$|E

25|$|In 1847, Hungarian {{physician}} Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis dramatically {{reduced the}} occurrency of puerperal fever by simply requiring physicians <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands before attending {{to women in}} childbirth. This discovery predated the germ theory of disease. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister, who in 1865 proved the principles of antisepsis. Lister's work {{was based on the}} important findings by French biologist Louis Pasteur. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised {{one of the most important}} methods in preventive medicine, when in 1880 he produced a vaccine against rabies. Pasteur invented the process of pasteurization, to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.|$|E
25|$|Although {{patients}} are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections {{are due to}} naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own gastrointestinal tract (including oral cavity) and skin. This may manifest as systemic infections, such as sepsis, or as localized outbreaks, such as Herpes simplex, shingles, or {{other members of the}} Herpesviridea. The risk of illness and death can be reduced by taking common antibiotics such as quinolones or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole before any fever or sign of infection appears. For every five people who are immunosuppressed following chemotherapy who take an antibiotic, one fever can be prevented; for every 34 who take an antibiotic, one death can be prevented. Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.|$|E

25|$|According to Leviticus, {{anyone who}} comes {{into contact with}} or carries any {{creature}} that hadn't been deliberately killed by shechita was regarded by the biblical regulations as having made themselves unclean by doing so, and therefore was compelled to immerse their entire body. This regulation is immediately preceded by the rule against eating anything still containing blood, and according to biblical scholars {{this is also the}} context of the regulation about not eating non-sacrifices - that the regulation only treats such consumption as unclean if there is a risk of blood still remaining within the carcass. In the version of this regulation in Deuteronomy, eating the bodies of such creatures isn't described as making an individual ritually impure, nor requires the eater <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> body, but instead such consumption is expressly forbidden, although the creature is allowed to be passed on to a stranger, who is permitted to eat it.|$|E
25|$|After {{the conquest}} of the city, in 1462 Sultan Mehmet II (r. 1444–1446; 1451–1481) {{fortified}} the harbour, now known as Kadırga Limanı ("Harbour of the Galleys"), building several towers. However, {{the beginning of the}} construction in 1515 of a new arsenal on the Golden Horn, the Tersâne-i Âmire, protected from the storms provoked by the southwest wind, and the enormous growth of the Ottoman navy, caused the decay of the Kadırga Limanı. The 16th-century French traveller Pierre Gilles reports that around 1540 the women living in that neighbourhood used <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> clothes in the basin. However, in some 18th-century maps, the harbour is still shown in active use. The end of the port was accelerated by the erection of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque, started in 1748, since the excavated earth was partly thrown in the harbour. The basin and the arsenal have since long time disappeared, and today they are partly built up.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican Spanish word “paste” (pronounced PAH-steh) {{come from}} the Cornish word pasties, which is {{basically}} a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made {{a good way to}} bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as there was no way <b>to</b> <b>wash</b> <b>their</b> hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken “tinga,” pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.|$|E

The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean.

This changed the tempo of battle, as the Dutch commanders halted the advance to deliberate their next steps. They decided to climb the Guia Hill, upon which a hermitage was situated, to get a better view of the enemy, but their ascent was resisted by a party of 30 Macanese and blacks, whose ferocity and effective use of terrain forced the Dutch to back down and change their plans again. Not expecting such stiff resistance, the invaders moved toward a patch of high ground near the Guia Hill, with the intention of retreating for the day due to fatigue and low ammunitions (most were lost in the explosion).|$|E
