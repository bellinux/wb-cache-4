25|$|Debra (née Whelan) Barone (Patricia Heaton) is Raymond's wife, {{and mother}} of Ally, Michael and Geoffrey. As a housewife, Debra claims she is {{frequently}} overworked, under-appreciated and stressed out. This leads to her yelling, largely because she has <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> the housework and her three rambunctious children with almost no assistance or support from Raymond; she constantly puts up with Marie's intrusiveness and criticism. On frequent occasions this frustration boils over and is vented towards Raymond. While Debra has a fractious relationship with Marie, she is shown to be fond of her in-laws on many occasions – particularly brother-in-law Robert.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

25|$|By 1916, Einstein {{was able}} to generalize this further, <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> states of motion {{including}} non-uniform acceleration, which became {{the general theory of}} relativity. In this theory Einstein also specified a new concept, the curvature of space-time, which described the gravitational effect at every point in space. In fact, the curvature of space-time completely replaced Newton's universal law of gravitation. According to Einstein, gravitational force in the normal sense is a kind of illusion caused by the geometry of space. The presence of a mass causes a curvature of space-time {{in the vicinity of the}} mass, and this curvature dictates the space-time path that all freely-moving objects must follow. It was also predicted from this theory that light should be subject to gravity - all of which was verified experimentally. This aspect of relativity explained the phenomena of light bending around the sun, predicted black holes as well as properties of the Cosmic microwave background radiation — a discovery rendering fundamental anomalies in the classic Steady-State hypothesis. For his work on relativity, the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921.|$|E

Those genes function in the immune system (Hooper et al., 2012), with good reason: pathogens, an important part being bacteria, were one of the largest forces shaping the evolution of human genomes and thus the survival of our species and other species that rely on the immune system to defend against those pathogens (Kau et al., 2011).|$|R
