5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>parental</b> magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E

5|$|Another {{widespread}} trait among modern birds is {{parental care}} for young after hatching. Jack Horner's 1978 {{discovery of a}} Maiasaura ("good mother lizard") nesting ground in Montana demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>parental</b> care continued long after birth among ornithopods, suggesting this behavior might also have been common to all dinosaurs. There is evidence that other non-theropod dinosaurs, like Patagonian titanosaurian sauropods, also nested in large groups. A specimen of the Mongolian oviraptorid Citipati osmolskae was discovered in a chicken-like brooding position in 1993, which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm. Parental care being a trait common to all dinosaurs is supported by other finds. For example, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the prosauropod Massospondylus) was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs. Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the Isle of Skye in northwestern Scotland. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that all dinosaurs cared for their young to some extent either before or shortly after hatching.|$|E

500|$|Divorce is {{difficult}} on all parties {{involved in the}} process, including the children. Due to the stressful nature of divorce, along with inherent issues {{on the amount of}} time the children can spend with each parent, the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children. Unless the children's parents are often involved in intense conflict, or one of the parents is abusive and/or mentally ill, the children tend to fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement. Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements, the children tend to exhibit better relationships with their families, better performance in their schools, higher levels of self-esteem, and fewer conduct and emotional issues. Further, it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children (or rather children who do not have divorced parents), where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children. However, joint physical custody with an even division of time is not always necessary. These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents. According to Robert Emery, a divorce mediation expert, [...] "In many ways, joint physical custody is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents very much involved in their lives." [...] This statement has been supported by psychological data. [...] Speculation <b>that</b> <b>parental</b> conflict erases the benefits of joint physical custody have not been supported by empirical research. A 2017 paper appearing in a journal published by the American Psychological Association analyzed every study that included measures and controls for conflict when comparing joint and sole physical custody families. Conflict was neither more nor less damaging for children in joint physical custody than those in sole custody. Of 16 studies that controlled for conflict when measuring children’s adjustment, only one reported worse adjustment in joint physical custody. One study found that boys did better and girls worse. Fourteen studies reported either better outcomes in joint physical custody or no differences, even after taking conflict into account.|$|E
