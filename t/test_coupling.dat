40|$|Metamaterial {{designs are}} {{typically}} {{limited to a}} narrow operating bandwidth that is predetermined by the fabricated dimensions. Various approaches have previously been used to introduce post-fabrication tunability and thus enable active metamaterials. In this work, we exploit the mechanical deformability of a highly compliant polymeric substrate to achieve dynamic, tunable resonant frequency shifts greater than a resonant linewidth. We investigate the effect of metamaterial shape on the plastic deformation limit of resonators. We find that, for designs in which the local strain is evenly distributed, the response is elastic under larger global tensile strains. The plastic and elastic limits of resonator deformation are explored and the results indicate that, once deformed, the resonators operate within a new envelope of elastic response. We also demonstrate the use of coupled resonator systems to add an additional degree of freedom to the frequency tunability and show that compliant substrates {{can be used as}} a tool to <b>test</b> <b>coupling</b> strength. Finally, we illustrate how compliant metamaterials could be used as infrared sensors, and show enhancement of an infrared vibration absorption feature by a factor of 225. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Beams with {{coupling}} force {{have been designed}} as conventional flexure members with stirrups and with some shear resistance allocated to the concrete are oftentimes will inevitably fail specially at diagonal areas, hence for beams with {{coupling force}} is recommended that the beams are reinforced with diagonal systems (bi-diagonal reinforcement). Six object <b>test</b> <b>coupling</b> beams 400 x 300 x 150 mm have been tested to aim the target, which is to know the behavior characteristic of deformation and mode of failure, to know the placement influence of diagonal reinforcement at coupling beams. Result of research indicate that behavior characteristic of deformation and mode of failure at coupling beams that happened is the existence of compression area at diagonal direction coming in contact with tip of force, tension area at opposite diagonal direction which will have crack till split at diagonal area compress, and the beam will attain its maximum load carrying capacity when {{small portion of the}} concrete in the compression corners crush. The proposed method of analysis of reinforced concrete coupling beams based on the equilibrium of forces of triangular half of the beam at failure gives a satisfactory prediction the distribution of force in the main bars. The behavior of coupling beams in shear (diagonal splitting) mode of failure is represented in mathematical model.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} shear {{walls are}} frequently used in multi-storey buildings exposed to high lateral loading originating from wind or seismic disturbances {{because of their}} high in-plane stiffness. The shear walls are usually pierced {{by a number of}} openings dividing them into individual solid walls, which are normally interconnected by strong coupling beams. The beams usually span over short distances and are relatively deep. In the seismic design of tall buildings, in order for a coupled shear wall structure to develop full strength and exhibit ductile behaviour, it is of primary importance that coupling beams possess the considerable ability to deform plastically. An accurate prediction of both ultimate strength and ductility capacity is required. The work in this thesis covers an experimental programme and the theoretical development for shear capacity of deep steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) coupling beams. Experimental study is first conducted to study the behaviour and shear strength (both ultimate and post-cracking) of the deep SFRC coupling beams under both monotonic and reversed-cyclic loads, respectively. A new experimental rig to <b>test</b> <b>coupling</b> beams been proposed, where a very unique feature is that the loading is applied with simple force paths to the beams through the rotation of the walls. The span-to-depth ratio of specimens can be adjusted in a wide range by changing the span rather than the depth of the beam. This allows a direct comparison of results of different specimens without considering the size effect. The loading frame restraints the horizontal deformation of the beam, thus modelling the behaviour of a real coupling beam restrained by the floor slabs in buildings. In the test programme, fourteen large-scale coupling beam specimens are constructed, where seven are tested under monotonic loading while the other are tested under reversed cyclic loading. The important variables in the tests include the concrete matrix used (i. e. steel fibre concrete or pure concrete), span-to-depth ratios of the beams and ratios of transverse steel reinforcement. All fourteen specimens tested failed in a brittle shear manner; however the strength drop is less severe {{in the case of the}} steel fibre reinforced specimens. The test results show the significant improvement in the post-peak behaviour of the coupling beams after the addition of steel fibres (by as much as 50 %). It has also been shown that the ultimate shear strengths of the specimens tested are much higher than those predicted by the current codes of practice including BS 8110 and Eurocode 2. An analytical model has been developed. The model uses the principles of solid mechanics, fracture mechanics as well as the 1 st and 2 nd laws of thermodynamics (i. e. energy methods). The proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the ultimate shear capacity and load-displacement behaviour of reinforced concrete and fibre reinforced concrete deep beams. The steel fibre contribution is considered as a concrete property (i. e. tensile strength) and is assumed plastic. The model of concrete softening is based on the model empirically developed and implemented in the Modified Compression Field Theory. A series of analyses has been carried out for comparing the results of the proposed model with those obtained from a wide range of experimental work on reinforced concrete and fibre reinforced concrete deep beams. The results show a very good agreement. It has been shown that the proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the shear capacity and load-displacement behaviour of both reinforced concrete and fibre reinforced concrete deep beams...|$|E

We aimed to determine whether providing multiple HIV self-tests to pregnant and postpartum women for secondary distribution is more effective at promoting partner <b>testing</b> and <b>couples</b> <b>testing</b> than conventional strategies based on invitations to clinic-based testing. We conducted a randomized trial in Kisumu, Kenya, between June 11, 2015, and January 15, 2016. Six hundred antenatal and postpartum women aged 18 - 39 y were randomized to an HIV self-testing (HIVST) group or a comparison group. Participants in the HIVST group were given two oral-fluid-based HIV test kits, instructed on how to use them, and encouraged to distribute a test kit to their male partner or use both kits for <b>testing</b> as a <b>couple.</b> Participants in the comparison group were given an invitation card for clinic-based HIV testing and encouraged to distribute the card to their male partner, a routine practice in many health clinics. The primary outcome was partner testing within 3 mo of enrollment. Among 570 participants analyzed, partner HIV testing was more likely in the HIVST group (90. 8 %, 258 / 284) than the comparison group (51. 7 %, 148 / 286; difference = 39. 1 %, 95 % CI 32. 4 % to 45. 8 %, p < 0. 001). <b>Couples</b> <b>testing</b> was also more likely in the HIVST group than the comparison group (75. 4 % versus 33. 2 %, difference = 42. 1 %, 95 % CI 34. 7 % to 49. 6 %, p < 0. 001). No participants reported intimate partner violence due to HIV testing.

S-HVOF coatings were nanostructured and deposited via an aqueous based {{suspension of the}} WC-Co powder, using modified HVOF (TopGun) spraying. Microstructural evaluations of these hardmetal coatings included X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). Sliding wear tests on coatings were conducted using a ball-on-flat test rig against steel, silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) ceramic and WC- 6 Co balls. Results indicated that nanosized particles inherited from the starting powder in S-HVOF spraying were retained in the resulting coatings. Significant changes in the chemical and phase composition were observed in the S-HVOF coatings. Despite decarburization, the hardness and sliding wear resistance of the S-HVOF coatings was comparable to the HVOF-JK and HVOF-JP coatings. The sliding wear performance was dependent on the ball-coating <b>test</b> <b>couple.</b> In general a higher ball wear rate was observed with lower coating wear rate. Comparison of the total (ball and coating) wear rate indicated that for steel and ceramic balls, HVOF-JP coatings performed the best followed by the S-HVOF and HVOF-JK coatings. For the WC-Co ball tests, average performance of S-HVOF was better than that of HVOF-JK and HVOF-JP coatings. Changes in sliding wear behavior were attributed to the support of metal matrix due to relatively higher tungsten content, and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the S-HVOF coating microstructure.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Male partner {{involvement}} {{has been}} recognized as {{an important component of}} prevention-of-mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT); however, male antenatal attendance has been difficult to achieve. Home-based <b>testing</b> among pregnant <b>couples</b> may be an effective strategy to test men. Women attending their first antenatal visit at Kisumu District Hospital in Kenya were screened for eligibility and randomized to home-based education and HIV testing (HOPE) or to written invitations for male partners to attend clinic (INVITE).
