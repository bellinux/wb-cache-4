The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|BZP {{has been}} shown to have a mixed {{mechanism}} of action, acting on the serotonergic and dopaminergic receptor systems in a similar fashion to MDMA. BZP has amphetamine-like actions on the serotonin reuptake <b>transporter,</b> which increase serotonin concentrations in the extracellular fluids surrounding the cell and thereby increasing activation of the surrounding serotonin receptors. BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake <b>transporter</b> and the dopamine reuptake <b>transporter.</b> BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E

For the redesign Michelson felt that the <b>transporter</b> should look and feel more powerful. He added a sealed control room that would protect operators from the powerful forces at work. The space between the <b>transporter</b> platform and the operators was filled with complex machinery, and cinematographer Richard Kline added eerie lighting to the set to create atmosphere.|$|E

30|$|Membrane <b>transporters</b> are the gatekeepers for all {{cells and}} organelles, {{controlling}} uptake and efflux of crucial compounds such as sugars, nucleotides, inorganic ions, and drugs (Hediger et al. 2004). They {{are responsible for}} substrate movement across both cytoplasmic membranes of cells and internal membranes of organelles (Sreedharan et al. 2011). <b>Transporters</b> {{can be divided into}} ABC <b>transporters,</b> pumps, ion channels, water channels, and solute carriers. Membrane bound proteins represent about 27 % of the entire human proteome. Among the membrane bound proteins, the SLC <b>transporters</b> are the second largest group after G protein coupled receptors (Lagerstrom 2008 Almen et al. 2009). <b>Transporters</b> can be divided into two families, passive and active <b>transporters.</b> The active <b>transporters</b> use diverse energy-coupling mechanisms to allow the movement of molecules across a membrane against a concentration gradient. The passive <b>transporters,</b> also known as facilitated <b>transporters,</b> allow passage of solutes (e.g., glucose, amino acids, urea) across membranes down their electrochemical gradients (Hediger et al. 2004).|$|R

With command functions enabled, Picard is able to activate a <b>transporter</b> safety function.

5|$|By August 9, the {{production}} {{was already a}} full day behind schedule. Despite the delays, Wise refused to shoot more than twelve hours on set, feeling he lost his edge afterwards. The director was patient on set; bets were placed on when he would finally lose his temper, but pool organizers returned the money when Wise never lost his cool. Given his unfamiliarity with the source material Wise relied on the actors, especially Shatner, to help ensure that dialog and characterizations {{were consistent with the}} show. While the bridge scenes were shot early, trouble with filming the <b>transporter</b> room scene delayed further work. Crew working on the <b>transporter</b> platform found their footwear melting on the lighted grid while shooting tests. Issues with the wormhole sequences caused further delays. The footage for the scene was filmed two ways; first, at the standard 24frames per second, and then at the faster 48frames; the normal footage was a back-up if the slow-motion effect produced by the faster frame speed did not turned out as planned. The shoot dragged on so long that it became a running joke for cast members to try and top each other with wormhole-related puns. The scene was finally completed on August 24, while the <b>transporter</b> scenes were being filmed at the same time on the same soundstage.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A <b>transporter</b> protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane <b>transporter</b> 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
