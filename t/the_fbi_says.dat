Federal investigators attributed these attempts to Russian government-sponsored hackers, and specifically to Russian intelligence agencies. Four of the intrusions into voter registration databases were successful, including intrusions into the Illinois and Arizona databases. Although the hackers {{did not appear to}} change or manipulate data, Illinois officials reported that information on up to 200,000 registered voters was stolen. [...] <b>The</b> <b>FBI</b> and DHS increased their election-security coordination efforts with state officials as a result. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reported that 18 states had requested voting-system security assistance from DHS.

2500|$|The Illinois House and Senate {{moved quickly}} {{thereafter}} to impeach the governor for {{abuse of power}} and corruption. On January 8, the Illinois House voted 114–1 (with three abstentions) to impeach Blagojevich. The charges brought by the House emphasized Blagojevich's alleged abuses of power and his alleged attempts to sell gubernatorial appointments and legislative authorizations and/or vetoes. One of the accusations was an alleged attempt to sell the appointment to the United States Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Barack Obama. Blagojevich was taped by <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "I've got this thing, and it's fucking golden. I'm just not giving it up for fucking nothing." [...] He was removed from office and prohibited from ever holding public office {{in the state of}} Illinois again, by two separate and unanimous votes of 59–0 by the Illinois Senate on January 29, 2009. Blagojevich's lieutenant governor Patrick Quinn subsequently became governor of Illinois. Blagojevich's impeachment trial and removal from office did not have any effect or bearing on his federal indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, as impeachment is a political, not a criminal, sanction.|$|R

Concerned by it, Brian and Stewie get to Paris themselves {{to take matters into}} their own hands and save Meg. They find out where the men took Meg, who is about to be sold as a sex slave. At the auction, Stewie dresses up as a slave and Brian dresses as an Arab to get in, and Stewie is sold to Brian (for $500,000). However, Brian cannot afford to pay for Stewie, and the guard uncovers their disguises. They are chained to a pipe downstairs, but Brian breaks free and overpowers the guard. They then follow Meg and her captors to a yacht traveling down the River Seine. On board, Meg is delivered to an Arab emir waiting in the master stateroom. After Meg refuses to be his sex slave, the emir reveals he bought her not to be a sex slave but to be his son's wife. The king introduces his teenage son, the young prince of the kingdom, who calls Meg a [...] "goddess" [...] and asks her to marry him or if she declines he will have her flown back to America on their private jet. Meg agrees to marry him, but Stewie then kills the prince, uses a neuralizer on Meg, and takes her to a French hospital for treatment before taking her home safely.|$|R

In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> and <b>the</b> CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> and CIA, <b>saying</b> [...] "We're very interested in the fact that <b>the</b> <b>FBI's</b> so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we {{knew we were going to}} go to one timeline, because it’s about the terrorist event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|R
