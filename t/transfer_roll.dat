40|$|EP 1568473 A UPAB: 20051024 NOVELTY - Polymer {{impregnated}} fibers(4) are wound {{with a set}} orientation onto mandrels(16) of {{an auxiliary}} tool(8). The wound fibers are then stripped from the mandrels as they are placed into an open two-part molding tool(21) and the tool is closed to apply pressure and consolidate the molding. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Fibers(4) are wound spool-like onto the mandrels as the auxiliary tool is moved by a handling system(14). Some {{or all of the}} winding mandrels move relative to each other depending on the required fiber orientation. Wound fibers are heated by hot gas, in particular hot air, or electrical radiation, especially infra-red. Fiber are guided over a heated <b>transfer</b> <b>roll</b> (9) during winding. The <b>transfer</b> <b>roll</b> may be swiveled around an axis extending in the fiber direction.

In this way, it is possible to distinguish between the road disturbance component and the vehicle’s roll angle. The controller’s effectiveness has been tested by means of simulations carried out in TruckSim, using an experimentally-validated vehicle model. Lateral load <b>transfer,</b> <b>roll</b> angle, yaw rate and sideslip angle have been analyzed in order to quantify the improvements achieved on the behavior of the vehicle.

Despite increasing calls {{to do the}} same for working age people with disabilities in the U.

In contrast to the failure to reform United States disability policy, the Netherlands, once considered to have the most out of control disability program among OECD nations, initiated reforms in 2002 that have dramatically reduced their disability cash <b>transfer</b> <b>rolls,</b> while maintaining a strong but less generous social minimum safety net for all those who do not work.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{cooperative}} effort was to evaluate the potential of Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys, such as IC 221 M and IC 396 M, for use as transfer rolls in heating treating furnaces and slab reheating furnaces used during the normal hot processing of steel ingots into rolled products. Rolls consist of three parts: the center tube section which forms the roll surface {{in direct contact with}} the steel, and the sections welded {{at each end of the}} tube, called trunnions, which bear the load. The work in this CRADA focused on weldments and base materials. The transfer rolls in the furnaces used in the hot processing of steel have been made, almost exclusively, from iron-chromium-nickel heat resistant alloys for over 35 years. The iron-based heat resistant alloys experience a variety of problems when exposed to temperatures above 760 C including: cracking, dimensional instability, and excessive oxidation. Many defects in rolled steel products can be traced directly to rolls used in the processing. Also the demand for higher quality products, spurred in part by competition from foreign producers, requires that various avenues for improving overall quality of rolled steel products be pursued. Initial work done by the Contractor and Metallamics indicated that Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys may perform better than existing iron-chromium-nickel alloys do as transfer rolls in heat treating furnaces. The use of Ni{sub 3 }Al may lead to rolls with longer operational life, improved high temperature oxidation resistance and mechanical properties, higher quality rolled steel products, and improved energy and operational efficiencies in the hot processing of steel. The goal of the work was to test Ni{sub 3 }Al alloys for the <b>transfer</b> <b>roll</b> application in order to improve process efficiency, minimize waste by virtue of producing rolled steel of higher quality and to enhance the competitiveness of US-based steel producers...|$|E

40|$|Papyrus was {{the most}} {{important}} writing material in ancient times. Before papyrus tablets which made of pats and pans, plain stones, cushion, bronz, zinc, cuppor, silver or gold were used to write on. Besides these, writing materials which were made of plant roots and leaves, wooden tablets which were smeared with wax, tablets made of ivory and organic writing materials made of flax stem were used, too. However, none of these were essentials, influential or permanent like papyrus. Papyrus was first used in Ancient Egypt in 3300 s BC. Later, spreading over all Mediterranean countries, it became the most popular writing material. Papyrus remained valuable until XI century AD. Papyrus existed in several kind, different colour and several type of quality according to its whiteness, thickness, dimensionand polish. Papyrus used to be sold in different prices according to its praperties such as its lenght, quality etc. Papyrus was called in various names according to its thickness, width, colour and usage. These names reflected papyrus’s quality and price. They also reflected the area they were used. On the papyrus, scientific and literary articles such as mathematical calculations, astronomy, medical texts, magical words, religions texts, lists of kings, list of geographical places, list of cities, course boooks, mytological writings, adventure stories and articles of geography were written.

40|$|Iron {{aluminides}} {{have been}} among the most studied intermetallics since the 1930 s, when their excellent oxidation resistance was first noticed. Their low cost of production, low density, high strength-to-weight ratios, good wear resistance, ease of fabrication and resistance to high temperature oxidation and sulfurization make them very attractive as a substitute for routine stainless steel in industrial applications. Furthermore, iron aluminides allow for the conservation of less accessible and expensive elements such as nickel and molybdenum. These advantages have led to the consideration of many applications, such as brake disks for windmills and trucks, filtration systems in refineries and fossil power plants, <b>transfer</b> <b>rolls</b> for hot-rolled steel strips, and ethylene crackers and air deflectors for burning high-sulfur coal. A wide application for iron aluminides in industry strictly depends on the fundamental understanding of the influence of (i) alloy composition; (ii) microstructure; and (iii) number (type) of defects on the thermo-mechanical properties. Additionally, environmental degradation of the alloys, consisting of hydrogen embrittlement, anodic or cathodic dissolution, localized corrosion and oxidation resistance, in different environments should be well known. Recently, some progress in the development of new micro- and nano-mechanical testing methods in addition to the fabrication techniques of micro- and nano-scaled samples has enabled scientists to resolve more clearly the effects of alloying elements, environmental items and crystal structure on the deformation behavior of alloys. In this paper, we will review the extensive work which has been done during the last decades to address each of the points mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is significative to {{link the}} {{semi-solid}} process and continuous roll-casting process (CRP), through which we can get high quality magnesium alloy strips with non-dendritic structure and improve the overall properties of the products. Furthermore, because CRP of semi-solid metal combines casting and forming, it shortens the period of technological process. In general, several technical parameters such as the inlet temperature of semi-solid slurry, the heat <b>transfer</b> between <b>roll</b> and molten alloy, the roll-casting speed, the position of solidification final point influence on the strip quality in continuous roll-casting process. Therefore, {{the effects of the}} parameter to continuous roll-casting process should be investigated. In this paper, the finite volume method is used in the analysis of the CRP, a two-dimensional incompressible non-Newtonian flow with heat transfer is considered. Based on the simulated results, the optimizational technical parameters are obtained and the experiment of CRP was carried out. An ideal AZ 91 D strip with non-dendritic structure has been obtained and also has been tested by cold rolling and hot rolling.

40|$|International audienceA {{temperature}} sensor with a thermocouple placed at ~ 0. 5 mm from roll surface {{is used in}} hot rolling conditions to evaluate by inverse calculation heat <b>transfers</b> in the <b>roll</b> bite. Simulation analysis under industrial hot rolling conditions with short contact lengths (e. g. short contact times) and high rolling speeds (7 m. /s) show that the {{temperature sensor}} + inverse analysis with a high acquisition frequency (> 1000 Hz) is capable to predict accurately (5 to 10 % error) the roll bite peak of temperature. However as heat flux is more sensitive to noise measurement, the peak of heat flux in the bite is under-estimated (20 % error) by the inverse calculation and thus the average roll bite heat flux is also interesting information from the sensor (these simulation results will be verified with an industrial trial that is being prepared). Rolling tests on a pilot mill with low rolling speeds (from 0. 3 to 1. 5 m. /s) and strip reductions varying from 10 to 40 % have been performed with the temperature sensor. Analysis of the tests by inverse calculation show that at low speed (< 0. 5 m. /sec.) and large contact lengths (reduction: 30 to 40 %), the roll bite peak of heat flux reconstructed by inverse calculation is correct. At higher speeds (1. 5 m. /sec.) and smaller contact lengths (reduction : 10 20 %), the reconstruction is incorrect: heat flux peak in the bite is under-estimated by the inverse calculation though its average value is correct. The analysis reveals also that the Heat Transfer Coefficient HTCroll-bite (characterizing heat <b>transfers</b> between <b>roll</b> and strip in the bite) is not uniform along the roll bite but {{is proportional to the}} local rolling pressure. Finally, based on the above results, simulations with a roll thermal fatigue degradation model under industrial hot rolling conditions show that the non-uniform <b>roll</b> bite Heat <b>Transfer</b> Coefficient HTCroll-bite may have under certain rolling conditions a stronger influence on roll thermal fatigue degradation than the equivalent (e. g. same average) HTCroll-bite taken uniform along the bite.
