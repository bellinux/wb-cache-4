5|$|Susan meets Jim Dolan at the {{hospital}} and she asks him to talk about the Patient Advocacy Program for a news article. Jim reveals that he has cancer and Susan supports him during his treatments. Malcolm comes to visit his parents and detects all is not well between them. Susan becomes worried when Jim does not answer her calls and Karl confesses that he asked Jim to keep his distance, which angers Susan. She accuses Karl of being jealous. Karl invites Jim over for lunch and he notices the map and leaflets for Peru. Jim works out Susan is delaying the holiday for him. He then collapses and Susan begs Karl to save him. Susan comforts Jim when he realises he is going to die and she tries <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of {{the hospital}}, so they can visit his childhood home, as promised. Karl stops her and when they step outside to talk, Jim dies. Susan is devastated and blames Karl for keeping her from Jim. She then leaves to arrange Jim's funeral. On her return, Susan and Karl announce that they are separating. Malcolm initially blames Susan for the split, but Karl confesses it was his idea.

25|$|Captain George Walling of the Metropolitans was {{assigned}} to carry {{out one of the}} warrants. He arrived at City Hall by himself and was allowed to speak with Mayor Wood in his private office. Learning the purpose of his visit, Wood refused to accompany Walling, who then attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the building by force. Over 300 Municipal officers were stationed at City Hall, and Walling was stopped and thrown out into the street. He attempted several times to re-enter, arguing with Captain Abraham Ackerman, until the arrival of Captains Jacob Sebring and Coroner Perry, leading fifty Metropolitans, to serve the second warrant.|$|E
25|$|The {{other basic}} {{defensive}} play {{is called the}} bump or ride-off. It's similar to a body check in hockey. In a ride-off, a player rides his pony alongside an opponent's mount {{in order to move}} an opponent away from the ball or <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of a play. It must be executed properly so that it does not endanger the horses or the players. The angle of contact must be safe and can not knock the horses off balance, or harm the horses in any way. Two players following the line of the ball and riding one another off have the right of way over a single man coming from any direction.|$|E

25|$|The {{kidnapping}} problems, however, {{have been}} replaced with violence related to the drug trade, {{despite the fact that}} Morelos is far from the U.S. border. The 2009 slaying of kingpin Arturo Beltrán Leyva set of a turf war for his successor. It has increased the number of gun battles and gangland-style executions. Anonymous email threats succeed in keeping people away from Cuernavaca at night, with bars and nightclubs closing when such communications threaten drug violence. In 2004, Governor Sergio Estrada ordered the mass firing of all of the state police officers after top police commanders were arrested on charges that they were working with drug traffickers. This caused a major political battle for the governor, who then himself was accused of coperating with drug rings, with attempts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of office. The area around Lagunas de Zempoala National Park, on Morelos's border with Mexico City, is one of Mexico's 16 most dangerous regions, in part due to the narcotics trade.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1915, Bob Ashley {{attempted}} {{to break his}} brother John out of jail. Entering the jailer's house, Bob Ashley shot Deputy Sheriff Wilber W. Hendrickson at point-blank range and left with his jail keys. He then ran from {{the house to the}} garage where gang members had left him a getaway car. When he found he was unable to drive the particular car left for him, he {{attempted to}} force several men at gunpoint to drive the car for him. Each of the men claimed to not know how to drive the car either so Bob Ashley jumped on the running board of a passing truck and forced the driver, T.H. Duckett, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of town. A deputy, officer J.R. Riblet, spotted Ashley and gave chase. When the truck suddenly stalled {{in the middle of the}} street, a shootout occurred resulting in the deaths of both Bob Ashley and Riblet. Angered by Bob's killing spree, several thousand Miami residents threatened the jailhouse and talked of lynching John Ashley in his cell. It was only after police paraded the body of Bob Ashley though the streets that the mob dispersed.|$|E
25|$|Six {{days after}} North Carolina avenged their earlier loss at Duke in February with a 90-83 {{victory at the}} Dean Dome, the two teams would face off in the semifinals of the ACC Tournament, this time in Brooklyn, New York in the Barclays Center. This game was only the fifth time that Duke and North Carolina had played each other outside {{of the state of}} North Carolina. North Carolina {{controlled}} the first half by outscoring Duke in the paint 32-10, with North Carolina's Kennedy Meeks leading the charge. North Carolina led by as many as 13 points and threatened to turn the game into a blowout, but Duke's Grayson Allen made four 3-pointers to get Duke within 7 points at the half, with North Carolina leading 49-42. In the second half, with North Carolina leading Duke 56-48 with 15:04 left, North Carolina's Joel Berry II picked up his fourth foul, which forced North Carolina <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the game. Though North Carolina led by 13 points at 61-48 with 13:53 remaining, Duke used a 20-4 run over the next five minutes, thanks to steals and three-pointers from Duke's Jayson Tatum and Luke Kennard, to put Duke up 68-65 over North Carolina with 8:24 left. Duke then pulled away and won 93-83 to complete a 45-22 run over North Carolina in the final 14 minutes of the game.|$|E

25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} the game Banks and England's hopes of making further inroads into the World Cup were dented {{when he started to}} {{complain}} of an upset stomach. He became affected by violent stomach cramps and aching limbs, and spent his time in the bathroom sweating, shivering and vomiting. He passed an extremely undemanding fitness test but suffered a relapse shortly before the game and Ramsey was forced to rest him in place of Peter Bonetti. Ramsey remarked that [...] "of all the players to lose, we had to lose him." [...] Banks watched the game on television at the hotel as England lost a two-goal lead to be eliminated 3–2 after extra time; due to a time delay on the broadcast he switched the television off with England 2–0 in the lead as Bobby Moore returned to the hotel to break the news of the defeat. Conspiracies later surfaced that Banks had been poisoned <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the game, but with no evidence to support them Banks never believed in these conspiracies.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1943, Kennedy {{signed a}} {{professional}} {{contract with the}} Toronto Maple Leafs, but management of the Leafs still wished to see Kennedy playing in an NHL game. Late in the 1942–43 season, they received permission from Kennedy's mother <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of school so he could accompany them on a road trip. He played {{in two of the}} final three games of the regular season, but did not continue with them into the playoffs. Making his NHL debut March 7, 1943, against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, he was put on the Leafs' third line on rightwing, instead of his customary centre position, on a line with Bud Poile and Gaye Stewart. He was told by coach Hap Day to simply [...] "stay with your check and keep him from scoring." [...] Kennedy's line scored three goals and he picked up one assist in a 5–5 tie. He then picked another assist in the next game in Boston. Kennedy had impressed the Leaf coaches, but his rights were still [...] "officially" [...] owned by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E

500|$|Scully goes to Skinner for help, but he {{initially}} refuses. Scully also summons X to Mulder's apartment, but he turns her down. On his way out, X is confronted by Skinner in an elevator. After {{the two men}} get into a vicious physical altercation, X divulges Mulder's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Mulder finds the stranded Allegiance, with its sail broken through a patch of shallow ice. Inside, he finds {{what seems to be}} the sub's only surviving crewman, whom Mulder correctly guesses is the disguised Bounty Hunter. The two struggle, during which Mulder becomes exposed to the Bounty Hunter's toxic blood. The Bounty Hunter claims that Samantha is still alive before dumping Mulder off the sail and submerging the Allegiance; Mulder is nearly cut in half with the sub's diving plane in the process. Mulder is discovered and rushed to the field hospital seen at the beginning of [...] "Colony", where Scully—having learned that the alien blood contains a retrovirus that dies in cold temperatures—convinces the doctors <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of the bath that would warm his body up.|$|E
500|$|Silver's early {{recordings}} displayed [...] "a crisp, chipper but slightly wayward style, idiosyncratic enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of {{the increasingly}} stratified realms of bebop". In contrast to the more elaborate bebop piano, he stressed straightforward melodies rather than complex harmonies, and included short riffs and motifs that came and went {{over the course of}} a solo. While his right hand provided cleanly played lines, his left added bouncy, darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual rumble. Silver [...] "always played percussively, rarely suggesting excessive force on the keys but mustering a crisp [...] sound." [...] His fingering was idiosyncratic, but this added to the individuality of his pianism, particularly to the authenticity of the blues facets of his playing. The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the overall assessment that [...] "Blues and gospel-tinged devices and percussive attacks give his methods a more colourful style, and a generous good humour gives all his records an upbeat feel." [...] Part of the humor was Silver's predilection for quoting other pieces of music in his own playing.|$|E
500|$|Work for {{the season}} lasted only until 11 September, by which time the barrack legs had been secured {{although}} not the main structure.

It began: [...] "Dear Sir, I am extremely sorry to inform you that the barrack erected on Skerryvore Rock has totally disappeared." [...] The structure had been destroyed during in a gale on 3 November and four months effort had been wasted. Stevenson hired a boat <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> to inspect the damage the same day he received this news. Firm in his self-belief, he resolved to build a stronger but otherwise identical replacement. Work began in April 1839 and by early September the completed barrack stood [...] above the rock. Entry was via ladders attached to the legs that led into the lowest level containing a kitchen. The middle level contained two cabins, one for Stevenson, the other for his master of works, whilst the top level provided sleeping quarters for a further 30 to 40 men.|$|E

He supposed its meaning to be the one commonplace about it - the oldest idea known to human thought. ...As Adams sat there, numbers of people came, for the figure seemed to have become a tourist fashion, and all wanted to know its meaning.... Like all great artists, St. Gaudens held up the mirror and no more." ...|$|R

500|$|In Hurley's words, Friday [...] "trained like he played"; [...] "he had {{no other}} way of playing". His new manager had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of {{training}} on occasion because of the injuries he would inflict on his own teammates {{in his effort to}} win. By late January 1974, Reading were on a run of 14 games with only two victories, while Friday had performed strongly in three reserve matches. Hurley registered the amateur forward to play in the Football League on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first-team debut four days later. Friday turned in a performance against Northampton Town at Elm Park that the Reading Evening Post called [...] "outstanding" [...] as Reading drew 3–3. The team then travelled to Barnsley on 3 February, having not won away from home in four months. After Barnsley led 2–0 at half-time, Friday scored his first League goal with a header just after the break to make the score 2–1. Reading immediately offered a professional contract, which Friday signed on 6 February 1974. His new salary was half what he had earned as an asphalter.|$|E
500|$|... {{known as}} , {{was one of}} the most talented of the Uchiha clan. Shisui was the best friend of Itachi Uchiha; in fact, Itachi thought of him as an older brother. Shisui wanted to stop the Uchiha's coup against Konohagakure, but Danzo stole one of his eyes and so he gave his other eye to Itachi to protect the village and jumped off a cliff and died, then later found on the river by the Uchiha {{military}} policemen. He possessed a unique Mangekyo Sharingan ability called Kotoamatsukami, which enables the user to completely subject other people under their control without their knowledge. The eye stolen by Danzo is later used by him to manipulate people for his benefits, including Mifune during the Kage Summit, but it is lost after he commits a suicide attack against Sasuke. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of Kabuto's reanimation jutsu. Itachi then destroys it so it could not be used by anyone again. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hidenobu Kiuchi, while his voice actor in the English adaptation is Nicolas Roye.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Presley's return to live {{performing}} in Las Vegas, Parker {{decided it was time}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>him</b> back <b>out</b> on tour {{for the first time in}} 13 years. The tours were so popular and financially successful that they determined Presley's workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker's main role during these tours was to plan the logistics and make sure tickets were sold. He would usually fly ahead to the venues and prepare the way for Presley's entourage to follow, so that he and [...] Presley rarely saw each other, and as time progressed it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley. These live performances, as well as being financially satisfying, also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley's recording contract with RCA. Between 1969 and 1972 alone, RCA released three albums of live material.|$|R
