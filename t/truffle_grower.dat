They offer a consistent experience, one you can guarantee to taste in the dish...they offer a simplified picture, a sort of cartoon version - bright and colourful but ultimately false".|$|E

40|$|Aim of study: The program "Typology of truffle {{stations}} in the Pyrenean Regions" aimed to define the ecological conditions and culture practices that favor Tuber melanosporum growth and fruiting in this area. Area of study: Navarra, Catalonia, Midi-Pyrenees and Languedoc-Roussillon. Material and methods: The program {{was based on the}} survey of 212 wild and cultivated truffle beds of evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex). The data collected in the field consisted of photographs, samples of soil, roots and mycorrhizae, and information on cultural practices followed by <b>truffle</b> <b>growers.</b> Main results: (i) truffle soils are alkaline, from neutral, dolomitic, to moderately or very calcareous soils; (ii) truffle soils are light, well-structured and stable to water immersion; (iii) mycelium that colonizes roots survives in suboptimal conditions, but it does not necessarily bear ascocarps. Finally our results suggest that T melanosporum is a relatively ubiquitous fungus able to grow, or at least to persist, {{in a wide range of}} physical and chemical soil conditions. We propose a probabilistic model of the environment favorable for fruiting, built around a two-dimensional graph with an axis for the chemical conditions, like soil alkalinity, and another axis for the physical conditions, like soil structure. Research highlights: Soil alkalinity and structure allow to built a convenient representation of the ecological capacity of a place to be good T melanosporum habitat, and thus of the probability for <b>truffle</b> <b>growers</b> to harvest <b>truffles</b> according to the environmental properties of their truffle orchards...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{northern}} part of the Mediterranean Basin recently experienced major transformations. Landscapes evolved along two contrasting trends: agricultural intensification and urbanization in the plains, and disuse of marginal areas. This led to a gradual disappearance of the naturaland cultural heritages associated with Mediterranean scrublands. To revitalize rural areas, promote sustainable development, preserve social-ecological heritages and cultural landscapes, decision-makers in Mediterranean France often support “traditional iconic activities”. Based on a case-study in Uzès (Languedoc-Roussillon Région, southern France), this paper attempts to characterize the potential of truffle (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) production, a symbolic but agriculturally marginal production, to respond to decision-makers expectations. The multidisciplinary approach developed includes landscape analysis, social surveys and plant inventories. Beyond the <b>truffle</b> <b>growers</b> and local decision-makers discourses and strategies, this paper shows that truffle-growing has limited implications in maintaining farmers and ensuring a sustainable development of the study area. Trufflegrowing reflects Uzès’ society transformation, now more influenced by recent urban needsand values than by rural aspirations and traditions. However, our study brings in favorable arguments regarding the roles of truffle-growing ecosystems for biodiversity and landscapeheterogeneity conservation...|$|R
40|$|Australian truffle {{growing in}} Australia {{is small and}} at {{the early stages of}} development. The {{industry}} produced approximately 1, 500 kilograms in 2009 with a wholesale price of between $ 1500 and $ 2, 000 / kilogram. A high proportion of growers operate on a small scale. As well as increasing area being planted, truffle production is increasing approximately 40 percent each year from existing planted areas to meet the growth in local and overseas demand. Commensurate with this growth is the pressure for the industry to develop its supply chain relationships and associated quality assurance (QA). This paper explores the QA assurance approaches suited to the truffle industry and reports industry stakeholder responses toward the implementation of such QA schemes. 110 industry members of the Australian <b>Truffle</b> <b>Growers</b> Association were {{invited to participate in the}} survey with 29 responding (26 percent). 20 of these agreed that the overall benefits to their business obtained from introducing a QA scheme would outweigh its costs. It was also generally perceived that QA would ensure continuous improvement and advance the professionalism of the industry. The study involved the design of a user‐friendly online questionnaire made accessible to the member group only...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{life cycles}} and {{dispersal}} of edible fungi are still poorly known, thus limiting {{our understanding of}} their evolution and domestication. The prized Tuber melanosporum produces fruitbodies (fleshy organs where meiospores mature) gathered in natural, spontaneously inoculated forests or harvested in plantations of nursery-inoculated trees. Yet, how fruitbodies are formed remains unclear, thus limiting yields, and how current domestication attempts affect population genetic structure is overlooked. Fruitbodies result from mating between two haploid individuals: the maternal parent forms the flesh and the meiospores, while the paternal parent only contributes to the meiospores. We analyzed the genetic diversity of T. melanosporum comparatively in spontaneous forests vs. plantations, using SSR polymorphism of 950 samples from South-East France. All populations displayed strong genetic isolation by distance at the metric scale, possibly due to animal dispersal, meiospore persistence in soil, and/or exclusion of unrelated individuals by vegetative incompatibility. High inbreeding was consistently found, suggesting that parents often develop from meiospores produced by the same fruitbody. Unlike maternal genotypes, paternal mycelia contributed to few fruitbodies each, did not persist over years, and were undetectable on tree mycorrhizae. Thus, we postulate that germlings from the soil spore bank act as paternal partners. Paternal genetic diversity and outbreeding were higher in plantations than in spontaneous truffle-grounds, perhaps because <b>truffle</b> <b>growers</b> disperse fruitbodies to maintain inoculation in plantations. However, planted and spontaneous populations were not genetically isolated, so that T. melanosporum illustrates an early step of domestication where genetic structure remains little affected...|$|R
40|$|Aim of study: In {{black truffle}} plantations, many factors are driving the {{emergence}} of new pests and diseases which in forestry areas go unnoticed. Usually, the incidence of most of them is low. Nevertheless, in specific cases, some of them are capable of causing irreversible damage that could endanger the harvest or even tree survival. Area of study: This paper presents an in-depth study of the pests and diseases more frequently associated with truffle plantations in the region of Aragón (Spain). Damages have been arranged into the main production stages: nursery, plantations and fruiting bodies. Material and methods: The data used in this work come from the technical enquiries from <b>truffle</b> <b>growers</b> to researchers and technical staff, as well as from field visits undertaken by those work teams. Sampling methodology has been carried out following standard procedures. Insects were collected with the traps commonly used in entomology works. Main result: More than 50 damages have been described in this paper. Some of them are capable of weakening the plants and other can even kill them. Mycorrhizal competitor fungi have also been considered in this paper. These organisms do not cause real phytosanitary problems, but they can lead to important economic losses. Research highlights: Researches, truffle hunters and managers must be alert {{in the face of the}} possible occurrence of potentially dangerous organisms.
