A group around Robespierre – later indicated as 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' – pleaded against that war; this opposition between those groups would harden and embitter in the next 1½ years.|$|E

[...] His stroke, Nick Robinson, commented: [...] "It was going pretty well until the clash, but they came out better than we did." [...] Umpire Mike Sweeney was unperturbed: [...] "They were both fighting for the same water. [...] That {{is not a question}} of disqualification." [...] Cambridge's Story said his crew were confident before the race: [...] "We were never in doubt that we would win" [...] and despite the record time, he remarked [...] "We can row a lot better than that." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Wisden in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre [...] "was {{particularly}} strong in cutting and playing to leg". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer, suggested in 1928 that [...] "there {{was something about}} Ollivierre that reminded {{one of the great}} Ranji. He was a more heavily built man than the slim Ranji of the days when we were young; but his strokes and his movements had real grace." [...] A correspondent in the Observer in 1931 remembered Ollivierre as a [...] "great batsman", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a list of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves justice at the highest level: [...] "Geniuses who have just lost their way...every one of them in possession of an excellent enough record in county cricket, but every one of <b>them</b> <b>really</b> intended by nature to wear the most precious laurels the greatest of games has to offer".|$|E

500|$|Control {{and camera}} {{movement}} concerned reviewers. Bettenhausen called the controls [...] "a tad reckless at first – Sonic's momentum takes {{some getting used}} to, and trying to go in reverse is a pain – but become more natural and fluid as you get acclimated to the fast-paced, twitchy action." [...] Casamassina and Mueller offered similar opinions, while Shepperd criticized the game's low camera angle and arbitrary targeting system. Bettenhausen dismissed the game's multiplayer mode as a failed adaptation of the Mario Party series. Fahey concurred, adding that a multiplayer racing mode would have been preferable to [...] "lame" [...] minigames. Casamassina compared the games to those in : [...] "only a handful of <b>them</b> <b>really</b> stand out and some are downright pointless, but overall gamers will probably be happy that they were included." [...] Shepperd agreed, but decried the necessity to [...] "play the story mode extensively to unlock some of the party mode's best features." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Bell and Menzel {{had to do}} a lot of {{recordings}} and re-recordings, and were required to be together in the same room when on the key emotional scenes between Anna and Elsa. [...] "We even got Kristen and Idina together for a song. That really helped elevate the song because they have a duet in the movie and it definitely helped drive that," [...] said producer Peter Del Vecho. Chris Buck later commented that getting the actresses in together as much as they could helped add the real, amazing chemistry between them and made <b>them</b> <b>really</b> interact. Bell's recording sessions were completed while she was pregnant, and later she had to re-record some of the lines after giving birth, as her voice had deepened. After watching the completed film, Bell described her performance as [...] "cool and weird and surreal and jarring", saying that she was really proud that Anna [...] "came out like she did that [...] let [...] do her like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in <b>them,</b> <b>really</b> old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of <b>them</b> <b>really</b> made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of <b>them</b> <b>really,</b> really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that we were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed to be me and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't.
