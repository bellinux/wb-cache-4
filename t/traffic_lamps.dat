In order to obtain intelligence in transportation, ITSs have utilized {{the advantages of the}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), providing several different technological systems that help users. Among the possible ICTs, ITSs are now considering the use of VLC, focusing on two aspects. First of all, it is possible to repurpose the transportation lighting infrastructure for communication. Recently, the transportation lighting infrastructure such as street <b>lamps,</b> <b>traffic</b> lights, automotive <b>lamps,</b> etc., is changing to LEDs. Therefore, {{in the case of an}} ITS based on VLC, it will be possible to make use of the conventional automotive and traffic LEDs. Consequently, the cost incurred in constructing the ITS infrastructure will be reduced. Second, the electro magnetic compatibility problem, which is a very serious problem in ITSs based on RF signals, will be minimized since visible light and the conventional RF signals occupy different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is an {{important}} aspect in urban traffic control to make the arterial traffic operate under good condition. The prevalent method is by coordinating the <b>traffic</b> signal <b>lamps</b> to obtain the progression on a corridor. In China, a majority of loop detectors are broken and not working {{because of the lack}} of maintenance. Time-of–day (TOD) timing plans were developed offline on these arterial nodes. A coordination signal timing plan consists of three parameters, namely cycle length, phase split and offset. Because of the difference of traffic volume, speed, etc., a timing plan implemented in a certain time interval is different to those in other intervals in one day. So it needs to be solved to make timing plan smooth transition from one to the next. In this paper, the practical methods were improved by selecting reasonable offset and cycle length to make signal transitions smooth and speedy.

The NW LED core–shell structure geometry also allows growth on non-polar m-planes to avoid undesirable quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE).|$|R

40|$|The {{limiting}} membrane of the lysosome {{contains a}} group of transmembrane glycoproteins named lysosome-associated membrane proteins (Lamps). These proteins are targeted to lysosomes by virtue of tyrosine-based sorting signals in their cytosolic tails. Four adaptor protein (AP) complexes, AP- 1, AP- 2, AP- 3, and AP- 4, interact with such signals and are therefore candidates for mediating sorting of the Lamps to lysosomes. However, the role of these complexes and of the coat protein, clathrin, in sorting of the Lamps in vivo has either not been addressed or remains controversial. We have used RNA interference to show that AP- 2 and clathrin—and {{to a lesser extent}} the other AP complexes—are required for efficient delivery of the Lamps to lysosomes. Because AP- 2 is exclusively associated with plasma membrane clathrin coats, our observations imply that a significant population of <b>Lamps</b> <b>traffic</b> via the plasma membrane en route to lysosomes...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{measurement}} and verification (M&V) cost minimisation model is proposed {{to deal with}} both the M&V modelling and sampling uncertainties. In order to find the optimal solutions {{in terms of the}} modelling accuracy level, and the sample size, the M&V cost that includes the modelling cost, sampling cost, and overhead cost is formulated as the objective function, in which the modelling cost is developed {{as a function of the}} modelling accuracy in terms of the coefficient of variation of the room mean square error (CV(RMSE)), and the sampling cost, which is directly related to the sample size. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, an optimal M&V modelling and sampling strategy is designed for a <b>traffic</b> intersection <b>lamp</b> retrofit project. In addition, partial optimal M&V plans designed with optimal sampling but non-optimal modelling solutions, or with optimal modelling but non-optimal sampling solutions are employed as the benchmark. Comparisons between the optimal and non-optimal solutions show advantageous cost savings performance in the execution of sampling and modelling activities for the case study. More precisely, the optimal solutions reduce the sampling cost by 55 % and the total M&V cost by 14 % against the solutions obtained by optimal modelling but non-optimal sampling solutions. To test the applicability and flexibility of the proposed model for the cost-effective design of similar traffic light retrofit projects, simulations have been carried out to evaluate the model performance when applying the model to M&V projects with different characteristics. The simulation results show that the proposed model is able to offer flexible trade-offs between the modelling and sampling uncertainties; namely, using more accurate baseline models and smaller sample sizes or less accurate baseline models but greater sample sizes to accommodate different practical needs in executing M&V projects with different characteristics. The major contributions of this study can be highlighted as follows: 1) a M&V modelling cost model is developed, which is able to offer a quantitative analysis of the M&V baseline model uncertainty and cost; and, 2) a M&V cost minimisation model is proposed to handle both the M&V modelling and sampling uncertainties cost-effectively. The effectiveness and flexibility of this model are demonstrated by a case study and simulations.

Accurate MLS {{data can be}} used for detailed 3 D modelling of the road surface and objects around it. The 3 D models can be utilised, for example, in street planning and maintenance and noise modelling. Utility poles, <b>traffic</b> signs, and <b>lamp</b> posts can be considered an important part of road infrastructure. Poles and trees stand out from the environment and should be included in realistic 3 D models. Detection of narrow vertical objects, such as poles and tree trunks, from MLS data was studied. MLS produces huge amounts of data and, therefore, processing methods should be as automatic as possible and for the methods to be practical, the algorithms should run in an acceptable time. The automatic pole detection method tested in this study is based on first finding point clusters that are good candidates for poles and then separating poles and tree trunks from other clusters using features calculated from the clusters and by applying a mask that acts as a model of a pole. The method achieved detection rates of 77. 7 % and 69. 7 % in the field tests while 81. 0 % and 86. 5 % of the detected targets were correct. Pole-like targets that were surrounded by other objects, such as tree trunks that were inside branches, were the most difficult to detect.

40|$|Both TRPML 1 and TRPML 3 {{are members}} of the mucolipin {{subfamily}} of Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels. They have been implicated in endolysosomal functions such as divalent cation release, luminal pH regulation, autophagy and vesicle trafficking. Interestingly, whereas TRPML 1 is almost extensively localized in lysosomes, TRPML 3 is typically found in both lysosomes and the plasma membrane (PM). It has been shown that TRPML 3 localization depends on TRPML 1, but the mechanism remains unknown. Recently, a number of TRPML 1 mutants have been reported to be either retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or preferentially targeted to the PM. Coexpressing these mutants with either wild type TRPML 3 or a non-functional ER-retained mutant, TRPML 3 -KK, I examined how differentially targeted TRPML 1 proteins affect TRPML 3 localization. I show that while the wild type TRPML 1 decreased the PM targeting of TRPML 3, the PM-targeted TRPML 1 mutants did not enhance PM localization of TRPML 3. Interestingly, not only the wild type TRPML 1 brought TRPML 3 -KK to lysosomes, but also TRPML 3 brought the ER-retained TRPML 1 -KK mutant to these acidic organelles. Moreover, coexpression of TRPML-KK not only reduced TRPML 3 -mediated Ca 2 + response to a TRPML agonist, ML-SA 1, but also nearly abolished PM localization of TRPML 3. Activation of heteromultimeric TRPML 1 / 3 channels by ML-SA 1 significantly increased the PM-localized TRPML 3, while the TRPML channel inhibitor, ML-SI 1, did not decrease the PM-localized TRPML 3. Consistently, co-expressing a non-functional lysosome-localized TRPML 1 mutant, TRPML 1 -F 465 L with TRPML 3 decreased the PM-localized TRPML 3 as efficiently as wildtype TRPML 1. I conclude that while the lysosome targeting sequence(s) is important for sorting TRPML channels out of ER-Golgi network, the ion-conducting function is important for TRPML channels to be trafficked to plasma membrane, but not for their endocytosis. Genetically encoded fluorescence probes have gained popularity nowadays because of the ease to target them to specific subcellular compartments. GCaMPs are widely used genetically encoded calcium indicators, which exhibit dramatic increases in fluorescence upon binding to Ca 2 +. In order to assess Ca 2 + signals generated from opening of TRPML 1 channel, as well as that from lysosomes, I have engineered two constructs: with GCaMP 5 G fused to either the C-terminus of TRPML 1 or that of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP 1). To my surprise, however, both engineered probes were able to sense Ca 2 + released from ER and Ca 2 + entry through PM. They did not show specific utility in detecting lysosomal Ca 2 + release. <b>Trafficking</b> of <b>LAMP</b> 1 and TRPML 1 were apparently disrupted with the conjugation of GCaMP 5 G. Specifically, LAMP 1 -GCaMP 5 G and TRPML 1 -GCaMP 5 G showed prominent PM localization, unlike the GFP-tagged LAMP 1 and TRPML 1, which preferentially target to the lysosomes. In addition, TRPML 1 -GCaMP 5 G also appeared in enlarged vesicles with bright green fluorescence. These results suggest that cautions should be taken when using engineered GCaMPs to study subcellular localized Ca 2 + signals using tagged proteins...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{are promising}} tools for imaging and drug delivery; however their mechanisms of cellular internalisation and trafficking await full characterisation. Current knowledge suggests that following endocytosis {{many types of}} uncoated NPs get delivered into endosomes and lysosomes. However, the mechanisms of cellular internalisation and trafficking of nanomaterials depend {{on a variety of}} factors, including the structural and physicochemical characteristics of the material itself, the biological molecules coating the nanomaterial (the corona), as well as specific cell-type differences in the endocytic machinery. In order to design effective drug delivery strategies that can use or by-pass the endocytic pathway, a comprehensive understanding of NP uptake mechanisms is therefore necessary. The present study describes design, testing, optimisation and application of an RNA interference (RNAi) -based high content screening (HCS) microscopy strategy to assess the intracellular trafficking of fluorescently-labelled 40 nm negatively charged polystyrene carboxylated NPs in HeLa cells. Firstly, NPs were characterised and a NP uptake assay and HCS analysis routine to evaluate internalisation and trafficking of NPs was developed. The assay was first implemented for a set of 10 siRNAs targeting known components of various endocytic mechanisms. A role for the large GTPase dynamin 2 in trafficking of NPs to LAMP 1 -positive compartments was determined by automated HCS, thus establishing the principle that cellular depletion of individual endocytosis components is sufficient to result in a phenotypic effect in terms of delivery of NPs to endo/lysosomes. Secondly, a library targeting 58 proteins belonging to the family of Rab small GTPases was interrogated. siRNA treatments inducing a strong reduction of NP <b>trafficking</b> to <b>LAMP</b> 1 -positive membranes were validated by both HCS and quantitative PCR analysis. This revealed a role for the late endosomal RAB 7 A in the process, as well as identifying a previously unreported role for the Golgi associated RAB 33 B. Further relevance of RAB 33 B was investigated using a GFP-tagged protein overexpression approach, revealing a significant role for RAB 33 B and its GTPase activating protein (GAP) OATL 1 in the trafficking of NPs through early endocytic membranes and late endosomes/lysosomes. This approach was next extended to an siRNA library targeting 348 genes involved in cytoskeleton organisation, function and regulation. A total of 39 siRNA treatments resulted in a strong decrease in NP trafficking. Of particular note was the identification of several motor protein subunits (DYNC 1 H 1, KIF 15, and MYO 6) and proteins associated with actin and microtubule structure and remodelling (ARPC 2, CDC 42, CFL 1, PLS 3, TUBB). Among these, the motor protein myosin VI (MYO 6), a recently established regulator of endocytosis and autophagy was selected for further studies in the context of GFP-tagged protein overexpression. This revealed partial co-localisation of NPs with myosin VI positive structures, and relevance of its cargo-selective autophagy receptor interacting motif for the trafficking of NPs to LAMP 1 -positive membranes. Finally, the RNAi HCS approach was used to systematically deplete 21, 585 genes annotated in the human genome as a first attempt to comprehensively map the main regulators of internalisation and trafficking of NPs. In silico validation of the strongest candidate genes was carried out in the context of previously published transcriptomic data. Annotation, clustering and enrichment analyses of the validated target genes were also carried out. Bioinformatic protein-protein interaction studies of enriched target gene clusters annotated as being associated with the endomembrane system were performed, further providing evidence of the involvement of clathrin coated vesicle components (CLTC, DNM 2 and AP 2) and the cytoskeleton (ARPC 2) in the intracellular trafficking of NPs. These studies also revealed potential roles for several endosomal proteins (RABEPK, RABEP 1, HOPS/CORVET), TGN to endosomal trafficking complexes (COGs, TRAPPs, AP 1) and lysosomal acidification machinery (V-ATP 6). In conclusion, the results presented in this work provide the first comprehensive molecular overview of the bio-nano interaction space paving the way for the design of improved intracellular drug delivery strategies...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPP refers to the provision of public assets and service through {{the participation of the}} government, the private sector and the consumers. The purpose is to analyze the main risks involved in a PPP initiative and to understand how they affect its capital structure. To this aim, different datasets have been analyzed in order to trace consistent and coherent lessons. After that, this thesis aims at proposing PPP models for innovative project in the Smart City context, {{based on the assumption that}} innovative financial schemes can fit innovative projects. In particular several PPPs for Smart City projects have been analyzed and a Project Finance contract for the replacement of <b>traffic</b> light <b>lamps</b> has been proposed so that the applicability of the financial tool in new fields of application have been tested. The success of a PF initiative is strictly related to a careful analysis of all the risks associated with the project. As a matter of fact, many risks could occur during the life of the project and they can significantly affect its outcomes. For this reason risks have been categorized in sources and associated to their indicators. For each indicator, several parameters have been identified. The main sources of risk are Country, Financial, Market and Construction. First a dataset of worldwide toll road has been analyzed. The private concessionaire that constructs the infrastructure collects revenues generated by users, and the infrastructure by itself represents a solid collateral. The analysis highlights that inflation rate, the investment size, the construction duration, the financial strength of the Special Purpose Vehicle and the number of partners has a significant influence with the share of the equity into the total investment. This study might help the purpose of providing better opportunities for sponsors to improve the equity profitability and for lending agencies to better handle with risks associated with the debt supply. The analysis has been then focused on the British market, which is one of the most important ones and wherein the Project Finance is actually developed and the legislative context is well defined. Based on the idea that the Unitary Charge (UC) periodically corresponded by the public authority (and in turn the capital structure) is associated with the project risk profile, the study investigates risks that might have significant impacts on the UC of a PF hospital project. The study demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a higher level of Value for Money (VFM) in PF hospital projects within a good economic and political environment. In Italy the PF market has rapidly grown, in light of the need for the public sector to find a feasible way to construct or renovate infrastructures in a context of scarce public finance. Based on past projects developed in Italy an empirical analysis has been carried out in order to identify the main aspects that can impact on the success of a PF initiative. As a matter of fact, evidence has shown that not all the projects appear to fit for PF, and often a project fails to go further out of the early contract procurement phases. Therefore, there is the need to understand what are the key factors affecting the construction of a PF initiative. The study shows that large-sized projects developed in wealthy conditions in terms of political and economic stability and levels of GDP, have good chances to be constructed, especially whenever the time is given to parties to negotiate the contract provision. The analysis provides with a hint for policy makers to learn that PF is a valuable system to be used in stable and developed environments for large projects with little time pressure. PF mechanism was launched in Italy in 1999 and after ten years the Italian market is the second largest one in Europe, especially in the healthcare sector. However, financially freestanding privately-funded PF hospitals are rare and the capital structure of most projects requires a considerable share of public funding. The most proper amount of money invested by the public authority should cover the non-self-financing (and therefore the riskier ones) of the investment costs, but it often happens that the level of public contribution exceeds this limit. The results of the analysis highlight that the financial strength of the SPV, the number of services that are granted to the private partners, the level of borrowing of the public authority, and the duration of the concession period appear to be significant factors of the public fraction of financing required to deliver the project. These results originate some important considerations about the relevance of risks in the development of PF initiatives. PF better fits in stable politic and economic environments, but at the same time it is largely adopted in emerging countries with large demand of new infrastructures and high level of risk (in terms of level of transparency, corruptions, currency exchange). From a financial perspective a robust SPV is likely to better deal with the project with a positive impact on the capital structure. The market risk is associated with the number of customers that exploit the facility and the number of services that privates manage. If the demand of services is not enough to generate sustainable profits, the public party could reimburse an additional fee, in order to cover for this risk. The project risk is mainly related to the complexity of the project in terms of the number of partners in the SPV and the investment size. The last part of the thesis is associated to the future and potential scenarios associated to PF and more in general to PPP scheme. In fact the aim is to propose PPP models in the smart city (SC) arena, a promising field of innovation and investments. SC appears to be as a new paradigm to carry out innovation that marks a shift between traditional way of completing technology-push processes and the new approach based on the user's needs. In this political and economic scenario, the PPP seems to be a solution for the development of smart projects and the design of PPP models should become an integral part of the SC agendas. As demonstrated in the development of traditional infrastructure, the involvement of privates allows to manage more efficiently the project. The analysis shows that PF is more applicable in case of projects with tangible assets, and the main strength of this scheme is the clear separation between the cash flows of the SPV and the cash flows of the investors. On the contrary, PF is more expensive in terms of contractual and transactional costs. These aspects related to PF have fostered to develop a proposal model for the application of this financial scheme in the Municipality of Torino. In particular the project is based on the replacement of the traditional <b>lamps</b> of the <b>traffic</b> lights with new ones exploiting the innovative LED technology that is supposed to guarantee savings in terms of energy consumption and maintenance cost. The project has proved to be bankable and profitable if the Public Authority corresponds a fee that includes both the availability of the lamps and the maintenance costs for ten years. On the contrary the project is only bankable and profits are not guaranteed if the fee paid by the public is only associated with the availability. The findings have validated the applicability of PF even in case of projects without assets systems as collateral and with small-medium investments size. Some first general guidelines for the policy maker are provided in order to foster the development of SC initiative even in a period of financial public shortage. Project Finance, and more in general the PPP, can be the engine of an efficient exploitation of the potentiality offered by the S...|$|R
