5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close scrutiny by Union forces, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, {{visitors}} could {{purchase an}} early guidebook {{at the site}} outlining the castle's history, and Victorian tourists recorded being charged six-pence to wander around the castle. In the early 1820s, the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick attempted to purchase the site, {{with the aim of}} converting the castle back into a private dwelling, but was unable to convince the owners to sell. Instead, Meyrick built the neo-gothic Goodrich Court in a similar style next door, which greatly displeased Wordsworth when he returned to Goodrich in 1841 and found the view spoilt by the new building.

5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's sense of the Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews {{were not allowed to}} cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.|$|E

In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E
