5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the telescope {{was used to}} track a variety of space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank {{was asked by the}} Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|The Lovell Telescope {{was used}} to track both Soviet and American probes aimed at the Moon in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In terms of American space probes, the {{telescope}} tracked Pioneer 1 from 11 to 13 November 1958, Pioneer 3 in December 1958, and Pioneer 4 in March 1959. The telescope tracked Pioneer 5 between 11 March and 26 June 1960, and was also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more powerful transmitter when the probe was 8 million miles (12.9 million km) away. It also received data from Pioneer 5, and was the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 The last signal was picked up from the probe {{at a distance of}} 36.2 million kilometers on the 26 June 1960.|$|E
30|$|Next, a {{discontinuity}} {{is observed}} at 1 day of elapsed time. This corresponds <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Quartz-Tungsten-Halogen (QTH) lamp to provide heat {{directly to the}} surface of the sample. As expected, this event corresponds to sudden increases in the temperature and pressure. Immediately following this event, both signals return to their initial tendencies: a decline in pressure at the manometer, and a stable temperature signal. Since the temperature stabilizes within ten minutes, thermal equilibrium is achieved quickly.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the short}} line to Chesham {{generally}} {{had a good}} safety record, despite its sharp curves and relatively steep gradient, it suffered two significant accidents in this period. On 19August 1909 the Aclass engine hauling the 7.53am train from Chesham broke an axle and derailed outside Chesham. There were no injuries but the track was blocked; a passenger service was maintained by operating shuttle services from {{each end of the}} branch to the crash site, where passengers were obliged to walk around the derailed engine to change trains. On 6November 1909 a backdraught from a locomotive firebox enveloped Robert Prior, the train's driver, in flames. (The type of locomotive is not recorded, but it is likely to have been a Metropolitan Railway D Class, which are known to have had a problem with backdraughts.) The locomotive's fireman managed to drive the train to Chesham, where Prior died from his injuries two days later. An inquest found that Prior had failed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blower, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through reduction gearing, a set of three slow-turning cams. These cams would actuate switches <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, break, or go out of adjustment.|$|E
25|$|All three {{crew members}} on board died when the {{aircraft}} struck the ground following a stall and rapid descent {{caused by the}} crew's reaction to erroneous airspeed readings caused by atmospheric icing. The icing occurred due to failure <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pitot tube heating {{at the start of}} the flight. This was one of two Boeing 727s to crash in the United States that day; the other was TWA Flight 514 in northern Virginia, northwest of Dulles airport.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, Bong had {{accumulated}} four hours and fifteen minutes of flight time (totaling 12 flights) in the P-80. The I-16 fuel pump was a later addition to the plane (after an earlier fatal crash) and Bong himself was quoted by Captain Ray Crawford (another P-80 test/acceptance flight pilot who flew the day Bong was killed) as saying that he had forgotten <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> I-16 pump on an earlier flight.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the first}} exposition, the 1935 Fair was so {{successful}} it was extended for a second year. Opening ceremonies for the second season began when President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressed a gold telegraph key in the White House <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exposition’s lights. He later visited the exposition; other notable guests included Herbert Hoover, Mae West, and Jack Dempsey. Funded at $20 million, the 1935–1936 event counted 6.7 million visitors—almost double the total of the 1915–16 exposition.|$|E
25|$|Because {{thyristors}} {{can only}} be turned on (not off) by control action, and rely on the external AC system to effect the turn-off process, the control system only has one degree of freedom – when <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thyristor. This limits the usefulness of HVDC in some circumstances because {{it means that the}} AC system to which the HVDC converter is connected must always contain synchronous machines in order to provide the commutating voltage – the HVDC converter cannot feed power into a passive system.|$|E
40|$|Water {{supply and}} water use are {{extremely}} complex issues with many interrelating aspects. As a result, the Drought Management Project at Utah State University encompasses an extremely diverse set {{of people and}} disciplines, including climate, hydrology, engineering, soil science, horticulture, plant physiology, plant genetics, and sociology. We are unable to study the complex system in its entirety and in all its detail. However, this project is targeting key issues {{from the study of}} precipitation falling in the mountains to decisions leading <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water tap.

25|$|The 350-16 had an {{interesting}} bug where, occasionally, the machine would just freeze entirely and not even boot up if turned off and on at the mains. Although it would power on, the BIOS just didn't start. The solution was <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machine at the mains and hold down the power button for 30 seconds, at which point it would normally start. It was suggested that {{this was due to}} an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E
25|$|Faubus's victory led to {{a series}} of {{consequences}} that affected Little Rock society. Faubus's intention to open private schools was denied the same day the referendum took place, which caused some citizens of Little Rock <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> black community. The black community became a target for hate crimes since people blamed them for the closing of the schools. Daisy Bates, head of the NAACP chapter in Little Rock, was a primary victim to these crimes, in addition to the black students enrolled at Little Rock Central High School and their families.|$|E
25|$|On November 29, 2006, a telemetered {{command to}} Voyager 2 was {{incorrectly}} decoded by its on-board computer—in a random error—as a command <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electrical heaters of the spacecraft's magnetometer. These heaters remained turned on until December 4, 2006, {{and during that}} time, there was a resulting high temperature above , {{significantly higher than the}} magnetometers were designed to endure, and a sensor rotated away from the correct orientation.
