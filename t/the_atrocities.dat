5|$|In 1974 the {{commission}} was reopened and issued a supplementary report, which remained classified for 25 years until published by the magazine India Today. The report said that 26,000 people were killed, rapes numbered in the hundreds, and that the Mukti Bahini rebels engaged in widespread rape and other human rights abuses. Sumit Ganguly, a political scientist, believes that the Pakistani establishment has yet {{to come to terms}} with <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> carried out, saying that, in a visit to Bangladesh in 2002, Pervez Musharraf expressed regret for <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> rather than accepting responsibility.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{academic}} {{consensus that the}} events of the nine-month conflict were a genocide. <b>The</b> <b>atrocities</b> in East Pakistan were the first instances of war rape to attract international media attention, and Sally J.

The women's human rights organisation Bangladesh Mahila Parishat took part in the war by publicising <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> being carried out by the Pakistani army.|$|E

5|$|The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II is a bestselling 1997 non-fiction {{book written}} by Iris Chang about the 1937–1938 Nanking Massacre, the {{massacre}} and atrocities {{committed by the}} Imperial Japanese Army after it captured Nanjing, then capital of China, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It describes the {{events leading up to}} the Nanking Massacre and <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> that were committed. The book presents the view that the Japanese government has not done enough to redress <b>the</b> <b>atrocities.</b> It {{is one of the first}} major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to Western and Eastern readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Muslim League, such as Nizam-e-Islam, Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamiat Ulema Pakistan, who {{had lost}} the election, collaborated with the {{military}} and acted as an intelligence organisation for them.

5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to {{negotiate}} with the Catholic Party, which held power for much of his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E

5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the campaigns}} of 1778, Brant {{achieved}} an undeserved reputation for brutality. He {{was not present}} at Wyoming — although many thought he was — and he actively sought to minimize <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> that took place at Cherry Valley. Diaries belonging to British soldiers during the campaign state the regiment as being the butchers and given that Butler was the overall commander of the expedition, there is controversy with whom actually ordered or failed to restrain the killings. The massacre contributed to calls for reprisals, leading to the 1779 Sullivan Expedition which drove the Iroquois out of western New York.|$|E

Konrad then manipulates Walker into executing an Emirati survivor or a 33rd soldier, who both committed serious crimes. Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply. Delta aids Riggs {{with the aim of}} crippling the 33rd's operations, but Riggs destroys the supply instead, admitting he wanted to wipe out the remaining population of Dubai to cover up <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> of the 33rd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5|$|On {{a similar}} note, both {{countries}} {{would continue to}} conceal any war crimes committed by the other side {{for the remainder of}} the war. The Holocaust was systematically concealed by the leadership in Tokyo, just as Japanese war crimes, e.g. the situation in China, were kept secret from the German public. An example would be <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> committed by the Japanese Army in Nanking in 1937, which were denounced by German industrialist John Rabe. Subsequently, the German leadership ordered Rabe back to Berlin, confiscating all his reports and prohibiting any further discussion of the topic.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed <b>the</b> <b>atrocities</b> on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E
