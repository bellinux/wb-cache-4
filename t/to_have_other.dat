5|$|While {{the status}} of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some {{scholars}} have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be obligatory future markers. However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> semantics {{that can be used to}} refer to the future via the strategies just described.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> murals commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Workshops, {{later to}} be known as the East Workshops, were built to {{rehabilitate}} prisoners, and aid in site construction. A blacksmith's shop was constructed in 1852, and a carpenters’ shop was added in 1858. The prison was designed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> services onsite, including a kitchen, with four boilers, scullery, pantry, cool room and stores; a bakehouse and ovens, with separate stores for flour and bread; as well as a washhouse, laundry and drying room. The building holding these services was completed in 1855. A separate building, a hospital providing medical services, was also planned, but was one of the last to be constructed. The foundations were laid in 1857, but the plans were changed the next year to provide additional space to isolate contagious or dangerous patients. The hospital was finished in 1859.|$|E

25|$|Holtz {{observed}} that tyrannosaurids had the longest limbs {{relative to their}} body size of any theropod dinosaurs apart from the ostrich dinosaurs and a small, slender ceratosaur called Elaphrosaurus. Although the ostrich dinosaur on average had relatively longer limbs overall, the ratios of femur length {{to the length of}} the tibia and fibula were actually very close between the smaller tyrannosaurs and the largest ostrich dinosaurs. Holtz found ostrich dinosaurs and tyrannosaurs <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> traits of the hindlimb in common as well. Both groups had a pinched third metatarsal, called an arctometatarsus, that strengthened the foot. Holtz concluded that these traits indicated that tyrannosaurids were among the best adapted for running of all carnivorous dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|During most {{of human}} {{prehistory}} groups of hunter-gatherers were probably very small. Such groups probably {{made contact with}} other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused epidemic diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals {{who have not yet}} developed an adequate immune response. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a chronic infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> additional species as reservoir where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a dead-end host. Examples include rabies, anthrax, tularemia and West Nile virus. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.|$|E

500|$|Because {{of popular}} demand and {{favorable}} reception of Deadly Alliance, {{the number of}} finishing moves, known as Fatalities, increased to two per character.

The Hara-Kiri moves were added to allow the losers to perform a finishing move as well, creating a race between both players. The Death Traps, meant to be introduced in the previous game, were added to give the combat more strategy as well as to give more chances to players to win a fight if they are at a disadvantage. The game was originally meant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> new finishing moves, such as tortures and falling cliffs similar to Fatalities.|$|E
500|$|Differences in {{the bodies}} of {{children}} and adults lead to different manifestations of pulmonary contusion and associated injuries; for example, children have less body mass, so the same force {{is more likely to}} lead to trauma in multiple body systems. [...] Since their chest walls are more flexible, children are more vulnerable to pulmonary contusion than adults are, and thus suffer from the injury more commonly. Pulmonary contusion has been found in 53% of children with chest injuries requiring hospitalization. Children in forceful impacts suffer twice as many pulmonary contusions as adults with similar injury mechanisms, yet have proportionately fewer rib fractures. [...] The rates of certain types of injury mechanisms differ between children and adults; for example, children are more often hit by cars as pedestrians. [...] Some differences in children's physiology might be advantageous (for example they are less likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>other</b> medical conditions), and thus they have been predicted to have a better outcome. However, despite these differences, children with pulmonary contusion have similar mortality rates to adults.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Nosaka {{secretly}} {{traveled to}} the West Coast of the United States, where he became involved in intelligence {{work on behalf of}} the International Liaison Department of the Comintern against the Imperial Japanese government. [...] Nosaka's activities included disseminating information to communists still active in Japan, infiltrating and making contact with the Japanese communities active in the United States, and establishing a number of communist front organizations in Seattle, Los Angeles, and other cities on the West Coast.

[...] Because the records from this period are incomplete, historians cannot be certain to what extent Nosaka's efforts in America were successful. Nosaka worked as a Comintern agent in America until 1938, when he returned to Moscow. In 1940, the Comintern ordered Nosaka to aid communist forces in China.|$|E
