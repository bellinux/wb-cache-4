5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in}} which it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> patients {{treated with the}} ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once {{a feature of the}} diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{introduction}} of a veal-based sandwich raised the ire of animal rights groups. By 1982, several groups were alleging that the veal being sourced to Burger King was most likely kept in battery cages, unable to move, and fed a low iron diet designed to produce the lightly toned meat associated with veal. As {{a result of this}} protest, these groups lead a three-country boycott of Burger King in April 1982. Critics of the boycott claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> veal that was being used was more-likely to be free range veal due to cost issues, claiming that there is simply no way a $2.00 sandwich would use the higher quality $15.00/lb veal. The rights groups refused to back down despite the cost claims because Burger King would only release the name of the meat processor, not its veal suppliers. The chain eventually announced that it intended to pull the sandwich from the market, stating that it was not because of the boycotts but because {{there was a lack of}} consumer demand. In fact, the chain said the sandwich sold best in the markets where the majority of the protests were occurring.|$|E

25|$|While we {{know about}} the types of {{cytokine}} patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided.

Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear or colored acrylic lacquer or silver plate over the brass. The lacquer or plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> lacquer or plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors.

500|$|Archaeological {{findings}} have been unearthed at two sites in the Glacier Bay, which links the region to Holocene period. On the Baranoff Island, a prehistoric finding dates occupation of the region between 3200 and 4600 BP. Another finding {{in the form of}} a house, microlithic tools and heavy wood working tools at Ground Hog Bay has been dated to about 2000 BP. This is stated to be [...] "towards the end of the Hypsithermal (thermal maximum climatic fluctuation) and the beginning of the Little Ice Age". Thus, it has been interpreted by comparison with similarly placed locations in the region, such as the southern coast of British Columbia, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> culture seen here is comparable to the culture that existed during historic times on the Northwest Coast.
