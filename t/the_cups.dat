5|$|The 2003–04 {{season was}} the 109th {{in the history}} of Arsenal Football Club. It began on 1 July 2003 and {{concluded}} on 30 June 2004, with competitive matches played between August and May. The club ended the Premier League campaign as champions without a single defeat – a record of 26 wins and 12 draws. Arsenal fared less well in <b>the</b> <b>cups,</b> eliminated in the FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals to Manchester United and Middlesbrough respectively, and at the quarter-final stage of the UEFA Champions League to Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal, {{the match}} favourites and holders of the Football League Cup, were making their fourth final {{appearance}} in the competition. They had won the League Cup once before, in 1987, and lost two consecutive finals in 1968 and 1969. By contrast Luton Town were making their first League Cup final appearance. The club enjoyed relative success in <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> during the 1987–88 season, reaching the last four of the FA Cup and final of the Full Members Cup. Arsenal and Luton had only played each other once in the League Cup; George Graham the present-day manager of Arsenal, scored the decider in a third-round tie on 6 October 1970. Luton's last victory against Arsenal came in March 1986, a 3–0 win in an FA Cup fifth round, second replay.|$|E
5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.|$|E
50|$|By 1968, all UEFA {{member nations}} {{had set up}} {{domestic}} cup competitions due {{to the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup. UEFA regarded it as the second most prestigious competition, behind <b>the</b> European <b>Cup</b> (later <b>the</b> UEFA Champions League) and ahead of <b>the</b> Fairs <b>Cup</b> (later <b>the</b> UEFA <b>Cup).</b> Therefore, a team qualified for both <b>the</b> European <b>Cup</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup would play in <b>the</b> European <b>Cup,</b> whereas a team qualified for both <b>the</b> UEFA <b>Cup</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup would play in <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup. Nevertheless, many commentators and fans regarded <b>the</b> <b>Cup</b> Winners' Cup as weaker than <b>the</b> UEFA <b>Cup,</b> which had more and better teams from the stronger European leagues.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cup</b> {{consists}} of a line carved into the interior of <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> and a small vertical pipe {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> that leads to the bottom. The height of this pipe {{is the same as the}} line carved into the interior of <b>the</b> <b>cup.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cup</b> may be filled to the line without any fluid passing into the pipe in the center of <b>the</b> <b>cup.</b> However, when <b>the</b> amount of fluid exceeds this fill line, fluid will overflow into the pipe in the center of <b>the</b> <b>cup.</b> Due to <b>the</b> drag that molecules exert on one another, <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> will be emptied.|$|R

25|$|In rotary parlors, {{the cows}} are loaded {{one at a}} time onto the {{platform}} as it rotates. The milker stands near the entry to the parlor and puts <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> on the cows as they move past. By the time the platform has completed almost a full rotation, another milker or a machine removes <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> and the cow steps backwards off the platform and then walks to its feed. Rotary cowsheds, as they are called in New Zealand, started in the 1980s but are expensive compared to Herringbone cowshed - the older New Zealand norm.|$|E

50|$|The {{working face}} of <b>the</b> suction <b>cup</b> {{is made of}} elastic, {{flexible}} material and has a curved surface. When the center of <b>the</b> suction <b>cup</b> is pressed against a flat, non-porous surface, {{the volume of the}} space between <b>the</b> suction <b>cup</b> and <b>the</b> flat surface is reduced, which causes the air or water between <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> and <b>the</b> surface to be expelled past the rim of <b>the</b> circular <b>cup.</b> <b>The</b> cavity which develops between <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> and <b>the</b> flat surface has little to no air or water in it because most of the fluid has already been forced out of the inside of <b>the</b> <b>cup,</b> causing a lack of pressure. The pressure difference between the atmosphere on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> and <b>the</b> low-pressure cavity on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> keeps <b>the</b> <b>cup</b> adhered to <b>the</b> surface.|$|R

25|$|Before shooting, teams may dunk the ping pong balls into cups {{of water}} in order to wash off the balls. However, {{research}} has shown that the wash cups can still hold bacteria such as E. coli. To avoid any illness, many players put water in <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> instead of beer, keeping a separate beer on the side to drink from. In doing so, it removes the possibility of getting sick or drinking any dirt that may transfer from the ball into the cup.|$|E

25|$|Bra-sizing in the United States and Canada is {{very similar}} to the United Kingdom. Band sizes use the same {{designation}} in inches and <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> also increase by 1-inch-steps. However, some manufacturers use conflicting sizing methods. Some label bras beyond a C cup as D-DD-DDD-DDDD-E-EE-EEE-EEEE-F…, some use the variation: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5..... but many use the following system: A, B, C, D, DD, DDD, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. and others label them like the British system D-DD-E-F-FF… Comparing the larger cup sizes between different manufacturers can be difficult.|$|E
25|$|The Vilna Gaon {{relates the}} Four Cups to four worlds: this world, the Messianic age, {{the world at}} the revival of the dead, and the world to come. The MaHaRaL connects them to the four Matriarchs: Sarah, Rebeccah, Rachel, and Leah. (The three matzot, in turn, are {{connected}} to the three Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) Abarbanel relates <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> to the four historical redemptions of the Jewish people: the choosing of Abraham, the Exodus from Egypt, the survival of the Jewish people throughout the exile, and the fourth which will happen at the end of days.|$|E
25|$|Crank pin and {{crosshead}} bearings carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|E

25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. <b>The</b> <b>cups</b> are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. One of the biggest challenges is trying to keep it in one piece.|$|E

He played seven games for St Mirren that season, failing to score, before retiring as a player at the age of 35. In a professional career which had stretched for 15 years, he managed a total of 136 goals in the English and Scottish leagues, combined with many more in <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> and also in Europe for Celtic.|$|E
25|$|If {{the straps}} {{dig into the}} {{shoulder}}, leaving red marks or causing shoulder or neck pain, the bra band is not offering enough support. If breast tissue overflows {{the bottom of the}} bra, under the armpit, or over the top edge of the bra cup, the cup size is too small. Loose fabric in the bra cup indicates the cup size is too big. If the underwires poke the breast under the armpit or if the bra's center panel does not lie flat against the sternum, the cup size is too small. If the band rides up the torso at the back, the band size is too big. If it digs into the flesh, causing the flesh to spill over the edges of the band, the band is too small. If the band feels tight, {{this may be due to}} <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> being too small; instead of going up in band size a person should try going up in cup size. Similarly a band might feel too loose if the cup is too big. It is possible to test whether a bra band is too tight or too loose by reversing the bra on her torso so that <b>the</b> <b>cups</b> are at the back and then check for fit and comfort. Generally, if the wearer must continually adjust the bra or experiences general discomfort, the bra is a poor fit and she should get a new fitting.|$|E
