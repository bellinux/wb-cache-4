40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} task in information access methods is distinguishing factual information from speculative or negated information. Fine-grained certainty levels of diagnostic statements in Swedish clinical text are annotated in a corpus {{from a medical}} university hospital. The annotation model has two polarities (positive and negative) and <b>three</b> <b>certainty</b> levels. However, there are many e-health scenarios where such fine-grained certainty levels are not practical for information extraction. Instead, more coarse-grained groups are needed. We present three scenarios: adverse event surveillance, decision support alerts and automatic summaries and collapse the fine-grained certainty level classifications into coarser-grained groups. We build automatic classifiers for each scenario and analyze the results quantitatively. Annotation discrepancies are analyzed qualitatively through manual corpus analysis. Our main findings are that it is feasible to use a corpus of fine-grained certainty level annotations to build classifiers for coarser-grained real-world scenarios: 0. 89, 0. 91 and 0. 8 F-score (overall average) ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To adjust patients' time {{trade-off}} (TTO) scores {{using information}} on their utility functions for survival time to derive a measure of health state utility equivalent to the standard gamble (SG).

RESULTS: Patient's utility functions for time were increasingly concave, but being unable to model this successfully, a constant function with an averaged level of concavity was used. The raw TTO scores {{were significantly higher than}} SG scores, while the adjusted TTO scores were equivalent to the SG. CONCLUSIONS: Raw time trade-off scores will give biased estimates of health state utility when patients' utility functions for time are not linear, but these can be adjusted to yield true utilities. The constant proportional risk-posture assumption of the conventional QALY model, on which previous attempts to adjust time trade-offs have been based, was not supported by the data...|$|R

These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land.

500|$|The <b>three</b> <b>certainties</b> {{refer to}} a rule within English trusts law on the {{creation}} of express trusts that, to be valid, the trust instrument must show certainty of intention, subject matter and object. [...] "Certainty of intention" [...] means that it must be clear that the donor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the donor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. [...] "Certainty of subject matter" [...] means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. [...] "Certainty of objects" [...] means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the residuary legatee. Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under <b>three</b> <b>certainties</b> rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not a question for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the last}} <b>three</b> decades, the <b>certainty</b> {{equivalence}} principle {{has been the}} funda-mental paradigm {{in the design of}} adaptive control laws. It is well known, however, that for general control criterions the performance achieved through its use is strictly suboptimal. In order to over-come this difficulty, two different approaches have been proposed: i) the use of cost-biased parameter estimators; and ii) the injection of probing signals into the system so as to enforce consistency in the parameter estimate. This paper presents an overview of the cost-biased approach. New insight is achieved in this paper by the formalization of a general cost-biased principle named “Bet On the Best”-BOB.

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{reveals that the}} virtual reconstructions 01 cultural heritage made using computer graphics techniques, often lack scientific rigor and lose sight 01 existing knowledge. AlI too often, the criteria used lar recons truction are not accessible, there is no transparencyregarding the process, nor is there an analysis olthe validityolthe recons truction hypothesis, even when the modeling is carried out by scientists. Against this background, I lormulated the lollowing hypothesis : "One can develop a method by which scientific rigor is brought to architectural virtual reconstructions, relevant to Roman architecture and cons idering the cultural heritage in its historical landscape". The methodology I developed to test my hypothesis is organized in 3 steps : 1. Documentation and data collection. 2. Development 01 the virtual model on a urban scale. 3. Produ ction 01 a detailed photo-realistic models olthe monument. In the 3 rd phase, we propose solutions to every detail that defines the architectural building in an iterative way. In this last phase are also embedded the techniques to studythe stabilityolthe construction elements such as walls (isolated or as carriers 01 arcs), arcs (symmetric and asymmetric load) and vaults. By analyzing the stabilityolthe wall, the method allow to check the stability olthe stirrups, while the study 01 arcs is {{used to determine the}} line 01 thrust at the bow to check their stability. Regarding data transparency, the reconstruction hypotheses are classified according to 31 evels, depending on the reliability olthe underpinning data, namely: confirmed, probable and hypothetical. The reliabilityolthe reconstruction is indicated in each case. The models produced according to this method are accessible, can be searched lor background data and assumptions, display areas 01 uncertainty, and can be easily modified as new data is made available. To test the method, I applied it to produce the virtual reconstruction 01 the Villa 01 Livia, the first imperial residence projected as a country residence and designed with a strong symbolic valence: des pite its apparent simplicity it revealed the political and artistic conception olthe Emperor Augustus and summarized the essence 01 Roman architecture, combining the aomestic and lunctional architecture with representative lunctions. The confidence in the proposed elements olthe reconstruction is indicated bya legend that differentiates the <b>three</b> <b>certainty</b> levels lor both, the decorative elem ents and the structure. To evaluate the correctness olthe 3 D model, I first analyzed the structural behavior 01 part 01 the Villa using the MIDAS/Gen software. A task that proved extremelycomplex and ineflicient. I thus generated atable that displays the parameters that have been used to generate the virtual model, and that allows to check elements such as constructive structure 01 decks, dimensions, slopes, water evacuation systems, presence 01 eaves, thickness olwalls, dimensions 01 pillars, type 01 Coatings, paving, windows and carpentry, among others. This exercise altowed to validate myinitial hypothesis. The method I developed is valid lor architectural heritage characterized by strong codes, such as the Roman architecture that was codified since Imperial times. However, it can also be used in other cases ofhistoric buildings, since the static and constructive checks and data transparency approach built in the method are relevant to all the historic architecture, until the emergence ofmodern materials.

This is: [...] It will be convenient to call the person on whom such a trust is imposed the 'primary donee', and the beneficiary under that trust the 'secondary donee'. The essential elements which must be proved to exist are: (i) the intention of the testator to subject the primary donee to an obligation in favour of the secondary donee; (ii) communication of that intention to the primary donee; and (iii) the acceptance of that obligation by the primary donee either expressly or by acquiescence.

The <b>certainty</b> function varied from 1. 0 (perfectly classified) to 0. 0 (random). From each lesion, 180 +/- 22 nuclei were imaged. Overall classification accuracy was 89. 6 % with six unique nuclear features. No CP cases were misclassified, 1 / 16 IPMN cases were misclassified, and 4 / 16 PC cases were misclassified. Certainty function was 0. 75 +/- 0. 16 for correctly classified lesions and 0. 47 +/- 0. 10 for incorrectly classified lesions (P = 0. 0005). Uncertainty was identified in four of the five misclassified lesions. Quantitative histopathology provides a robust, novel method to distinguish among CP, IPMN, and PC with a quantitative measure of uncertainty. This may be useful when there is uncertainty in diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of histidine {{has been}} investigated using a series of histidine requiring mutants of Neurospora and Penicillium. A general method is given for the isolation {{of a number of}} imidazole derivatives that are accumulated by these mutants. Methods of degradation and chromatography have been used to identify with reasonable <b>certainty</b> <b>three</b> crystalline products as 4 -(D-erythro-trihydroxypropyl) -imidazole, 4 -(2 -keto- 3 -hydroxypropyl) -imidazole and L- 4 -(2 -amino- 3 -hydroxypropyl) -imidazole (L-histidinol). Evidence is presented to show that two other non-crystalline products are phosphate esters of the trihydroxy and the ketohydroxy compounds. Chromatographic evidence is presented which indicates two other compounds are imidazole acetic acid and 4 -(2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl) -imidazole. A chemical synthesis of isomers of 4 -(trihydroxypropyl) -imizadole is described. The trihydroxy, ketohydroxy, and aminohydroxy compounds have been placed in that order leading to histidine, {{on the basis of the}} sequence of the mutants and the accumulations by the double mutants. Evidence is discussed suggesting that the phosphate esters of these compounds are more likely to be the true precursors of histidine. A scheme is postulated for the relation of all these substances to histidine synthesis and the possibility that a pentose- 5 -phosphate may be an early precursor of histidine is discussed. A method for the paper chromatography of imidazoles is presented and the Rf values of numerous synthetic derivatives are given...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{changes in}} the STIS {{sensitivity}} are revealed by 2. 3 years of observations of the same standard stars in the 52 X 2 arcsec slit. The largest changes are in G 140 L, where the sensitivity depends on both the time and temperature. The minor effect is a- 0. 25 %/C temperature correlation, where {{the bulk of the}} observations are confined to the 34. 5 - 38. 5 C temperature range. No significant change with temperature is detected for the near-UV MAMA or CCD modes. Following a correction for the correlation with temperature, the sensitivity of G 140 L decreases linearly with time. These losses vary with wavelength, ranging from a minimum of- 0. 8 %/yr at 1325 Å to a maximum of- 2. 8 %/yr at 1575 Å. For G 230 L, the mean sensitivity over all wavelengths increases by an average of 1. 8 % in the first 1. 3 years and then begins to drop. Two straight lines with different slopes fit the observed changes. The changes before 1998. 7 also vary with wavelength, ranging from a minimum of + 0. 8 %/yr at 2550 to a maximum at 2250 Å of + 2. 1 %/yr. The wavelength-dependent slopes of the currently decreasing sensitivity range from zero at the short wavelength end of the band to- 1. 9 %/yr in the 2300 - 2400 Å interval. Changes in the three low dispersion CCD modes are less severe. For G 230 LB and G 750 L, most wavelength bins are consistent within a three σ uncertainty of constant sensitivity over time. Only one wavelength bin for G 230 LB and two for G 750 L show sensitivity losses with more than <b>three</b> σ <b>certainty.</b> Those changes are small and lie in the 0. 2 - 0. 4 %/yr range. However for G 430 L, the losses in every 200 Å wavelength bin beyond 3300 Å range from 0. 5 to 0. 7 %/yr with a high statistical significance of 2 - 9 σ. After correcting the three low-dispersion modes for sensitivity changes, the 1 σ photometric broadband repeatability ranges from 0. 2 % for G 140 L and G 750 L to 0. 4 % for spectrophotometry in the other 3 modes...|$|R
