5|$|On 13 April 1948, {{the goods}} hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine {{dropped into the}} hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. The driver and fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal and used for spares.|$|E
5|$|Simons Wrecking Company No. 2 is a H.K. Porter, 0-6-0T {{steam engine}} built in 1941. The <b>tank</b> <b>engine,</b> which is oil fired, {{worked for the}} US Navy during World War II in Virginia as #14. Later the engine was put into service with Simons Wrecking Co. as No. 2.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the SECR Kclass 2-6-4 passenger <b>tank</b> <b>engine,</b> also by Maunsell. It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and {{provided the basis for}} the 3-cylinder N1class of 1922. Production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the first Nclass rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917, three years after design work was completed. The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECR's fleet standardisation, as they used parts interchangeable with those of other classes.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} included Holden 2-4-2T <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> and Hill 0-6-2T <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> {{built by}} the GER, and carriages were usually of the short wheelbase type, up to 16 per train.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{locomotives}} were 4-4-0 <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> {{for passenger}} trains and 0-6-0 <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> for goods trains. Later some smaller locomotives were purchased for branch {{lines and the}} dock branches.|$|R
50|$|Beyer Peacock {{provided}} forty one 2-4-0 steam locomotives for {{the railway}} in 1861 and 1862, followed by eight 4-4-0 <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b> One {{of the later}} <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> is preserved outside Bilbao Abando railway station.|$|R
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} aircraft engines of the World War II era, some fifty marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester. A de-rated version was also the basis of the very successful Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor <b>tank</b> <b>engine.</b> Post-war, the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls-Royce Griffon for military use, with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft. Production ceased in 1956 with the fulfilment of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's CASA 2.111 and Hispano Aviación HA-1112 aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the Packard V-1650 was a version of the Merlin built in the United States, itself produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E
5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
50|$|The NZR’s Addington Workshops {{joined the}} list of Prairie {{suppliers}} in 1889, producing {{the first of two}} NZR W class <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b> These were followed between 1892 and 1901 with eleven similar NZR WA class <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Stroudley’s {{successor}} R. J. Billinton {{continued the}} process of standardisation of locomotive parts {{until his death in}} 1904, thereby reducing maintenance costs. He introduced 8-wheeled designs in the form of 4-4-0 express locomotives and a very successful series of 0-6-2 <b>tank</b> <b>engines</b> with radial axles. D.E. Marsh continued {{the process of}} building larger locomotives with two classes of 4-4-2 express passenger locomotives, four classes of 4-4-2 <b>tank</b> <b>engines,</b> and two classes of 4-6-2 <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Further {{production}} was reputedly on hold {{due to lack}} of <b>tank</b> <b>engines,</b> with Ukraine first refusing to provide engines, but later promising to deliver 110 new <b>tank</b> <b>engines.</b> According to news reports, since the political instability, Ukraine is facing issues in making deliveries of equipment.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 <b>tank</b> <b>engine,</b> even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E

Awdry constructed a toy <b>tank</b> <b>engine</b> for Christopher, which gained the name Thomas. Stories about Thomas were requested by Christopher, and 1946 saw the publication of Thomas the <b>Tank</b> <b>Engine.</b> This was illustrated by Reginald Payne, whom Wilbert felt to be a great improvement over Middleton. Like its predecessor, this book was a success and Awdry was asked to write stories about James, a character who first appeared in Thomas and the Breakdown Train, the final story in Thomas the <b>Tank</b> <b>Engine.</b> The book James the Red Engine appeared in 1948, the year in which the railways in Britain were nationalised, and from this point onwards the Fat Director was known by his familiar title of the Fat Controller.|$|E
