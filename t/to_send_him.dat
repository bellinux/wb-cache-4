5|$|Although {{his work}} took him from Silverton, for the {{remainder}} of his life, Davenport was often melancholy for his native Oregon, and in writing to relatives there, he repeatedly told them not <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> anything that would remind him of Silverton, because he would be plunged into despair.|$|E
5|$|Francis, {{convinced}} that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, they agreed and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June.|$|E
50|$|Concern {{about his}} range caused the Dodgers {{to move him}} from shortstop to third base prior <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> their rookie league team, the Ogden Raptors, {{for the last few}} games of the 2003 season.|$|R

5|$|In 1873, Tesla {{returned}} to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden {{for nine months}} and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, {{in a moment of}} despair, (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood) promised <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.|$|E
5|$|Stafford blames Arab nationalists, most {{prominently}} Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and Bakr Sidqi. According to him, Iraqi Army officers despised the Assyrians, and Sidqi {{in particular was}} vocal of his hate for them. This view was also shared by British officials who recommended to Faysal not <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to the north during the crisis.|$|E
5|$|When {{the truce}} expired in 552, Thurisind and Audoin again {{took to the}} field, {{and this time the}} clash was unavoidable. Audoin had reached an {{agreement}} with Justinian by which the Byzantines promised <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> military support in exchange for the 5,500 Lombards sent to help the Byzantine general Narses in the Emperor's war in Italy.|$|E
60|$|Talking about eddication, {{said the}} night-watchman, thoughtfully, the finest eddication {{you can give}} a lad is <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>'im</b> <b>to</b> sea. School is all right {{up to a certain}} p'int, but arter that comes the sea. I've been there myself and I know wot I'm talking about. All that I am I owe to 'aving been to sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Service!" [...] {{shouted the}} angry Bonnet. But {{as it was}} of no use to say {{anything}} more upon this subject, he ordered the sailing-master <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> first, Ben Greenway, and then to summon to him, {{no matter where they}} might be or what they might be doing, the whole crew.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Prince. Do listen, Marion. The Prince of this island, His Highness, the Prince of Mervo. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>send</b> for <b>him</b> {{and put him}} on {{the throne}} again." ...|$|R
5|$|Without their assistance, Beng Soon and {{his friends}} are punished for {{producing}} substandard homework. Although the boys try to resolve their differences, they eventually give up on reaching an agreement. Beng Soon's grades continue to fall, and his parents decide <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> away to study in England.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} that Edwin died in 633, {{a member of the}} East Anglian royal family, Sigeberht, {{returned}} to Britain after his conversion while in exile in Francia. He asked Honorius, one of the Gregorian missionaries who was then Archbishop of Canterbury, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> a bishop, and Honorius sent Felix of Burgundy, who was already a consecrated bishop; Felix succeeded in converting the East Angles.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his schooling in Punjab {{and at the}} Sherwood College, Nainital, he achieved a distinction in the School Certificate of the Cambridge Board, an English language curriculum developed by the University of Cambridge International Examinations, {{at the age of}} 15. He asked his father <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to London to become a gynaecologist. But his father refused, stating that he was not old enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "The best means, sire, to {{put your}} life in security, is <b>to</b> <b>send</b> for <b>him</b> at once, and to cut off his head {{directly}} he comes," [...] said the vizir.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose I did. I know Otis Harvey--or used <b>to.</b> I'd <b>send</b> <b>him</b> a wire, and he'd {{understand}} {{it was a}} ground-hog case with me. That's exactly what I told this British fossil company here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The lad {{has fallen}} {{on his feet}} somehow," [...] he said, [...] "and he is better where he is than he would be with me. I suppose when he wants money he will write and say so, though where I should get any <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> I know not. Anyhow, I need not worry about him at present." ...|$|R
5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> and the nanny away. The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1768 {{the family}} finally took up {{residence}} in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together the money <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age {{at a time}} when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E
5000|$|Naoto Kurogane (voiced by: Nobunaga Shimazaki): The main {{protagonist of}} Bloodedge Experience. He appears in Central Fiction due <b>to</b> Raquel <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> {{into the current}} {{timeline}} of BlazBlue where he died apparently to save their world.|$|R
6000|$|... "General Olaf, of my guard," [...] she answered, [...] "Governor of the State Prison. You remember, you wished me <b>to</b> <b>send</b> for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{settle the}} point {{as to which}} we were arguing." ...|$|R
50|$|He later {{experienced}} {{his first}} taste of senior football with Leeds when he was included in Simon Grayson's squad for the pre-season friendly tour of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and featured in the matches against Shelbourne and Glentoran. With senior central defenders Rui Marques, Patrick Kisnorbo, Richard Naylor, Lubomir Michalik, Leigh Bromby and Paul Huntington also in the first team squad, Lees found his opportunities limited for the 2009-10 season with the club looking <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> out on loan to gain experience.|$|R
5|$|An old blind woman, {{who came}} to listen and give the boy advice, told his father of Fauré's gift for music. In 1853 Simon-Lucien Dufaur de Saubiac, of the National Assembly, heard Fauré play and advised Toussaint-Honoré <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse (School of Classical and Religious Music, {{better known as the}} , which Louis Niedermeyer was setting up in Paris. After {{reflecting}} for a year, Fauré's father agreed and took the nine-year-old boy to Paris in October 1854.|$|E
5|$|From the age {{of about}} twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Greek and {{probably}} imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school, and by October 1659, {{he was to be}} found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. Newton hated farming. Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, persuaded his mother <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> back to school so that he might complete his education. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{exclusive}} {{access to the}} King provoked {{several members of the}} nobility, and in 1307 the King was again forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> into exile. During this absence he served as the King's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Edward managed to negotiate a deal with the opposition, however, and Gaveston returned the next year. Upon his return his behaviour became even more offensive, and by the Ordinances of 1311 it was decided that Gaveston should be exiled for a third time, to suffer outlawry if he returned. When he did return in 1312, he was hunted down and executed by a group of magnates led by Thomas of Lancaster and Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No; he went round that way, {{and sent}} Brown home. He {{said he should}} be here by dinner-time, {{but it is very}} late. Is it not a strange {{proceeding}} of hers, <b>to</b> be <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> about the country!' ...|$|R
60|$|The Secretary stated to the {{schoolmaster}} how {{the object}} was, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for certain occasional evening instruction, a youth whom Mr and Mrs Boffin wished {{to help to}} an industrious and useful place in life. The schoolmaster was willing to undertake the charge of such a pupil. The Secretary inquired on what terms? The schoolmaster stated on what terms. Agreed and disposed of.|$|R
5|$|Harsha later {{visits a}} water {{bottling}} unit {{which not only}} produces alcoholic beverages but also draws from the village's source of drinking water. He tries to close it, but is attacked by Sashi's henchmen and is hospitalised. Ravikanth, who has been informed of Harsha's adoption of Devarakota, manages to bring Harsha back to Hyderabad, where he joins the office after he recovers. Ravikanth later confronts a visibly upset Harsha and decides <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> back to Devarakota, earning Harsha's love, for which he has long yearned. Harsha hands over the reigns of the business empire to Karthik and leaves.|$|E
5|$|In America, Angier meets {{scientist}} Nikola Tesla {{and asks}} him to build him the machine Tesla built for Borden. While waiting for Tesla to finish, Angier deciphers Borden's diary, which he discovers to be fraudulent: Borden confesses that Tesla {{has nothing to}} do with Borden's trick and that Borden ordered Olivia to give Angier the diary <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> away. Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects a distance from the machine. As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E
5|$|Offensive {{additions}} included halfback Ara Parseghian {{and quarterback}} George Terlep, {{but the most}} significant signing {{of the year was}} Dub Jones. Brown got Jones – who had a long and successful career in Cleveland – in a trade with the Brooklyn Dodgers for the rights to draft Bob Chappuis. Author Andy Piasick describes this trade {{as one of the most}} astute in Browns history. The Browns also signed quarterback Y. A. Tittle from Louisiana State University, but were forced <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>him</b> to the Baltimore Colts as part of an effort to balance talent among the AAFC's teams during the league's third year of play.|$|E
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{or speak}} to him first if I should see him, {{so as to be}} known to him, that I {{resolved}} not to do, if I died for it. To watch him about his lodging, that was as much below my spirit as the other. So that, in a word, I was at a perfect loss how to act or what to do.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} Monday, Colbert finally {{responded to}} Stewart, first mocking {{him for his}} facial hair, then responding to the [...] "brain-cam" [...] with his own [...] "gut-cam." [...] Colbert then brought up the online rally and how viewers were <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> toy geese and releasing doves outside his studio, finally asking people <b>to</b> stop <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> live animals.|$|R
50|$|Two Australian {{soap operas}} have named fictional {{characters}} Dave Gorman as an in-joke and the comedian has been bombarded {{with so many}} e-mails about it {{that he has had}} to publicly appeal to people <b>to</b> stop <b>sending</b> <b>him</b> details of other Dave Gormans.|$|R
