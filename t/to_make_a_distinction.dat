5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore {{the integrity of the}} wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E

It is necessary therefore <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between the two situations. The former ones will belong to the dynamic micelles while the latter will be called kinetically frozen micelles.|$|E

25|$|Paeonia corallina is {{a synonym}} of Paeonia mascula, so cannot {{be applied to}} the taxa of P. daurica. According to the most recent taxonomic review of this complex of taxa, no {{morphological}} differences occur that are distinct enough to recognize separate species.

25|$|Allergies to sulfonamide are common. According to data {{the overall}} {{incidence}} of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully. It is important <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between sulfa drugs and other sulfur-containing drugs and additives, such as sulfates and sulfites, which are chemically {{unrelated to the}} sulfonamide group, and do not cause the same hypersensitivity reactions seen in the sulfonamides.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1916, {{the type}} was called Schneider CA 1 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> with a derived tank project, the Schneider CA 2. In 1917 the Schneider CA 1 is also called the Schneider 1916 to {{distinguish}} it from the Schneider 1917, {{another name for the}} next tank project, the Schneider CA 3. This had its origin in a demand by Estienne on 30 January 1917 to agree on a standardised terminology. General Mourret then proposed to use the official designations Schneider Modèle 1916 and Saint-Chamond Modèle 1916.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} this device {{is most likely}} is the Greek Byzantium. Many {{credible}} references {{can be found in}} medieval texts.

However, it must be kept in mind that the principle of axial flow was well known in the Islamic world since 9th century when it was attested by the Banu Musa brothers who, in their Kitab al-hiyal (Book of Ingenious Devices) written in Baghdad in about 850 CE described a horizontal wheel placed in one of their fountains and driven from below by a number of vertical jets of water.|$|E

25|$|The {{method used}} in Hereditary Genius has been {{described}} as the first example of historiometry. To bolster these results, and to attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a questionnaire that he sent out to 190 Fellows of the Royal Society. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as birth order and the occupation and race of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, English men of science: their nature and nurture, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the nature versus nurture question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.|$|E
25|$|Inductive {{learning}} {{problem can}} occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous {{situations in which}} there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as {{they may not be able}} to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that a way <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{pre-operative}} {{assessment of}} patients has turned more patient-goal oriented. This {{means that the}} patients are asked to define their goals before surgery. In order to evaluate this the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was developed. This test {{is based on the}} World Health Organisation's framework of measuring health and disability: The International Classification of Function(ICF): This framework measures health and disability by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Functional deﬁcits can be measured according to the level of loss of structure and function, the level of activity limitations, and the level of restriction in social participation. Reaching or gripping represents the integration of strength, sensation and range of motion, and therefore occur at the individual level rather than at the organ system level. For this reason, reaching and gripping are on the ICF level of activities. However, this level includes a broad range of activities, from basic activities (for example grasping and moving objects) to complex activities (such as dressing, grooming). It is useful <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between basic activities and complex activities.|$|E

25|$|It is however {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>distinction</b> {{in religious}} denominations: {{the majority of}} the Poles were Latin Catholics, while the Ruthenians were mostly Greek Catholics.

500|$|According to Abbo, Edmund was [...] "ex antiquorum Saxonum nobili prosapia oriundus". This {{statement}} has confused later translators {{into thinking}} that Edmund was of continental Old Saxon origin. However the historian Steven Plunkett notes that Abbo, describing the Migration Age settlement of the East Anglian region (Eastengle) {{at the opening of}} his work, attributed that occupation to 'Saxons' (the Jutes and Angles going elsewhere): therefore by {{the use of the term}} 'of the noble lineage of the old Saxons' for Edmund, he was not attempting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between Edmund's own ancestry and that of the people over whom he ruled.|$|E
500|$|Terence Blanchard {{composed}} the film score, marking his twelfth collaboration with Lee. For the score, he attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between American and German soldiers. [...] "That was first done {{through the use}} of percussion, using a higher-pitched, tighter sound for Germans, and a fuller-field drum sound for Americans," [...] he explained. [...] "I also drew a distinction by using French horns for American forces, and a Wagner tuben for German forces." [...] Scoring the film required the use of a 90-piece orchestra, which was larger than in any of Lee's previous films. [...] Blanchard also relied on the use of instruments from the 1940s era, including a mandolin, accordion, slide guitar and rope drum.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom was {{the first}} {{government}} to attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinction</b> between Hezbollah's political and military wings, declaring the latter a terrorist group in July 2008 after Hezbollah confirmed its association with Imad Mughniyeh. In 2012, British [...] "Foreign Minister William Hague urged the European Union to place Hezbollah's military wing on its list of terrorist organizations." [...] The United States also urged the EU to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. In light of findings implicating Hezbollah in the bus bombing in Burgas, Bulgaria in 2012, there was renewed discussion within the European Union to label Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group. On 22 July 2013, the European Union agreed to blacklist Hezbollah's military wing over concerns about its growing role in the Syrian conflict.|$|E
