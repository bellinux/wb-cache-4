Kennedy the previous day. It {{was to be a}} regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of <b>transmission</b> <b>length.</b> Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along {{with the head of the}} script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode [...] "Human Nature", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity. The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any [...] "bug-eyed monsters". According to producer Verity Lambert; [...] "We didn't have a lot of choice— we only had the Dalek serial to go... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [...] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that." [...] Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial– The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common type of lag is caused by network {{performance}} problems. Losses, corruption or jitter (an outdated packet is in effect a loss) may all cause problems, but these problems are relatively rare in a network with sufficient bandwidth and no or little congestion. Instead, the latency involved in transmitting data between clients and server plays a significant role. Latency varies depending on a number of factors, such as the physical distance between the end-systems, as a longer distance means additional <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> and routing required and therefore higher latency. Routing over the Internet may be extremely indirect, resulting in far more <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> (and consequent latency) than a direct route, although the cloud gaming service OnLive has developed a solution to this issue by establishing peering relationships with multiple Tier 1 network Internet Service Providers and choosing an optimal route between server and user. In addition, insufficient bandwidth and congestion, even if not severe enough to cause losses, may cause additional delays regardless of distance. As with the hardware issues, packets that arrive slowly or not at all will make both the client and server unable to update the game state in a timely manner.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discussed}} about {{radio frequency}} design of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) based p-matched shunt switch for broad-band (18 - 40 GHz) application. The effects {{of variation in}} membrane width (50 – 80 µm) of the switch and high-impedance <b>transmission</b> line <b>length</b> (200 – 600 µm) between the switch structures on scattering parameters are studied. The variation in beam width has very little effect on return loss and insertion loss of the switch in the up-state. The reduction in high- impedance <b>transmission</b> line <b>length</b> yields marginally improved return loss and insertion loss. In the down-state configuration, the return loss showed negligible change with the variation in beam width and high-impedance <b>transmission</b> line <b>lengths.</b> The isolation {{is found to be}} improved with the increase in beam width and high-impedance <b>transmission</b> line <b>length</b> in whole frequency range.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} and localization of classical waves in one-dimensional disordered structures composed of alternating layers of left- and right-handed materials (mixed stacks) and {{compare them to}} the structures composed of different layers of the same material (homogeneous stacks). For weakly scattering layers, we have developed an effective analytical approach and have calculated the <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> within a wide region of the input parameters. When both refractive index and layer thickness of a mixed stack are random, the <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> in the long-wave range of the localized regime exhibits a quadratic power wavelength dependence with the coefficients different for mixed and homogeneous stacks. Moreover, the <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> of a mixed stack differs from reciprocal of the Lyapunov exponent of the corresponding infinite stack. In both the ballistic regime of a mixed stack and in the near long-wave region of a homogeneous stack, the <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> of a realization is a strongly fluctuating quantity. In the far long-wave part of the ballistic region, the homogeneous stack becomes effectively uniform and the <b>transmission</b> <b>length</b> fluctuations are weaker.

In mixed stacks with only refractive-index disorder, Anderson localization at long wavelengths is substantially suppressed, with the localization length growing with the wavelength much faster than for homogeneous stacks. The crossover region becomes essentially wider and transmission resonances appear only in much longer stacks.

40|$|Design of {{experiment}} {{is a method}} where the relation between input factors and outputs can be studied. In practice, a number {{of experiment}}s are conducted and the input(s) are changed between each experiment. Gained information can then be used {{to find out how}} to improve the process under study. It is applicable to many areas from cooking to radio frequency (RF) simulations. This thesis focuses on the effects of <b>transmission</b> line <b>lengths</b> and their effect to different RF parameters. Study is applied to a long term evolution frequency division duplexing (LTE-FDD) mobile front end. The purpose is to find out the applicability of DOE to RF design process. To be able to start final simulations it is required that layout is completed. When layout is finished, accurate parameter values can be used to receive reliable results. For example, <b>transmission</b> line <b>lengths</b> are acquired from the layout. However, there may be situations where the layout is not entirely finished. Therefore, it would be an advantage if limits for the <b>length</b> of a <b>transmission</b> line <b>length</b> could be defined without compromising reliability. In this thesis DOE is applied to search for suitable limits for the <b>transmission</b> line <b>lengths.</b> If applicable boundaries are found, simulations could be done before layout is completed. To find out the acceptable boundaries, existing simulation models are used to study the effects of <b>transmission</b> line <b>lengths</b> to different RF parameters. Chosen transmission lines are then varied in length with desired limits. Acquired results, using the limits, are then compared to a nominal case, where no transmission line variation is done. A set of different percentual limits are used. Studied RF parameters are insertion loss and return losses in each port. DOE was utilized on two RF (LTE-FDD) front ends. LTE-FDD bands 2 and 12 were chosen to cover two unique cases. Though only LTE-FDD front ends are investigated, the information received could also be applied on other RF transmission lines in other types of front end, such as GSM or WCDMA front ends. ii The study revealed that DOE can be used as tool to evaluate whether a <b>transmission</b> line <b>length,</b> within a limit, is applicable to continue simulation process. In some situations the case might be that no applicable limit is found. If the limit is not usable, simulation process cannot be continued without compromising the accuracy of the results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—One {{advantage}} of incremental transmissions with feedback in point-to-point memoryless channels is {{a reduction in}} average blocklength required to approach capacity. This paper optimizes the size of each incremental transmission for non-binary (NB) LDPC codes to maximize throughput in VLFT and two-phase VLF settings. The optimization problem uses an approximation based on the inverse-Gaussian p. d. f. of the block-length required for successful decoding. By using the optimized incremental <b>transmission</b> <b>lengths</b> (with an average blocklength of less than 500 bits), NB-LDPC codes for VLFT setting limited to 5 transmissions achieve a throughput greater than 96 % of that obtained by an unlimited-transmission VLFT scheme with the same average blocklength.

40|$|Abstract- Interest in Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) {{technology}} has been increasing worldwide recently. This trend is proved by commercialized products such as electric toothbrush, wireless razor, and wireless charger for mobile phone battery. Studies for enhancing {{the applicability of the}} technology have been continuously conducted. Currently the WPT technology is based on the technologies using microwave, inductively coupling, and magnetic resonance. In the meantime, development of the microwave-based WPT faces difficulty due to health hazards involved in the technology, and application of the WPT technology using inductively coupling is restricted by area due to the problem of <b>transmission</b> <b>length.</b> In comparison, the WPT technology using magnetic resonance draws attention in terms of efficiency and <b>transmission</b> <b>length.</b> In this study, the sending coil based on the WPT technology using magnetic resonance system was replaced with an HTS coil to enhance transmission efficiency.

Distinct features of VLS include the utilization of variable <b>transmission</b> <b>lengths</b> based on distributed observations, compatibility with 802. 11 ’s contention window algorithm, opportunistic scheduling to achieve high throughput under noisy and time-varying wireless channel conditions, and flexibility and ease of implementation.

Only for short distances the state-dependent teleportation fidelity can be close to unity.

Experimental results show that, for the SI-POF lengths longer than 50 m, the proposed PN-PAM transmission scheme outperforms the classical PAM transmission with DFE equalization {{as well as the}} DMT transmissions that has been optimized in a previous work [19]. In the meantime, for the <b>transmission</b> <b>lengths</b> shorter than 50 m, the proposed PN-PAM transmission scheme performs better than the classical PAM with DFE equalization but worse than the DMT transmissions. This degradation can be understood by the fact that in order to achieve the same transmission rate as DMT, the PN-PAM based systems need to employ higher order modulations when the channel condition is good. However, the higher order modulations are more vulnerable to the non-linearity of the SI-POF system.|$|R
30|$|In addition, for the <b>{{transmission}}</b> <b>length</b> {{shorter than}} 50 m, the DMT systems present better performance.

However, when high order PAM modulations are employed for short range communications, the transmitter non-linearity distortion will seriously affect overall performance.|$|E
