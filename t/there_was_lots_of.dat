500|$|The {{recording}} was {{engineered by}} Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Goldstein was [...] hired to mix B'Day. He said: [...] "This song was really simple to mix. It {{was produced by}} Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> room for all the instruments." [...] Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander [...] "to sweeten the sound" [...] and to give them [...] "a little bit more spread". Goldstein thought [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] sounded [...] "a bit old-school"; an eighth note delay echo {{was placed on the}} song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.|$|E
500|$|Business {{continued}} to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded. Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg, who was selling his T-shirt business so {{he would be able}} to afford the cost of the store. The co-owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff. Cohen and Meade set him up in a part-time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members. Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after he kissed an employee on her birthday. The three co-owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign, and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium. Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "We all started with good motives, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> naiveté on all sides." [...] In 2006, a year after the botched sale attempt, Cohen and Meade both decided to hold onto the store as sole co-owners for at least three to five more years and met with an outside consultant to devise an eventual exit strategy.|$|E

500|$|Since {{leaving the}} county executive's office, {{he has worked}} in private {{business}} in Buffalo. Gorski worked for HealthNow (Parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York) for nine years {{in a variety of}} capacities. [...] At first he was hired as a consultant to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York in January 2000. [...] At the time <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> talk in local op-ed pages about the prospects of him serving as Superintendent of Buffalo Public Schools. [...] He also consulted for the Upstate Medicare Division. [...] By December 2000, he had been hired as a Vice President of HealthNow. He eventually became {{a senior vice president at}} HealthNow overseeing government affairs and lobbying, which made him responsible for government health programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Family Health Plus and Child Health Plus and earned him a 2007 salary of $398,302. Previously, Gorski was HealthNow's vice president of policy and representation. [...] In February 2009 HealthNow laid off 17 employees, including Gorski and three other senior executives, during a restructuring. [...] In July 2009, Gorski was hired by McCullagh Coffee Co. of Buffalo to help it negotiate government channels on many fronts—especially with its new [...] "sustainable" [...] coffee brands.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Army, having ample {{reserves}} {{of fuel and}} trucks, opted for all-truck logistics from the onset of their military reform of 1940. As General Robert W. Grow wrote, [...] "there {{was not a single}} horse in the American Army in Europe, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> cavalry action." [...] Nevertheless, horses, mules, donkeys and even oxen remained essential in rough, remote areas of the Pacific.|$|E
2500|$|As {{this was}} a {{somewhat}} small land area to accommodate the herd of cows and as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> [...] "feed" [...] outside this, as well as {{there were only a}} small number of houses and lots of vacant land, at times the cows were let out, without a [...] " [...] herdsman" [...] to wander along the creek banks and across the properties then returning to the home paddock prior to milking. [...] This occurred until 1939 when it ceased operating. The original house still exists and the current owners affectionately call it [...] "The Dairyman's Cottage".

2500|$|As an {{unexpected}} {{benefit of the}} double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with photoperiodism. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, [...] "As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> rain. Soon we had varieties that fit {{the whole range of}} conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books". This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Avon {{remained}} {{in touch with}} many influential friends. For example, in the lead-up to the Falklands War of 1982, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, confided during a Cabinet meeting that the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had spoken to Lady Avon {{of the risk of}} a [...] "socialist" [...] regime being established in Argentina. Lady Avon also attended various state occasions, as well as gatherings of former Prime Ministers and their families. In 1972 (while her husband was still alive) she described to Cecil Beaton the Duchess of Windsor's [...] "very strange" [...] and nervous demeanour – [...] "Is this my seat?" [...] "Is this my prayer book?" [...] "What do I do now?" [...] – at the funeral of her husband, the former King Edward VIII, while thirty years later Tony Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell noted that, at a dinner at 10 Downing Street in 2002 to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, attended by five Prime Ministers and several relatives of deceased Prime Ministers:Prince Philip was deep in conversation with T B, the Countess of Avon, Macmillan's and Douglas-Home's families, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> reminiscing about life in Number 10.|$|E

So Dick and I determined that if we came into another storming business, we would fill our pockets beforehand with money.

60|$|I want to {{tell you}} of some of my {{experiences}} in business, and then I will {{be in a position to}} lay down one general rule for the guidance of those who want to succeed in business. My first effort was about twenty-five years ago. I took hold of an invention--I don't know now what it was all about, but some one came to me tend told me it was a good thing, and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> money in it. He persuaded me to invest $15,000, and I lived up to my beliefs by engaging a man to develop it. To make a long story short, I sunk $40,000 in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Money, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> it, all stored away in {{what they}} called the {{treasure}} house, for money was no good there. Jewels and ornaments, watches, and the things which they uses in them Catholic churches, and all kinds of valuable things, and stores of silks and velvets and all kinds of materials; and as to wine and such like, there was enough to have lasted them for years, for from first to last it was shown afterward that those fellows must have captured more nor fifty vessels. Why they shouldn't have stopped ashore and enjoyed what they got was a mystery to me. But I suppose they couldn't do without excitement, and though every man talked of the time when the treasure would be divided and they were to scatter, I don't suppose as one ever expected as the time would really come.|$|E
60|$|We had {{a pretty}} dull time on that tug. There wasn't {{a great deal of}} talking, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> thinking, and not a very {{pleasant}} kind of thinking either. We stopped quite often and hailed small boats, and the captain talked to people whenever he had a chance, but he never heard anything about any boats having run ashore on any of the islands, or having come into the inside passage, between any of them. We met a few sailing vessels, and toward the close of the afternoon we met a big steamer, something like northern river steamers. The captain said she ran between the St. John's River and Savannah, and always took the inside passage as far as she could. He said this as if it showed him to be in the right in taking the same passage, but I couldn't see that it proved anything. We were on a different business.|$|E
