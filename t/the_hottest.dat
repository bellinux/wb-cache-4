5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms.

5000|$|After December 5, 1998, songs could {{chart on}} <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100 with just airplay points. However, {{before they were}} allowed onto <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100, {{they had to make}} the Top 75 on <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100 Airplay chart. Starting from the chart issue of February 12, 2005, songs without a retail {{component}} were allowed to chart on <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100 regardless of their rank on <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100 Airplay chart. Songs that charted on <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100 without a commercial single release were known as album cuts. The first airplay-only single to hit number one on <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100 came in June 2000 when Aaliyah's [...] "Try Again" [...] spent one week at the top. The method of radio-only cuts eventually stopped after the incorporation of digital downloaded music-based points into <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> 100, which made album cuts always available to download, even if not released as a single.|$|R

5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and driest periods.|$|E
5|$|Mimi pulls Carey in two {{opposite}} directions. Most of {{the tracks}} find her paired with <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> hip hop producers of the day; there, she exercises restraint and settles into a groove.

5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> song in the world.

5|$|The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more luminous.

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see Lake Manly). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh. Death Valley is one of <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and driest places in North America, yet {{it is home to}} over 1,000 species of plants; 23 of which, including the very rare Rock Lady (Holmgrenanthe petrophila), are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E

5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-8b is {{the fifth}} of the first five exoplanets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which aims to discover planets in a region of the sky between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus that transit (cross in front of) their host stars.
