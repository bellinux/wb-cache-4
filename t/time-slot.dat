5|$|Episodes {{have been}} {{broadcast}} on Thursday nights at 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), since Grey's third season. The {{first two seasons}} aired after Desperate Housewives in the Sunday 10:00 pm EST <b>time-slot.</b> All episodes are approximately forty-three minutes, excluding commercials, and are broadcast in both high-definition and standard. Episodes are also available for download at the iTunes Store in standard and high definition, and Amazon Video, with new episodes appearing the day after their live airings. ABC Video on demand also releases episodes of the show, typically one to two days after their premieres. Recent episodes are available at ABC's official Grey's Anatomy website, and on Hulu. In 2009, ABC signed a deal allowing Grey's Anatomy episodes to be streamed on Netflix.|$|E
5|$|Greys Anatomy has {{received}} high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons {{of the program}} each {{ranked in the top}} ten among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's <b>time-slot</b> being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. Grey's Anatomy made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet Grey's Anatomy still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the digital video recorder (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} the premiere {{was written by}} series creator Shonda Rhimes, while Rob Corn served as the director. The episode aired on September 27, 2007 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with an {{approximated}} 20.93 million viewers tuning in. Ranking second in the <b>time-slot</b> and third for the week, the episode garnered a 7.3 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic, seeing a decrease from the previous episode, which received an 8.0 rating. Critical response of the episode ranged from mixed to negative, with Yang's storyline being a particular source of critical acclaim from television reviewers. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, 2012, Savage's {{talk show}} left the airwaves after {{he won a}} legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his {{longtime}} employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way. Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012. By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners. On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET <b>time-slot</b> beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.|$|E

25|$|Countdown was {{originally}} broadcast weekly, at 6:30pm on Friday evenings for 25minutes. Contributing to its success was the move in January 1975 to a 6pm Sunday <b>time-slot</b> and extending to 60minutes. Its reach was improved by a mid-afternoon Saturday <b>time-slot</b> {{to repeat the}} previous week's show. Countdown soon became the most successful and popular TV music program ever made in Australia, which exerted a dramatic influence on the local music scene over the next decade. The advent of colour TV in March 1975 coincided with {{a major shift in}} the direction of local popular music and was vital in the national success for artists such as Skyhooks and Sherbet. Countdown benefited from the emergence of the music video genre: it popularised promotional videos, which were previously a minor part of pop shows. Its use of film-clips, by both established and developing overseas acts (which rarely toured Australia), made Countdown an important venue for breaking new songs and new artists.|$|E
25|$|The show {{came under}} a modest debut, with 51,000 viewers nationally {{tuning in to}} watch the show. The {{following}} Monday, the audience for Breakfast was down to 42,000. Breakfast then reduced {{to an average of}} around 40,000 viewers nationally each morning. Despite having ratings lower than other breakfast television shows, the program still beat Ten's previous line-up. Additionally, advertising revenue in the early-morning <b>time-slot</b> since Breakfast launched was more than double that of before.|$|E
25|$|After President Nixon's {{resignation}} in 1974, Rather {{took the}} assignment of chief correspondent for the documentary series CBS Reports. In December 1975, he became a correspondent of the long-running Sunday night news show 60 Minutes, just as the program was moved from a Sunday afternoon <b>time-slot</b> to primetime. Success there (and a threat to bolt to ABC News) helped Rather pull ahead of longtime correspondent Roger Mudd in line to succeed Walter Cronkite as anchor and Managing Editor of CBS Evening News.|$|E

[...]) for a time-window of, respectively, 16, 40, 80, and 235 <b>time-slots.</b> We {{see that}} our novel {{adaptive}} algorithms perform better {{than all the}} other algorithms for all the cases. It {{should also be noted that}} since the WINNER I system has many <b>time-slots</b> within the time-window of 80 ms, the two adaptive algorithms obtain a throughput guarantee that is very close to the optimal throughput guarantee of 0.5675 bits/s/Hz for this system. It is also interesting to observe that the throughput guarantee that can be promised with close to unity probability with the adaptive algorithms is more than twice as large as for the PFS algorithm for all the four systems. It should be noted that our non-adaptive optimal algorithm also performs better {{than all the other}} well-known algorithms for the case where the time-window contains 235 <b>time-slots</b> (WINNER I). The reason for this is that the non-adaptive algorithm is designed for long time-windows containing many <b>time-slots.</b>|$|R
40|$|Course {{timetabling}} {{consists in}} scheduling {{a set of}} lectures for each course over a set of <b>time-slots</b> and within a set of classrooms. This is done for a prefixed period of time (usually one week). Several sets of constraints having different nature should be respected (e. g. Schaerf for a survey). Such problems are a frequent database application. They generally {{turn out to be}} very computationally demanding. Moreover, {{in the case of the}} Faculty of Engineering of "La Sapienza" University of Rome, two very different sets of courses should be scheduled in the same classrooms: extensive courses, lasting one year with extensive-type <b>time-slots,</b> and intensive courses, lasting one semester with intensive-type <b>time-slots.</b> A global discrete model of the problem is developed. Due to its dimension, the problem is solved by decomposing it into a fist assignment of lectures to <b>time-slots,</b> and a second assignment of lecture-time-slots to classrooms. As in many real world problems, several constraints had to be relaxed in order to make the problem feasible...|$|R

25|$|Ratings, however, {{continued}} to decline (final season was #69 in the ratings) and were further {{exacerbated by the}} change in <b>time-slot</b> as the series was in competition with the strong NBC Thursday prime-time line-up. The Cosby Show, which had supplanted Dynasty as the #1 show on television in 1986, {{continued to}} hold that lead. In May 1989, new ABC entertainment president Robert A. Iger cancelled Dynasty, making the last episode of season nine, the series finale. The show ended on a cliffhanger with Blake, Fallon, Krystina, Alexis and Dex in mortal peril.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Broadchurch series one {{was seen by}} an average of 9.1 million viewers (31 percent {{audience}} share).

It won its <b>time-slot</b> beating Mayday and Embarrassing Bodies. This was the best premiere episode of a weekday new drama series in the United Kingdom since ITV's Whitechapel debuted in January 2009. Only two other dramas, Life Begins (2002) and Doc Martin (2004), debuted with higher numbers since 2002.|$|E

The first 14 episodes were taped in Auckland, and in Hamilton for a short time, before settling in at the Canterbury Court Stadium in Christchurch. The final season in 1983-84 was shot at the Auckland YMCA.
