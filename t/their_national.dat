Through consideration of the jurisprudence of both international and regional human rights treaty monitoring bodies, as well as relevant domestic court decisions, this paper will construct a framework for when a sending state’s obligations begin and end with regard to <b>their</b> <b>nationals</b> facing capital punishment charges abroad...|$|R
