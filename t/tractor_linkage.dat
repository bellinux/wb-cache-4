40|$|In {{order to}} study tillage power optimization, a tillage-force {{measuring}} {{system has been}} built with transducers in the three-point hitch mechanism, and then has been calibrated and tested in the field. The uniqueness of this system {{is its ability to}} measure the three orthogonal components of the tillage force despite using only three force sensors; this was possible by using a three-dimensional analysis of the <b>tractor</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism. A dynamic calculus program was developed to take into consideration the changes of the three-point hitch-mechanism geometry during the tillage operation. The calibration results showed a linear relation between the applied and the measured forces. The preliminary field tests proved the stability of the system results. The developed system can readily be applied in studies to minimize tillage energy consumption. © 2008 IAgrE...|$|E
40|$|Current pear pruning {{making use}} of {{pneumatic}} shears still is a very labour intensive operation. The Proder project “Avaliação da poda mecânica em pomares de pera” was designed to contribute to solutions that would reduce the present dependence in labour and therefore to promote a reduction in pruning costs. This paper shows {{the results of a}} trial made to evaluate the influence of mechanical topping in manual pruning complement field work and pear yield. Topping was performed using a Reynolds 6 DT 3. 0 m cutting bar with six hydraulic-driven circular disc-saws mounted in the three point <b>tractor</b> <b>linkage</b> system. The field trial was performed in a commercial orchard with 20 years, planted in an array of 4 m x 2 m with tree lines oriented in North-South direction. Trees were trained as the central leader system. In this trial, in a randomised complete block design with four replications, two treatments are being compared leading to 8 plots with one line of 14 trees per plot. The treatments tests were: T 1 - manual pruning performed by workers using pneumatic shears, in each year; T 2 - Topping the canopy parallel to the ground, using a discs-saw pruning machine mounted in a front loader of an agricultural tractor, followed by manual pruning complement performed by workers with pneumatic shears. Tree height and width was measured, before and after pruning. Work was timed and pear yields evaluated. Mechanical topping seems to be effective in the control of tree height, which can contribute to increase 14 % of work rates on manual pruning complement. No significant differences in pear yield were found between treatments...|$|E

50|$|Haylage {{refers to}} high dry matter silage of around 45% to 75%. Horse haylage is usually 55% to 75% dry matter, made in small bales or larger bales.Handling of wrapped bales {{is most often}} with some type of gripper that squeezes the plastic-covered bale between two metal parts to avoid {{puncturing}} the plastic. Simple fixed versions are available for round bales which are made of two shaped pipes or tubes spaced apart to slide under {{the sides of the}} bale, but when lifted will not let it slip through. Often used on the <b>tractor</b> rear three-point <b>linkage,</b> they incorporate a trip tipping mechanism which can flip the bales over on to the flat side/end for storage on the thickest plastic layers.|$|R
40|$|A {{swinging}} arm {{type of frame}} height sensor was designed to measure the distance variation between the soil surface and the frame of a sensor system developed for the online measurement (tractor-based continuous measurement) of the spatial variation in soil compaction. A linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) with a 0. 2 m stroke length was used to connect the frame to a metal wheel of the frame height sensor at the axle of the wheel. An analytical-statistical hybrid model was developed for the direct calculation of the frame height variation. Tests were performed on four surfaces: asphalt road; rough dirt track; and agricultural silty clay loam soil (bare soil and soil with stubble present). The results were compared with ultrasonic measurements to validate the sensor. An excellent correspondence of distance measurement {{was found between the}} two sensors with a standard error (SE) of 0. 0033 m and with a high determination coefficient R- 2 of 0. 93. However, the measurement of the frame height was found to be exaggerated when using the wheel-LVDT sensor on the dirt track, which was attributed to the wheel sinkage in the loose soil. Although the standard error between the wheel-LVDT measurements and ultrasonic distance measurements was still low (0. 0049 m) for the dirt track, this was higher than that found on the asphalt road. Similarly, the trajectories of the frame height measurement performed on the field showed a good correspondence between the wheel-LVDT sensor and the ultrasonic sensor. The wheel-LVDT sensor measured a slightly larger height than the ultrasonic sensor, with mean deviations ranging between 0. 018 and 0. 021 m. In comparison with the standard error (0. 035 m) of the measurement line with maize stubble, lower standard errors of 0. 0064 and 0. 0088 m with high R- 2 were found for the bare soil surface without and with subsoiler, respectively. Pressing of the stubble by the relatively large mass of the wheel of 175 N made the measurement of frame height variation with the wheel-LVDT sensor apparently less affected by stubble compared to the measurement with the ultrasonic sensor. Therefore, the wheel-LVDT sensor can be used more accurately than the ultrasonic sensor, in fields covered with plant residues and stubble, providing the input for the position control of the <b>tractor</b> three-point <b>linkage</b> aiming at online measurement of soil compaction at constant depths. Based on a certain soil type, moisture content and dry bulk density, correction factors need to be selected and subtracted from the wheel-LVDT sensor output to compensate for the extra distance measured due to the wheel sinkage on a bare soil surface.

40|$|Interest in {{front-mounted}} implements {{has increased}} {{during the last}} couple of years. One drawback of the commercially available front linkages is, however, that they have been unable to move sideways. Jönsson (1983) formulated the conditions that must be fulfilled to build a front-mounted three-point hitch that allows lateral movements of the implement since it centres the implement. This is done in two different ways, depending on the implement. Directional implements are centred if the lower links of the hitch converges in the direction of travel. This was first shown by Makanjuola & Cowell (1970). The return velocity of the implement depends on the convergence of the lower links. Non-directional implements are more difficult to centre. While directional implements centre due to the linkage geometry, non-directional implements centre due to the internal forces in the linkage. Jönsson (1983) formulated a criterion of stability: (FT/FR) > (LC/LA) where FT= Force in upper link. FR= The implement's resulting force on the linkage. LC= Lateral distance between the linkage’s instantaneous centre and the centre of resistance. LA= Distance between the instantaneous centre and the upper link forces. If the stability criterion is true in every possible position that the three-point linkage can reach, a non-directional implement will centre after a. disturbance. In this work, a front-mounted self-centring three-point hitch of that kind was built and tested. The hitch was tested in combination with five different implements: 1. A one-furrow fully-mounted plough. During the work the plough proved to be self-centering and steerable. The plough was, however, very sensitive to the linkage adjustments. This was primarily due to the short upper link and mast height. On the other hand, the short top link functioned as a depth control. As the working depth of the plough changed, the change of the share pitch brought the tool back to its original depth. 2. Hoe. With this implement this front-coupling was superior to the conventional rear-mounted type. According to the driver's wish, the linkage was easily adjusted to slow or fast reaction. A slowly reacting implement compensates better for bad driving in rowcrops than a fast reacting one. On the other hand, the turning radius increases. It is also better from the ergonomic point of view to have this kind of implement in front of the driver. 3. Harrow. During the tests the harrow usually, but not always, centred itself. In extreme conditions the harrow's clod-crusher nullified the centring ability. A harrow with a jointed cross-shaft ought to be self-centering. The joint will permit vertical movement of the implement. Thereby the clod-crusher cannot interfere with the upper link-forces. 4. Single tine. The front coupling was also tested with a single tine. This was done to test a pure non-directional implement. With the tine the centring was good and the front-mounted three-point hitch behaved as expected. 5. Single disc. In order to test a pure directional implement, a single disc was mounted to the hitch. During the tests the return velocity of the implement was measured at different cross-shaft lengths. A dependence between the length of the cross-shaft (the convergence) and the return velocity was indicated, in spite of severe disturbances during the tests. The tested type of front-linkage probably has a greater developing potential than the ones available on the market today. The self-centring front-linkage reduces the stress on the <b>tractor,</b> the <b>linkage</b> and the implement more than the conventional front-linkages. The driver ergonomy is improved by using front-mounted implements instead of rear mounted. A lot of work is however needed, before this type of linkage can be commercially available. The adjustment of the coupling needs to be simplified. Some kind of regulating device for working depth is also needed to fully use the advantages of front-mounting...|$|R
40|$|Tractors {{of today}} come {{equipped}} with a CAN-system. A CAN-system sends information from sensors to electronic control units who process the signals. The sensors measure several interesting parameters such as force, pressure and speed for various components of the tractor. This thesis discuss a force sensor which {{is placed in the}} pivot of the <b>tractors</b> three point <b>linkage,</b> the sensor measure the horizontal reaction force from the load that the tractor is exposed to. Signals from this sensor can be used to measure the force from any implement that the tractor is exposed to during an operation. The results from this thesis can be used for research purposes, for example, to compare implements from different manufacturer or to optimize the implement settings during an operation. However, there is a problem that this thesis aimed to solve by developing a method which can be put into practice. When a constant force from an implement is acting on the three point linkage, the reaction force in the pivot of the three point linkage (where the force sensor is attached) is going to vary depending on the angel of the lower lift arm. It is not uncommon that the angel of the lower lift arm is varying, because different implement and soil require different settings on the linkage. This means that the force which is measured by the sensor may vary in size even though the actual force does not vary. To solve this problem, theoretical calculations have been performed and equations to describe the variation of the reaction force depending on the geometry have been created. The theory has also been verified by a finite element analysis and a practical verification test. The conclusions from these three parts correspond to each other. Theoretically that means by knowing the horizontal reaction force (measured by the force sensor) and the angles of the geometry on the three point linkage (can be measured with a position sensor) you can calculate the force an implement influence the tractor with. However, there is a problem which prevents this method from being completely reliable. It is only working when the impact force is completely parallel to the horizontal plane. Since many implements are being pulled to the soil (plow, cultivator, etc.) in practice there are also vertical forces affecting the tractor. This is no problem to solve in theory, but in practice this method does not compensate for the vertical force. This vertical force should be examined more carefully before the method can be used reliably in full scale...|$|R
