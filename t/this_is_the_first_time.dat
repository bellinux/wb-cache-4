5|$|The idea to {{have the}} episode in flashbacks was {{originally}} thought up in the color screening stage of production. This is the first episode directed by Rich Moore. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> Jebediah Springfield is mentioned, {{as well as the}} first time the Simpsons go to church. The announcer of the football game Homer is listening to at church is based on Keith Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In the 75th Elder election, {{there are}} four finalists; Hatsune Minase hands over her votes to Kaoruko and Makiyo Shingyouji hands over her votes to Chihaya. Then Chihaya and Kaoruko gain the same votes of 368 together. Though a {{candidate}} which gains 75% {{or more of the}} votes becomes the Elder, Hatsune, as the student council president, proposes that both Chihaya and Kaoruko become the Elders; the motion is adopted unanimously. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> there have been two Elders in the history of Seio Girls' Academy.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, 2013, propene was {{detected}} in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft's first close flyby of Titan in 1980, during which {{it was discovered that}} many of the gases that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet photolysis of methane.|$|E

5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Mugabe {{received}} an honorary knighthood from the British state; this was stripped from {{him at the}} advice of the UK government in 2008. Mugabe holds several honorary degrees and doctorates from international universities, awarded to him in the 1980s; at least three of these have since been revoked. In June 2007, he became the first international figure ever to be stripped of an honorary degree by a British university, when the University of Edinburgh withdrew the degree awarded to him in 1984. On 12 June 2008, the University of Massachusetts Amherst Board of Trustees voted to revoke the law degree awarded to Mugabe in 1986; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> one of its honorary degrees has been revoked.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of its Whopper Bar {{locations}} in the United States during 2010, Burger King reported {{that it would be}} the first time in its North American locations that beer would be available for purchase. Although beer is available at fast food restaurants throughout Europe, including Burger King, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> a major fast food chain has attempted to sell beer in the United States. The company will be selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch including Budweiser, Bud Lite and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because of the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is a practical one because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} Michigan's first shutout of a Big Ten {{opponent}} since a 20–0 win at Penn State on October 6, 2001, and its first shutout of any opponent since a 38–0 win against Notre Dame on September 15, 2007. The 58–0 {{win over the}} Golden Gophers was Michigan's largest margin of victory over Minnesota in the series' history. The previous best was 51 (58–7) in 1993. The game also marked Michigan's largest margin of victory over any opponent since a 69–0 victory over Northwestern in October 1975. (Michigan also defeated Indiana by an identical 58–0 score in October 2000.) Vincent Smith became the first running back in FBS to pass for a touchdown and have touchdowns rushing and receiving since C. J. Spiller on November 14, 2009, against North Carolina State. He is the fifth Big Ten player to do so since 1996 and the first since Mike Kafka, who accomplished the feat for Northwestern on September 19, 2009. Michigan outgained Minnesota 580 to 177. Minnesota's total yardage was the lowest allowed by Michigan since the game against Minnesota in 2008. Michigan rushed for 363 yards of offense, its third straight game of rushing for more than 300 yards. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> this has occurred since the 1987 season.|$|E
