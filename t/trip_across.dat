5|$|Hammonds did {{not play}} professionally in 1992 as he competed for the United States {{national}} baseball team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He faced a two-month road <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> sixteen states by bus, more travel combined with training than employed by any professional team. Hammonds struggled with the national team initially, but agreed to sign with the Orioles in July 1992, receiving a $975,000 signing bonus, the largest of any player chosen in that draft. Upon signing, his hitting improved.|$|E
5|$|In July 1897, {{the first}} {{news of the}} Klondike gold strike reached Seattle, Washington, {{triggering}} the Klondike Gold Rush. Thousands of people boarded steamships heading north to the gold fields.

5|$|The {{national}} {{associations of}} selected nations {{were invited to}} send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until {{two months before the}} start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.|$|E

5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by Croatian writer Darko Macan, {{the series}} was then taken over by Brian Azzarello, once again hired {{on the strength of}} his own series for Vertigo, 100 Bullets. Azzarello's run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> America, starting with his incarceration in prison, then variously uncovering a pornography ring, catching a serial killer, taking on a Neo Nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor, a thinly-veiled pastiche of Batman. Brian Azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue #250.|$|E
5|$|GeoJourney was {{a special}} {{academic}} program conducted by the School of Earth, Environment, and Society that featured a nine-week field trip/camping trip/road <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> the United States to national parks and monuments granting 24 students a semester of college credit. The GeoJourney field program included Geology, Environmental Studies and Native American studies. Credits applied to the BG Perspective general education requirements.

The program was pulled from the University in 2013 by its creators Nichole and Ian Rodgers.|$|E

5|$|Hasekura {{stayed for}} 5 months in Mexico {{on his way}} back to Japan. The San Juan Bautista was waiting in Acapulco since 1616, after a second <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shōgen, she was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. Following a request by the Spanish king, in order to avoid too much silver leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the {{proceeds}} to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver which Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively.|$|E

The 9th Division boarded the ships during late January 1943, and the convoy operation began on 4 February. No contact was made between Allied and Japanese ships, and the 9th Division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a report}} of the trip Armstrong later filed with the Hawaiian government, any {{negotiations}} for Indian contract labor had to be done with the British government in London, so no talks were conducted during their time in India. They arrived in Calcutta on May 28 and visited the Alipore Zoological Gardens. Kalākaua spent one day sitting in the Calcutta courthouse to observe India's legal process. Their <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> the British India subcontinent was a sightseeing excursion during their last days before sailing to the Middle East, and they stopped to tour the Ellora Caves prior to reaching Bombay. The King soon tired of the long journey, and was bored and restless by the time they arrived at Bombay, where they remained until the departure of their steamship on June 7. There was more in Bombay to interest him: a shopping trip, the Arab Stallion Stables, the Parsi Towers of Silence, and a visit from businessman Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.|$|E

5|$|After {{about half}} of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat USS Elk and an armed private ship, the Grey Eagle, arrived on the scene. The Elk fired a shot into {{the deck of the}} Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both of the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate {{artillery}} opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies across the river. By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried across the river. On the last <b>trip</b> <b>across,</b> most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road <b>trip</b> <b>across</b> the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E
