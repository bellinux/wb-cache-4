5000|$|Threads can be (and often are) {{truncated}} a bit more, yielding thread {{depths of}} 60 percent to 75 {{percent of the}} [...]65p value. For example, a 75 percent thread sacrifices {{only a small amount}} of strength in exchange for a significant reduction in the force required to cut the thread. The result is that <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> wear is reduced, the likelihood of breakage is lessened and higher cutting speeds can often be employed.|$|E
50|$|Metalworking <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> {{were often}} made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1795 the South Hadley Canal opened, {{enabling}} {{boats to}} bypass the South Hadley falls and reach Greenfield via the Connecticut River. Located at {{the confluence of the}} Deerfield and Green rivers, and not far from where they merge into the Connecticut River, Greenfield developed into a trade center. Falls provided water power for industry, and Greenfield grew into a prosperous mill town. John Russell established the Green River Works in 1834, hiring skilled German workers at what was the country's first cutlery factory. The Connecticut River Railroad was the first of several railways to enter the town, replacing the former canal trade. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Greenfield {{was one of the most}} important American centers of the <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> business and was the home of Greenfield Tap & Die Company (GTD).|$|E
5000|$|Both tools {{can be used}} {{to clean}} up a thread, which is called chasing. However, using an {{ordinary}} tap or die to clean threads will generally result in the removal of some material, which will result in looser and weaker threads. Because of this, threads are typically cleaned using special <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> made for this purpose, which are known as [...] "chasers". Chasers are made of softer materials and are not capable of cutting new threads, however they are still tighter fitting than actual fasteners and are fluted like regular <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> (to provide a means for debris like dirt and rust to escape). One particularly common use is for automotive spark plug threads, which often suffer from corrosion and a buildup of carbon.|$|R

50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} <b>tap</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> <b>and</b> urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws.|$|R
50|$|<b>Taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are tools used {{to create}} screw threads, which is called threading. Many are cutting tools; others are forming tools. A tap is used to cut or form the female portion of the mating pair (e.g., a nut). A die is used to cut or form the male portion of the mating pair (e.g., a bolt). The process of cutting or forming threads using a tap is called tapping, whereas the process using a die is called threading.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The single-point cutting tools or <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R
50|$|Before this, {{screw threads}} were usually made by {{chipping}} and filing (that is, with skilled freehand use of chisels and files). Nuts were rare; metal screws, when made at all, were usually {{for use in}} wood. Metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening {{on the other side}} were usually fastened in non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer). Maudslay standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.</b> Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole is threaded.|$|R
50|$|Maudslay {{designed}} a tool holder {{into which the}} cutting tool would be clamped, and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction. The slide rest was positioned by a leadscrew to which power was transmitted through a pair of changeable gears so that it traveled {{in proportion to the}} turning of the work. This allowed screw threads to be precisely cut. Changing the gears gave various pitches. The ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components. He standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.|$|R
50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it.

The tools include many examples of such things as planes, table knives, anvils, files, <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, handsaws, and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|R
2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} milling cutter if the correct helical toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|R
40|$|The term “cutting tool” in fact {{covers a}} very large variety of tools: turning tools, drill bits, planer tools and {{slotting}} tools, scraping or shaving tools, drill spindles, milling cutters, facing cutters, recessing tools, reamers, <b>taps</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> files, <b>and</b> grinding wheels. HSS cutting tool was commonly used for turning process for manufacturing. At common market there is many large selection of HSS tool steel with different type and mark. One of them was HSS tool steel made in Germany and Taiwan which share the same trade mark but have significant differences at price. At this paper our testing focused on comparation between HSS tool steel made in German and the one made in Taiwan which we can commonly found at the market. Our testing consist of hardness test, micrography test and chemical composition test. By that test we want to obtain which HSS more reliable for manufacturing process.

40|$|The lack of {{standardization}} in assembly {{techniques for}} DNA sequences forces each DNA assembly reaction {{to be both}} an experimental tool for addressing the current research topic, and an experiment in and of itself. One of our goals is to replace this ad hoc experimental design {{with a set of}} standard and reliable engineering mechanisms to remove much of the tedium and surprise during assembly of genetic components into larger systems. William Sellers, in a speech On a Uniform System of of Screw Threads at the Franklin Institute in Philadephia on April 21, 1864, remarked that “In this country, no organized attempt has as yet been made to establish any system, each manufacturer having adopted whatever his judgement may have dictated as best, or as most convenient for himself ” (Surowiecki 02). He argued forcefully and successfully for the standardization of pitch, diameter, and form of screw threads, providing the infrastructure which allowed the industrial revolution to take off. The machinists of the Franklin Institute built the lathes, drills, <b>taps,</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> necessary to make the standard a success. Figure 1 : A US Standard Screw Thread We anticipate advantages similar to those which accompany the standardization of screw threads in mechanical design – the widespread ability to interchange parts, to assemble sub-components, to outsource assembly to others, and to rely extensively on previously manufactured components. Here, we present a simple sequence and assembly standard as part of an experiment to see how far this idea of standardized interface technology can be applied. The key notion in the design of our strategy is that the transformations performed on component parts during the assembly reactions are idempotent in a structural sense. That is, each reaction leaves the key structural elements of the component the same. The output of any such transformation, therefore, is a component which can be used as the input to any subsequent manipulation. It need never be constructed again – it can be added to the permanent library of previously assembled components, and used as a compound structure in more complex assemblies...|$|R
