5|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted. As Lacrosse's crew made desperate efforts to turn southwards, the ship's {{foremast}} and bowsprit collapsed {{under the pressure of}} the wind. With the ship virtually unmanageable, Lacrosse ordered the anchors lowered in an attempt to hold the ship in position until repairs could be made. This effort was futile, as all but two anchors had been lost during efforts to hold position in Bantry Bay, and British gunfire had damaged one of the anchor cables and rendered it useless. The final anchor was deployed, but it failed to restrain the ship and at 07:00 (according to the French account), the Droits de l'Homme struck a sandbank close to the town of Plozévet. This broke off the remaining mast and caused the ship <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> onto her side.|$|E
5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over.</b> The deck {{became so}} steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, January 6, 1913, Cheslakee {{departed}} Union dock in Vancouver at 8:45 pm {{bound for}} Van Anda, on Texada Island. [...] The ship, {{under the command}} of Capt.

50|$|Among other trips, in 1908, Yosemite carried {{almost the}} entire student body of the University of Washington out into Puget Sound to greet the Great White Fleet. In this {{particular}} trip, the vessel was obviously grossly overloaded, as {{the weight of the}} passengers caused her <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> so sharply <b>over</b> <b>to</b> port that the water came up {{to the bottom of the}} port side paddle wheel guard.|$|R
2500|$|Mostyn took {{command of}} the 70-gun [...] in April 1744 and was {{assigned}} to Sir John Balchen's fleet. By early 1745 Mostyn was cruising off Ushant with three other ships, , [...] and [...] On 6 January they fell in with three French ships; Neptune, Fleuron and Mars, and chased them. Neptune and Fleuron were 74-gun ships, while Mars was a smaller vessel, a former English privateer. Mars {{broke away from the}} other two French ships, and was pursued by Captain, which captured the French ship that evening. Sunderland lost her fore-topmast and fell behind, leaving Hampton Court and Dreadnought to pursue the remaining two French ships alone. Mostyn soon closed on the French, but Dreadnought still lagged behind. After waiting another day and night in the hope that Dreadnought would catch up, Mostyn abandoned the chase, fearing that he was too close to the French shore, and that he would be overwhelmed by the combined firepower of his opponents if he attacked alone. After his return to port, Mostyn justified his actions, claiming that the choppy, squally weather caused his ship <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> so far as to render his lower gunports inoperable, while the French vessels sat higher in the water and could have used theirs. Without Dreadnought to support him, Mostyn argued that he could have been overwhelmed, had he risked an attack.|$|E

60|$|Over my head I {{could hear}} Mr. Mellaire {{steadily}} pace up and down. At four the watches changed, and I recognized the age-lag in Mr. Pike's promenade. Half an hour later, {{just as the}} steward's alarm went off, instantly checked by that light-sleeping Asiatic, the Elsinore began <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> on my side. I could hear Mr. Pike barking and snarling orders, and at times a trample and shuffle of many feet passed over my head as the weird crew pulled and hauled. The Elsinore continued <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> until I could see the water against my port, and then she gathered way and dashed ahead at such a rate that I could hear the stinging and singing of the foam through the circle of thick glass beside me.|$|E
50|$|Vasa sank {{because it}} had very little initial stability, which {{can be thought of}} as {{resistance}} <b>to</b> <b>heeling</b> <b>over</b> under the force of wind or waves acting on the hull. The reason for this is that the distribution of mass in the hull structure and the ballast, guns, provisions, and other objects loaded on board puts too much weight too high in the ship. The centre of gravity is too high, and so it takes very little force to make the ship <b>heel</b> <b>over,</b> and there is not enough righting moment, force trying to make the ship return to an upright position. The reason that the ship has such a high centre of gravity is not due to the guns. These weighed little over 60 tonnes, or about 5% of the total displacement of the loaded ship. This is relatively low weight and should be bearable in a ship this size. The problem is in the hull construction itself. The part of the hull above the waterline is too high and too heavily built in relation to the amount of hull in the water. The headroom in the decks is higher than necessary for crewmen who were, on average, only 1.67 metres (5 feet 5½ inches) tall, and thus the weight of the decks and the guns they carry is higher above the waterline than needed. In addition, the deck beams and their supporting timbers are over-dimensioned and too closely spaced for the loads they carry, so they contribute too much weight to the already tall and heavy upper works.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a famous}} prima donna with whom it was my good fortune to cross the Atlantic to New York. In truth I was charged by a friend of both with the {{agreeable}} duty of caring for her safety and comfort. Madame was gracious, clever, altogether charming, and before the voyage was two days old a half-dozen of the men aboard, whom she had permitted me <b>to</b> present, were <b>heels</b> <b>over</b> head in love with her, as I was myself.|$|R
2500|$|The {{evening was}} calm and {{somewhat}} clear, {{and as the}} vessel steamed west past Alki Point into the open Sound, Captain Lermond went to his quarters behind the pilot house to tally the fares. Off Duwamish Head, Dix approached near the Alaska Coast Company steamer Jeanie and then mate Dennison (who it turns out was unlicensed) inexplicably turned the vessel directly into Jeanie‘s path. Jeanie was ten {{times the size of}} Dix and loaded with iron ore. Even though Jeanie had already reversed her engines, and was barely under steerage way, the impact was sufficient, given the much greater weight of the Jeanie, to cause Dix <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> sharply <b>over</b> on her port side. She quickly filled with water, rolled over, and sank in [...] Captain Lermond described the terrifying scene: ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the boat touched the landing-place and swung round, so that its bow, where Tua was, struck {{the head of the}} crocodile, which seemed to infuriate the beast. At least, it hurled itself upon the boat, causing the fore part <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over,</b> fill with water, and begin to sink. Then the little lad, Rames, showed the courage that was in him. Shouting to Tua: ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile {{the officer}} {{in command of}} the boat, who was armed with a musket, was {{shouting}} to them to pull down their sail and surrender; indeed, not until they were within fifty yards of him did he seem to understand their desperate purpose. Then some one in the boat called out: [...] "The devils are going to sink us," [...] and there was a rush to bow and stern to get up the anchors. Only the officer stood firm, screaming at them like a madman. It was too late; a strong gust of wind caught the Swallow, causing her <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> and sweep down on the boat like a swooping falcon.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{began to}} bail furiously with my hands, and as I bailed, {{the edge of}} the cask lifted itself above the water. When it had risen some two inches, the shark, enraged at my escape, came to the surface, and turning on its side, bit at the tub so that I heard its teeth grate on the wood and iron bands, causing it <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> and to spin round, {{shipping}} more water as it heeled. Now I must bail afresh, and had the fish renewed its onset, I should have been lost. But not finding wood and iron to its taste, it went away for a while, although I saw its fin from time to time for the space of some hours. I bailed with my hands till I could lift the water no longer, then making shift to take off my boot, I bailed with that. Soon {{the edge of the}} cask stood twelve inches above the water, and I did not lighten it further, fearing lest it should overturn. Now I had time to rest and to remember that all this was of no avail, since I must die at last either by the sea or because of thirst, and I lamented that my cowardice had only sufficed to prolong my sufferings.|$|E
60|$|But the Spaniards {{were in no}} {{condition}} to benefit by the cessation of the attack. In spite of the terrible disadvantages under which they laboured, they had fought with splendid courage. The sides of the galleons had been riddled with shot, and the splinters caused by the rending of the massive timbers had done even greater execution than the iron hail. Being always <b>to</b> leeward, and <b>heeling</b> <b>over</b> with the wind, the ships had been struck again and again below the waterline, and many were only kept from sinking by nailing sheets of lead over the shot holes.|$|R
60|$|Poppy was dreadfully sick all night, {{but next}} day was ready for more adventures and experiments. She swung on the garret stairs, and tumbled down, nearly {{breaking}} her neck. She rubbed her eyes with red peppers, {{to see if it}} really would make them smart, as Cy said; and was led home quite blind and roaring with pain. She got into the pigsty to catch a young piggy, and was taken out in a sad state of dirt. She slipped into the brook, and was half drowned; broke a window and her own head, swinging a little flat-iron on a string; dropped baby in the coal-hod; buried her doll, and spoilt her; cut off a bit of her finger, chopping wood; and broke a tooth, trying <b>to</b> turn <b>heels</b> <b>over</b> head on a haycock. These are only a few of her pranks, but one was nearly her last.|$|R
60|$|The keen eye of {{the little}} {{commander}} had seen the surface ripple, which told of a passing breeze. He had used it to dart across the big Frenchman and to rake her with every gun as he passed. But, once past her, the Leda {{had to come back}} into the wind to keep out of shoal water. The manoeuvre brought her on to the starboard side of the Frenchman, and the trim little frigate seemed <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> right <b>over</b> under the crashing broadside which burst from the gaping ports. A moment later her topmen were swarming aloft to set her top-sails and royals, and she strove to cross the Gloire's bows and rake her again. The French captain, however, brought his frigate's head round, and the two rode side by side within easy pistol-shot, pouring broadsides into each other in one of those murderous duels which, could they all be recorded, would mottle our charts with blood.|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} driven by two 2 ft wide tracks and on the surface {{steering}} was possible by means of dog clutches on the gear-box output shafts. When digging, only small changes in direction were possible by means of hydraulically operated steering doors, {{one on each side}} of the machine. There was an arrangement to draw an adjustable amount of spoil back into the trench and under the vehicle's tracks so as to counter any tendency <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{were too}} flaws in Cambridges design, which became {{apparent}} after launch. First, {{the weight of}} the additional half deck so increased her draught that her lower gun ports were at the waterline and opening them risked shipping a large quantity of seawater into the hull. Shifting the lower deck guns to the middle and upper decks accentuated the second flaw, which was a high centre of gravity that made Cambridge top-heavy and likely <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> in strong winds.|$|E
5000|$|Brett's {{orders were}} to join Admiral Edward Boscawen's Western Squadron {{protecting}} British interests on the North America and West Indies Station. Having finally put to sea {{he found that}} his ship was slow and top-heavy, with a tendency <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> in strong winds. He was also forced to deal with widespread sickness among his crew. Disease spread so fast among the crew that Cambridge was forced to return to Plymouth after only one year at sea so that the sick could be discharged to local hospitals. On 5 November 1758 Brett was granted a new position as flag captain for Admiral Anson aboard the 100-gun [...] He resigned this commission ten days later {{and returned to his}} previous role as captain of the Royal yachts.|$|E
60|$|As we {{have already}} remarked, Corrie and his two companions in misfortune had been bound; and, in this condition, were left by the savages to their fate. Their {{respective}} positions {{were by no means}} enviable. Poor Alice lay {{near the edge of the}} cliff, with her wrists and ankles so securely tied that no effort of which she was capable could set her free. Poopy lay about ten yards farther up the cliff, flat on her sable back, with her hands tied behind her, and her ankles also secured; so that she could by no means attain to a sitting position, although she made violent and extraordinary efforts to do so. We say extraordinary, because Poopy, being ingenious, hit upon many devices of an unheard of nature to accomplish her object. Among others, she attempted <b>to</b> turn <b>heels</b> <b>over</b> head, hoping thus to get upon her knees; and there is no doubt whatever that she would have succeeded in this, had not the formation of the ground been exceedingly unfavourable for such a manoeuvre.|$|R
50|$|The tide {{continued}} to ebb, causing Fenella <b>to</b> slip and <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> port, exposing the damage incurred. Captain Mylchreest and his officers inspected {{the damage and}} found that a gash had been inflicted on her starboard side that was 10 inches (25.4 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide. The ship's carpenter managed to wedge and plaster the damage with clay so as it was rendered watertight. Two other holes were subsequently discovered on the port side, one seven inches (17.8 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide and the other 15 inches (38.1 cm) long and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide, {{which led to the}} engine room and aft hold respectively. Fenella′s master engaged the services of a pilot in order to assist with the situation and at 19:00 hours Satanella arrived at the scene.|$|R
60|$|The {{excellence}} of the manoeuvring of the English ships, and the rapidity {{and accuracy of}} their fire, astonished the Spaniards. Throughout the whole forenoon the action continued; the Spaniards making efforts to close, but in vain, the English ships keeping the weather gage and sailing continually backwards and forwards, pouring in their broadsides. The height {{and size of the}} Spanish ships were against them; and being <b>to</b> leeward they <b>heeled</b> <b>over</b> directly they came up to the wind to fire a broadside, and their shots for the most part went far over their assailants, while they themselves suffered severely from the English fire. Miquel de Oquendo, who commanded one of the six Spanish squadrons, distinguished himself by his attempts to close with the English, and by maintaining his position {{in the rear of the}} fleet engaged in constant conflict with them.|$|R
50|$|Droits de l'Homme {{had been}} more seriously damaged than the British frigates, and was closer to shore at the time land was spotted.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was completed in}} May 1912 and taken by boat to Dale in Pembrokeshire for testing. The first trial showed the aircraft to accelerate well under {{the power of the}} water propellers, but after a short run the streamlined fairing of the hydropeds was torn away, ending the tests. Subsequent static tests revealed a vibration problem in the drive assembly, and while this was being examined trials were made by towing the aircraft behind a torpedo boat. Problems with stability were partially cured by minor changes to the parafoil lifting planes and the addition of a controllable water elevator and rudder to the aft hydroped, resulting in satisfactory towing characteristics, but when the water propellers were used the torque reaction caused the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over.</b> In September it was decided to conduct flight trial by towing the aircraft, and the engine was removed and replaced by 500 lbs kg of ballast. On 21 September, towed by a torpedo boat, carrying George Dacre to monitor the instruments: the machine's controls were set for level flight and locked. It lifted off at an airspeed of 30 knots (35 mph, 56 km/h) in a nose-high attitude, stalled, sideslipped and crashed, happily without injuring Dacre.|$|E
50|$|The ship's {{captain was}} {{dismissed}} {{and replaced with}} Captain Moore. The following season's journey to China was relatively uneventful, only involving {{the loss of the}} mizzen topgallant mast in a collision. Moore was moved to command Cutty Sark and replaced with Sam Bissett, who had been mate on the maiden voyage. Carrying coal from Sydney to Shanghai she was caught in a typhoon, which caused the ship <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> <b>over</b> so much that the main and mizzen masts had to be cut away once more to right her. The cargo had shifted and had to be moved before the ship could be properly righted, but she limped on to Shanghai where new masts were fitted and she proceeded to Iloio and loaded a cargo for Boston. In the China sea the ship hit an uncharted reef and stuck fast, despite throwing the cargo overboard. the ship was abandoned and the crew taken off by Albyn's isle, which had come to their assistance. A squall sprang up, which now blew the ship clear of the reef and after a chase of some hours the crew managed to reboard the ship and take control of their vessel again. A slow journey to Boston followed. For the fourth season she was commanded by Captain White.|$|E
500|$|The air {{commander}} aboard Ark Royal—aware {{that the}} surviving Dorniers would report {{the location of}} the British ships—ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti-aircraft weapons readied. Four Junkers Ju 88 bombers of the Luftwaffe bomber wing KG 30 soon appeared: three were driven away by anti-aircraft fire, but the fourth launched a [...] bomb at the carrier. Ark Royal turned hard <b>to</b> starboard, <b>heeling</b> <b>over</b> and avoiding the bomb, which landed in the ocean [...] off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over the ship. The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit, and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships, but not Ark Royal. Based on this information, the Germans incorrectly claimed that Ark Royal had sunk. To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain's allies, Winston Churchill personally reassured United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attaché to view Ark Royal in dock. The British naval attaché in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in service. This was an embarrassment for Goebbels and Nazi propaganda.|$|R

60|$|This {{apparently}} magical feat {{is accomplished}} {{by means of a}} halter of horsehair, which is passed round under the neck of the horse, and both ends braided into the mane, on the withers, thus forming a loop which hangs under the neck and against the breast. This being caught by the hand, makes a sling, into which the elbow falls, taking the weight of the body on the middle of the upper arm.

50|$|Dockyards {{were often}} {{built around a}} number of docks and slips. Traditionally, slipways were used for shipbuilding, and dry docks (also called graving docks) for maintenance; (dry docks were also {{sometimes}} used for building, particularly pre-1760 and post-1880). Regular hull maintenance was important: {{in the age of}} sail, a ship's wooden hull would be comprehensively inspected every 2-3 years, and its copper sheeting replaced every 5. Dry docks were invariably the most expensive component of any dockyard (until the advent of marine nuclear facilities). Where there was no nearby dock available (as was often the case at the overseas yards) ships would sometimes be careened (beached at high tide) to enable necessary work to be done. In the age of sail, wharves and capstan-houses were often built for the purpose of careening at yards with no dock: a system of pulleys and ropes, attached to the masthead, would be used <b>to</b> <b>heel</b> the ship <b>over</b> giving access to the hull.|$|R
