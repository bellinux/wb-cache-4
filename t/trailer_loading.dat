50|$|All <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> and {{unloading}} is {{done through}} the end frame of the trailer, which takes the most abuse.The top horizontal member is called a header. The bottom {{is referred to as}} the sill. The end frame is the action part of the trailer.

50|$|Automatic {{loading of}} {{trailers}} {{is a relatively}} new application for automated guided vehicles and becoming increasingly popular. AGVs are used to transport and load pallets of finished goods directly into standard, over-the-road trailers without any special dock equipment. AGVs can pick up pallets from conveyors, racking, or staging lanes and deliver them into the trailer in the specified loading pattern. Some Automatic <b>Trailer</b> <b>Loading</b> AGVs utilize Natural Targeting to view the walls of the trailer for navigation. These types of ATL AGVs can be either completely driverless or hybrid vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The drawbar {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the fifth wheel coupling. The drawbar requires a trailer which either loads the drawbar lightly (for example a small boat trailer, or caravan, where a load of up to ~50 kg is part of correct <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> practice), or the load is the weight of the coupling components only (larger trailers, usually but not always with a steerable hauled axle, front or rear). By contrast, the fifth wheel is designed to transmit a major proportion of the load's weight to the hauling vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{effective}} method for <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> horses based on the principles of positive reinforcement. Target training and shaping were used to teach <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> behavior in a natural setting. Five AQHA mares were selected for this program. All five had been loaded before through the use of punishment. A two-horse trailer was used. Approximations to loading and inappropriate behaviors were the dependent variables. When intervention started the target was moved to various locations inside the trailer. Subjects started training on the left side of the trailer. After a subject was loading in the left side they were moved to the right side, then to loading half on the right and half on the left, then they were loaded by a different trainer, and into a different trailer. For one subject a limited hold was utilized, as well as a companion horse...|$|E
40|$|Resistance in {{the horse}} to <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> is a common source of stress and injury to horses and their handlers. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether nonaversive training based on the Tellington-Touch Equine Awareness Method (TTEAM; Tellington-Jones & Bruns, 1988) would decrease loading time and reduce stress during loading for horses with a history of reluctance to load. Ten horses de-scribed by their owners as “problem loaders ” were subjected to pretraining and posttraining assessments of loading. Each assessment involved two 7 -min loading at-tempts during which heart rate and saliva cortisol were measured. The training con-sisted of six 30 -min sessions over a 2 -week period during which the horse and owner participated in basic leading exercises with obstacles simulating aspects of trailering. Assessment showed heart rate and saliva cortisol increased significantly during load-ing as compared to baseline (p <. 001 and p <. 05, respectively). Reassessment after training showed a decrease in loading time (p <. 02), reduced heart rate during loading (p <. 002), and reduced saliva cortisol as compared to pretraining assessments. Seven “good loaders ” also were subject to loading assessment for physiological compari-son. Increases in heart rate during loading were significantly higher in the good load-ers (p <. 001). Nonaversive training simulating aspects of loading may effectively re-duce loading time and stress during loading for horses with a history of resistance to <b>trailer</b> <b>loading.</b> Accidents related to trailering horses are a common source of injury to both horses and people handling horses. Many of these injuries occur while loading and unloading the horse from a trailer. The most common problem is the horse who refuses to enter the trailer. The ensuing struggle can lead to injury (Houpt...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether a positive handling had a stress reducing effect on beef cattle. Eight finishing bulls {{were randomly assigned}} to a handling group and a control group. The handling group received 10 times 4 minutes of positive handling, spread over 5 weeks before slaughter. After 5 weeks avoidance distance had decreased in the handling group, but not in the control group. No differences in behaviour were observed during <b>trailer</b> <b>loading.</b> Handled animals showed less stress-indicating behaviour when entering the stunning box. Blood samples were taken before handling sessions and one day before slaughter and during exsanguinations. Cortisol-, lactateand glucose concentrations were elevated in sting blood of all animals. Control animals showed higher lactate and glucose concentrations in sting blood than handled animals. In meat quality tests control animals showed higher cooking losses than handled animals. Those results imply that a calmative handling in the forefront of slaughter can decrease animals’ stress reactions at slaughter...|$|E

50|$|Expeditions {{were offered}} with an {{adaptive}} pneumatic air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and <b>trailer</b> <b>load</b> leveling capability from 1997 to 2013. For the 2014 model year, a Nivomat adaptive hydraulic suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and <b>trailer</b> <b>load</b> leveling replaced the pneumatic system. Both systems can automatically detect when a heavy trailer is coupled, {{such as a}} travel trailer, and level the load. Additional ride-height sensors placed {{on the left and}} right sides of the SUV also monitor and compensate for any listing caused by improper cargo loading. This keeps the Expedition running straight and level while towing, and at night helps to keep the Expedition's headlamps from blinding oncoming traffic.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{effective}} method for <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> horses based on principles of positive reinforcement. Target training and shaping were used to teach trailer-loading behavior to 5 quarter horse mares in a natural setting. All 5 had been trailer loaded before through the use of aversive stimulation. Successive approximations to loading and inappropriate behaviors were the dependent variables. After training a horse to approach a target, the target was moved to various locations inside the trailer. Horses started training on the left side of a two-horse trailer. After a horse was loading on the left side, she was moved to the right side, then to loading half on the right and half on the left. A limited-hold procedure and the presence of a companion horse seemed to facilitate training for 1 horse. Inappropriate behaviors fell to zero immediately after target training, and all the horses successfully completed the shaping sequence. Finally, these effects were observed to generalize to novel conditions (a different trainer and a different trailer) ...|$|E
40|$|Paper revised from {{original}} submittal. Rickett et al. 11 - 2236 1 Intermodal freight generates one of {{the highest}} sources of revenue among all traffic types transported by North American railroads. Intermodal trains, however, use equipment that is not aerodynamically efficient compared to other types of rolling stock, and typically operate at higher speeds, creating significant aerodynamic drag. This high resistance associated with the movement of intermodal trains results in significant annual operating expenses in the form of fuel expenditures. However, opportunities exist to reduce the aerodynamic drag through improved equipment design and loading practices. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is developing a machine vision system to evaluate intermodal train energy efficiency based on container and <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> arrangement, the gap lengths between them, and the type of rolling stock used. A prototype machine vision system has been installed at BNSF Railway’s Logistics Park Chicago facility to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. This machine vision system consists of a camera, computer, and machine vision algorithms. The algorithms separate the train from the background and detect the edges of the containers and trailers to identify an...|$|E
40|$|The {{bells of}} Iowa State {{are among the}} most iconic symbols of the university. Alumni and fans enjoy {{listening}} to the Campanile, but because they may be located throughout the nation, most are unable to come to campus to hear them. Design is currently underway to build a one-fifth scale travelling Campanile-Carillon to visually reflect the landmark and will be playable just as the original. The carillon will be more accessible in comparison to the Campanile so the general public can operate it and see how the bell mechanisms work. This will instill an interest and appreciation for music, engineering, and the history of this antique instrument. It will also be used to attract more students to continue their higher education at Iowa State University. But in order for this model to safely and reliably travel across the country, logistics need to be established. All potential trailers and pallet jacks were analyzed to determine the best suited option. Additionally, the setup, teardown, and <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> procedures have been developed to maintain a safe environment and increase efficiency. The hope of this project is to bring the bells of Iowa State to the rest of Iowa and the nation...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of a tractor-trailer system {{moving up and}} down sloping ground under different operating conditions was theoretically simulated. A computer program was developed to analyze the system to predict the effect of both the <b>trailer</b> <b>loading</b> weight and the slope angle on the tractor stability, traction ability, and drawbar loading. The program was used to analyze a tractor-trailer system moving at uniform motion up and downhill. The results of this analysis showed that the tractor becomes unstable when towing a 3750 kg trailer uphill at 28 ° slope angle. Insufficient traction occurred at slope angles ranging from 15 ° to 18 ° corresponding to trailer weight of 3750 to 750 kg. The parallel component of drawbar pull reached a maximum value of 17318 N when the trailer was pushing the tractor downhill at 30 ° slope angle. The normal component (normal to the tractive surface) showed similar maximum values for both uphill and downhill motions of the system. The use of computer analysis in this study provided a significant improvement in predicting the effect of different parameters on stability and control of tractor-trailer combination on sloping ground...|$|E

40|$|The {{concern over}} late season {{grape berry moth}} (GBM) damage has {{prompted}} growers and processors in the Lake Erie region grape industry {{to take a closer}} look at the management strategies available to them and the economics of the direct berry damage caused by this pest. The goals of this project are to look at the parasitic wasp, Trichogramma ostriniae, to determine if it would parasitize grape berry moth eggs in the field and to look at the economics of late season losses to this pest and how they relate. An oversimplification of the ‘economics of’ GBM damage is whether a load is rejected at the processing plant. While a <b>trailer</b> <b>load</b> of $ 200 a ton ‘Concords’ would result in a loss of $ 4, 000 it is well understood in the industry that many times this <b>trailer</b> <b>load</b> is taken home, reworked, and passed through inspection on the second try.
