5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett notes <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> of {{the surf}} music reference. In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to contributing to the soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, {{who claimed to have}} met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> that the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E

A further distinction is made between <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of policy and <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of practice, <b>the</b> latter characterized by the strategies used by headteachers and teachers as they adapt policy to practice and as they represent these adaptations as fulfilling accountability requirements.

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> that having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{count of}} those killed during the uprising was 260 people; historians place the number of dead higher. The Zimbabwe National Army suffered no fatal casualties. Binda calls the battle the RAR's greatest victory, writing that the troops were greatly outnumbered, but won through superior professionalism and discipline. Several analysts comment on <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> that Mugabe and ZANU–PF were saved from a major rebellion by white-led ex-Rhodesian troops. The battle was the RAR's last; its personnel were reassigned to other units when it was disbanded later in 1981. The rebellion's defeat, meanwhile, prompted mass desertions by ZIPRA guerrillas fearing retribution from the Mugabe administration. Indeed, the uprising partially fuelled Mugabe's bloody Gukurahundi campaign against Matabeleland later in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E

5|$|In North Carolina, {{there was}} often a {{strategy}} of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This {{was the result of}} the initiative of D.E. Hudgins Jr, a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for school desegregation.|$|E
5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E

40|$|Learning {{literature}} gives {{a chance}} to see the world outside and a mirror to see insight. This study uses a novel by Jane Austen, Emma for she is a great woman novelist with outstanding achievement. She wrote the life around her as it was. Emma is one of her works that presents an ironic fiction. Emma confirms Jane Austen’s achievement as the perfect ironist to make her heroine have experience that makes her behave within a double vision of judgment. Related to that this study tries to find <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> in Emma and also categorize them into their forms. In the findings of <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> and categorizing them into their forms, this study includes some theories related to irony which are verbal irony dramatic irony, and situational irony, twist of face irony, and point of view irony. This study is aimed at <b>the</b> findings of <b>ironies</b> that can happen in the relationship of the main character Emma Woodhouse with the other characters. However, this study limits the findings to find <b>the</b> three major <b>ironies</b> which are verbal irony dramatic irony and situational <b>irony.</b> To help <b>the</b> analysis of the novel, the writer used the literary analysis and the intrinsic approach. The writer also used Roberts & Jacobs’ and Perrine’s three major classifications of irony, verbal irony, dramatic irony, and situational irony as a parameter to the findings. From the analysis, <b>the</b> verbal <b>ironies</b> are found in various forms. The characters in the novel use <b>the</b> verbal <b>ironies</b> using comparison, illustration, ambiguity and contrast, and overstatement. They are used to get certain purposes and intentions. Comparison is used to belittle someone {{and at the same time}} to get rid off him out of one’s head. Illustration is useful to persuade and to drive someone to do what one wants. Ambiguity can be a means to address someone indirectly and to deceive. Contrast is used to show what one feels because of someone. Overstatement can be used to refuse an idea with deceive reasons. There are four dramatic ironies and four situational <b>ironies</b> found. <b>The</b> dramatic <b>ironies</b> and <b>the</b> situational <b>ironies</b> happen mostly due to misinterpretation self-delusion and blunders of the main character, Emma Woodhouse. Eventually, from the analysis made it can be concluded that verbal irony can be useful to get particular purposes. To find <b>the</b> dramatic <b>irony</b> needs sensitivity to understand sentences and what they imply. And <b>the</b> situational <b>irony</b> reminds that an expectation does not always meet reality. Human traits also give contribution to irony...|$|R
