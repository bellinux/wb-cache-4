30|$|We {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>shattering</b> {{processes in}} <b>the</b> {{same way as}} in H 10 by solving <b>the</b> <b>shattering</b> equation. <b>The</b> collision frequency between grains with various sizes is determined by grain-size-dependent velocity dispersions. <b>The</b> <b>shattering</b> equation used in H 10 is based on Hirashita and Yan (2009) (originally taken from Jones et al., 1994, 1996). Shattering is assumed to take place if the relative velocity between a pair of grains is larger than <b>the</b> <b>shattering</b> threshold velocities, vshathat (2.7 and 1.2 km s− 1 for silicate and graphite, respectively; Jones et al., 1996). The results are not sensitive to vshat {{as long as the}} grain velocities driven by turbulence is much larger than the threshold, but are rather sensitive to the hardness of the grain materials as shown later.|$|R

5|$|Advance Wars: Days of Ruin was {{intended}} to have a darker atmosphere and more serious tone {{in contrast to the}} previous installments in the series, and features a new storyline independent of the previous games. Set amidst a post-apocalyptic world, the story focuses on the Rubinelle 12th Battalion, one of the surviving remnants of the military of the country of Rubinelle, which had been locked in a century-long war with its rival, Lazuria, prior to a devastating global meteor shower. In the aftermath, the Battalion devotes itself to saving any other survivors of the disaster, despite <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> nations renewing their war against each other and an uncurable disease ravaging both sides. Meanwhile, a mysterious faction with unknown motives takes advantage of the destruction and pushes both sides deeper into conflict from behind the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{troops from}} the 7th Division were already {{fighting}} in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign when the re-formed 2/3rd Battalion, along with the 2/5th Battalion and the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment, were committed as reinforcements, to help bring the 7th Division up to strength. In a bitter campaign that lasted 28 days, Vichy French forces attempted to resist the Allied invasion, which had been launched in order to deny the Germans the use of Vichy territory to launch attacks against Egypt. Against a modest Allied force with only limited armour and artillery, the well-equipped French force outnumbered the attackers and {{had the advantage of}} holding the mountainous terrain. Having contributed a company to garrison duties around Sidon in Lebanon, and provided 100 men to help re-form <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> 2/1st Battalion, the 2/3rd was understrength– consisting of only 21 officers and 385 other ranks– when it entrained at Majdal in Palestine on 18 June 1941 to join the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} from Gallipoli, the AIF was re-organised in Egypt. This saw the splitting of the veteran battalions to provide cadres for new battalions as the AIF's infantry divisions in Egypt were doubled. As {{a part of}} this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 47th Battalion, and the 4th Brigade became part of the Australian 4th Division. After a further period of training, in June 1916 the battalion sailed for France aboard the transport Transylvania. After landing at Marseilles, the 15th Battalion moved to northern France via rail to Beilleul, moving into the line around Bois Grenier for a brief period on 15 June. Amidst the carnage of the Battle of the Somme which was launched in July, the following month, the 15th Battalion was committed to fighting on the Western Front for the first time, entering the line around Pozières on 5 August, as the 4th Division relieved <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> 2nd.|$|E
5|$|French {{losses on}} Mercure, {{although}} unknown exactly, were severe, only three sailors surviving. Weasel, despite being engaged {{with three different}} French ships for a considerable time, had not one man killed or wounded during the entire engagement. Rivoli's scattered escorts were not pursued, British efforts being directed instead at bringing <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> Rivoli back to port as a prize. As a result, the remaining French ships {{were able to make}} their way to friendly ports unopposed. Rivoli was a new and well-built ship and, following immediate repairs at Port St. George, she and Victorious traveled together to Britain. There they were both repaired, Victorious returning to the fleet under Talbot for service against the United States Navy during the War of 1812, and Rivoli commissioned as HMS Rivoli for service in home waters.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E

The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, they not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. North Koreans had also approached Yongsan from the south. That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E

5|$|Rowley {{dismissed}} {{this idea}} given <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> state of Africaine and instead towed the frigate back to Île Bourbon, shadowed by Astrée and Iphigénie {{on the return}} journey. The French frigates did achieve some consolation in pursuing Rowley from a distance, running into and capturing the Honourable East India Company's armed brig Aurora, sent from India to reinforce Rowley. On 15 September, Boadicea, Africaine and the brigs arrived at Saint Paul, Africaine sheltering under the fortifications of the harbour while the others put to sea, again seeking to drive away the French blockade but unable {{to bring them to}} action. Bouvet returned to Port Napoleon on 18 September, and thus was not present when Rowley attacked and captured the French flagship Vénus and Commodore Hamelin at the Action of 18 September 1810.|$|E
5|$|The British {{airborne}} forces landed {{some distance from}} their objectives and were quickly hampered by unexpected resistance– especially from elements of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. Only a small force was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge while {{the main body of}} the division was halted on the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, XXX Corps was unable to advance north as quickly as anticipated due to the destruction of the bridge at Son, and failed to relieve the airborne troops according to schedule. After four days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and the rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket north of the river– where they could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles or XXX Corps when they arrived on the southern bank, nor by the RAF's resupply flights. After nine days of fighting, <b>the</b> <b>shattered</b> remains of the British 1st Airborne Division were withdrawn in Operation Berlin.|$|E

Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry was sent to Anui to the north, where it was attacked and pushed back repeatedly by the North Korean 4th Infantry Division. On July 31, the North Korean 6th Infantry Division struck Chinju, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, forcing them to withdraw east. This left the southern entries to Pusan open, but the North Korean 6th Division was unable to exploit it due to its extended supply line. The 6th Division eventually advanced further east, attempting to capture the city of Masan, but newly reorganized troops of the US Army repulsed them and inflicted heavy casualties on them less than a week later during the Battle of the Notch.|$|E
