5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E
5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved. Sometimes a mandoline is used <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> vegetables for vegetable chips, which can accommodate thin slicing and enhance size consistency. Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, sea salt, pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|Stir frying: Stir frying is a Chinese cooking {{technique}} used for preparing {{food in a}} wok. It originates from the Han Dynasty, but did not fully develop until the Song Dynasty. Although there are no surviving records of Han Dynasty stir frying, archaeological evidence of woks and the tendency <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> food thinly indicate that the technique was likely used for cooking. It {{was not until the}} Ming Dynasty that stir frying was popularized as primary cooking method of Chinese cuisine. Stir frying was brought to America by early Chinese immigrants, and has been used for non-Asian cuisines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{obfuscation}} aims {{to transform}} a program, without affecting its functionality, {{so that some}} secret information within the program can be hidden {{for as long as}} possible from an adversary armed with reverse engineering tools. Slicing is a reverse engineering technique which aims to produce a subset of a program which is dependent on a particular program point and is used to aid in program comprehension. Thus slicing could be used as a way of attacking obfuscated programs. Can we design obfuscations which are more resilient <b>to</b> <b>slicing</b> attacks? In this paper we present a novel approach to creating obfuscating transforms which are designed <b>to</b> survive <b>slicing</b> attacks. We show how we can utilise the information gained from <b>slicing</b> a program <b>to</b> aid us in manufacturing obfuscations that are more resistant <b>to</b> <b>slicing.</b> We give a definition for what it means for a transformation <b>to</b> be a <b>slicing</b> obfuscation and we illustrate our approach with a number of obfuscating transforms...|$|R

5|$|The {{failed attempt}} to kill Bond while at Royale-Les-Eaux was {{inspired}} by Fleming's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen, Vice-Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler. Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts, carried out by Bulgarians, because trees protected them from the blasts. The torture scene in which Bond's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French-Moroccan torture technique, , in which the steel string of a mandolin was used <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> in half the testicles of British wartime agents.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E

Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E

25|$|The Brachiosauridae are {{composed}} of quadrupedal dinosaurs that are generally very large, {{with the exception of}} the possible insular dwarf Europasaurus. The brachiosaurids can be distinguished from other macronarian taxa by their broad, thick and spoon-shaped teeth. Their maxillary teeth were twisted apically, at the top, and the shape of these teeth was optimal for biting off resistant vegetation. While brachiosaurids, like other sauropods, did not perform significant food processing in their mouths, their teeth enabled them <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> through food instead of having to pull it off of tree branches. Evidence for this precision shearing consists of apical wear facets on the teeth and distinctive bone structure that suggests orthal, vertical, jaw action.|$|E
25|$|Ploughing leaves {{very little}} crop residue on the surface, which {{otherwise}} could reduce both {{wind and water}} erosion. Over-ploughing {{can lead to the}} formation of hardpan. Typically farmers break up hardpan up with a subsoiler, which acts as a long, sharp knife <b>to</b> <b>slice</b> through the hardened layer of soil deep below the surface. Soil erosion due to improper land and plough utilisation is possible. Contour ploughing mitigates soil erosion by ploughing across a slope, along elevation lines. Alternatives to ploughing, such as the no till method, have the potential to actually build soil levels and humus. These may be suitable to smaller, more intensively cultivated plots, and to farming on poor, shallow or degraded soils that ploughing would further degrade.|$|E

This is confirmed by the remarkable preservation of her gut content. Furthermore, the lack of a baculum (penis bone) found in all lower primates means that the fossil was from a female.

The scientists speculate whether she was overcome by carbon dioxide fumes while drinking from the Messel lake. Hampered by her broken wrist, she slipped into unconsciousness, was washed into the lake and sank to the bottom, where unique fossilisation conditions preserved her for 47 million years.|$|E
