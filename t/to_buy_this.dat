The maiden flight of the second development batch aircraft, XR220, was due {{on the day of the}} announcement, but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down, coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation, it never happened. Ultimately, only the first prototype, XR219, ever took to the air. A week later, the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.|$|E

She decides <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>this</b> for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces the nurses at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at the nurses for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, the nurses blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E

The Bureau in charge, which became known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was placed under the continuing supervision of the military because Congress anticipated the need to defend black settlements from White Southerners. The bill implicitly rejected plans by Lincoln and others to colonize blacks abroad, or even in segregated regions of the United States—its mandate would have institutionalized black landownership of the same land that had formerly relied on their unpaid labor.|$|E

500|$|The late 18th century saw the {{nationalisation}} {{of royal}} or princely art collections across mainland Europe. The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) {{opened to the}} public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery), and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793. Great Britain, however, did not emulate the continental model, and the British Royal Collection remains in the sovereign's possession today. In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature, when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>this</b> [...] "invaluable treasure" [...] and suggested that it be housed in [...] "a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum" [...] Nothing came of Wilkes's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now {{to be found in the}} State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg.|$|E
500|$|Decay {{received}} a weak but overall positive reception from the video games industry's critics. Writing for GameSpot, Doug Radcliffe argued that Decay was [...] "impressive", praising {{the design of}} puzzles required players to work together, {{as well as the}} way in which the ranking system discouraged players from competing against each other. GameSpy's David Hodgson was more reserved in his views of the game; although describing it as [...] "great fun", he noted that it could become [...] "tedious, with one member waiting for minutes at a time, while the other scratches their head, then completes an objective". In addition, Hodgson felt that the more puzzle-orientated nature of Decay left the action elements [...] "a little muted compared to Gordon's single player quest". Allgame described Decay as an [...] "added bonus" [...] for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life, but noted that as the game was designed for two players, it significantly suffered when a single player attempts to play it by switching between two characters, a point that both GameSpy and GameSpot agreed on. In his review for IGN, citic Doug Perry felt that Decay was [...] "neat in its own limited way", but that it was more of a distraction from the main game, [...] "a complementary cup of vegetable soup than a piping hot main dish of New York steak". While The Electric Playground reviewer Steve Smith stated that the control scheme for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life [...] "is about the best we have seen on the PS2 or any console", he concluded that although Decay was a [...] "nice add-on", it was [...] "no reason <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>this</b> port".|$|E

500|$|By Your Side was {{generally}} well received by critics. [...] Regarding the songwriting, most reviewers praised The Black Crowes for {{returning to the}} straightforwardness of Shake Your Money Maker (1990) following the more adventuresome Amorica (1994) and Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] Gemma Tarlach of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel welcomed the album [...] "because it represents a great band's return to what it does best", calling it [...] "45 minutes of good, dirty fun". [...] Wall of Sound's Russell Hall found that the band's emergence from [...] "the jam-band haze that's infected" [...] their recent work resulted in a [...] "laser-sharp focus". [...] Mark Falkner of The Florida Times-Union said that beyond the band's mastery of their influences' musical styles, what prevents them [...] "from being just another tribute act {{is that they have}} (also) mastered the power, the passion and the fun that made the mix work". Some critics, also noting the change in approach, derided the band for returning to mine the same influences perceived in their debut album. [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News thus described By Your Side as [...] "a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy" [...] and marked [...] "Go Faster" [...] a sped-up version of Humble Pie's [...] "Hot 'n' Nasty". [...] The Times Nigel Williamson called [...] "HorseHead" [...] "Zeppelinesque" [...] and labeled [...] "By Your Side" [...] "a kicking boogie half way between [...] 'Cindy Incidentally' and [...] 'Tumbling Dice'". [...] Steve Dougherty of People summed up by commenting, [...] "Purists will wonder why <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>this</b> album when [...] 1972 Exile on Main Street or [...] Stewart's 1970 Gasoline Alley exist on CD." ...|$|E
500|$|Late Registration {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 85, based on 31 reviews. Writing for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield deemed the record [...] "an undeniable triumph, packed front to back, so expansive {{it makes the}} debut sound like a rough draft", while calling West [...] "a real MC". Uncut magazine's Simon Reynolds found most of the songs brilliant and highlighted by what he called an unparalleled use of vocal samples by West, while Josh Tyrangiel from Time said the sampling and string arrangements on [...] "Gone" [...] may persuade listeners to believe West's own hype. In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis praised West's topicality and subversive studio production, writing that [...] "Late Registration suggests an artist effortlessly outstripping his peers: more ideas, better lyrics, bigger hooks, greater depth." [...] The Observer viewed the album as a significant milestone in hip hop while calling West [...] "the Brian Wilson of hip-hop" [...] because he [...] "plays up the struggle between conscience and covetousness, the pop mainstream {{and what can be}} achieved within the notional boundaries of hip hop". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times compared West's dignified execution of pop crossover to that of The Beatles, Johnny Cash, and Bob Marley. Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork felt West avoided the sophomore slump with an [...] "expansive, imperfect masterpiece" [...] that drew on his enthusiastic, ambitious, and scattered personality. Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, praised the album's [...] "exquisite details", both lyrical and musical, and concluded that West is [...] "as good as he thinks he is... He wants everybody <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>this</b> record. So do I"; he would later assign it an [...] "A+" [...] grade.|$|E
