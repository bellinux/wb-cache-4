5|$|Alligators {{have created}} a niche in wet prairies. With their claws and snouts they dig at low spots and create ponds free of {{vegetation}} that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. The alligators then feed upon some of the animals that come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> in the ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested {{and the results were}} inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E

Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> is too large, the female plasters it with mud {{to reduce its}} size, and often coats {{the inside of the}} cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} a nocturnal forest-dweller that reproduces once in late March–May {{and once in}} September–December, having one or two young each time. During the day, the mother digs {{a hole in the}} ground, for her young to hide in. At night, she opens the {{entrance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> while watching for predators (such as venomous snakes), and then nurses her young, after which she closes the hole with soil and plant material by thumping on it with her front paws. Amami rabbits sleep during the day in hidden locations, such as caves. They are also noted for having a call similar to that of a pika.|$|E

This technology integrates silicon 2 -D photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides and electrostatically actuated bimorph cantilevers with tips that are self-aligned relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> of <b>the</b> PhC. The bimorph canti-levers modulate the propagation {{properties of the}} slab PhC depending on the proximity of <b>the</b> tips <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> integrated devices have been successfully fabricated on wafer scale by surface micromachining techniques.

25|$|Explorer was designed, {{like most}} ships, with {{compartments}} {{which could be}} sealed off by watertight doors; the ship would not sink if holed and one compartment flooded, but was not safe if more compartments were flooded, either by a gash spanning compartments or imperfect sealing between compartments.

25|$|Forstner bits, {{also known}} as Forstner flange bits or webfoot augers, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to the}} wood grain. Forstner bits can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. Forstner bits were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|E

This whistle is similar in many respects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> tone, in particular the teapot whistle. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops. There are numerous articles on the internet about this whistle and it has been studied.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{announces the}} plan to release a chemical called Agent Yellow into {{the river and the}} surrounding area, hoping it will kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature's sleeping spot but sees no one there. As Gang-du climbs down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm hanging out of its mouth and gives chase, meeting Nam-joo on the way. The creature makes its way to the location where Agent Yellow is released and a large crowd has formed in protest.|$|E
25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> tapered.|$|E
25|$|The diver {{and tender}} {{on the surface}} are {{connected}} by a rope lifeline and harness. The harness is typically put on over the dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even {{if he or she}} must remove the air cylinder or buoyancy control device. The harness fits over the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> The harness should not be able to slide up or down the diver's torso when pulled in line with the body.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons that}} led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2006 {{catastrophe}} remain controversial. Some sources claimed that Uralkali failed <b>to</b> undertake all <b>the</b> necessary work in order <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> in <b>the</b> mines, {{which may have}} directly caused the appearance of <b>the</b> sinkholes. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local newspaper Inaya Gazeta, Rybolovlev, motivated by <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> save money, decided to split in two <b>the</b> budget allocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> filling, which resulted in an insufficient filling of the mines chambers.|$|R
30|$|The {{second step}} {{included}} hole-filling and leakage removal {{by means of}} morphological operators: closing is required <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> on <b>the</b> boundaries of breast mask; filling is required <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> within <b>the</b> breasts; and erosion is required <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> dilation obtained by the closing operation [19, 20].|$|R

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{entities}} {{that need to be}} taught (or programmed): positional data and procedure. For example, in a task to move a screw from a feeder to a hole the positions of the feeder and the hole must first be taught or programmed. Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the feeder <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the feeder ready to be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.|$|E
25|$|These {{devices have}} been studied, and {{reviewed}} by Raman. Here we look primarily at the Hartmann whistle. The shock {{cells of the}} jet interact with the shock {{in front of the}} cavity (the flow in the cavity being subsonic). Small symmetric disturbances in the jet stream are amplified as they proceed toward the cavity (similar in some respects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> tone) causing the shock in front of the cavity to oscillate. The shock front acts much like a piston source of high energy resulting in a monopole-like sound field. Again the volumetric flow is directional unlike the theoretical monopole.|$|E
25|$|Forstner bits, {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to}} the wood grain. They can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|E

25|$|In May 2011, Westwood contested {{a playoff}} at the BMW PGA Championship with fellow Englishman {{and at the}} time world number two Luke Donald. On the par five 18th, Donald hit his {{approach}} shot into the green leaving six feet for birdie. Westwood attempted to follow him in close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> but got too much backspin on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double bogey. Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E
25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole),</b> and the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{feature of}} this whistle is that the tone sounds only with flow through the orifice from outside; it is an {{acoustical}} diode. A cylindrical cavity with a small circular, square-edged hole {{at one end and}} totally open at the other is known to generate a tone when air is passed through it. It is subject to frequency jumps and hysteresis loops similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> tone. There appear to be two stages and the feedback is likely Class II if the tube is short. The fundamental tone occurs near λ=4L, so one characteristic dimension is L, the length of the tube. The characteristic speed U is that of the flow through the hole.|$|E
