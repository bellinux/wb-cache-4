30|$|To {{promote the}} {{assessment}} of patient-important outcomes, patients’ follow-up should be extended but this can be hampered by logistical issues (organization of phone call, medical consultation, etc.) which can considerably increase {{the costs of the}} study. As a result, we found that patients’ follow-up was short since only 12 % of trials assessed primary outcomes beyond 30  days from randomization. Patient-important outcomes were initially promoted to evaluate outcomes of chronic diseases [13, 15] for which patients’ follow-up is easier to perform because <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> <b>cared</b> for by the same medical team. This situation is quite different for critically ill patients who are often cared for by a different team after ICU discharge. The advent of post-ICU consultation [50] could foster a better assessment of patient-important outcomes by intensivists and researchers in the field.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} medical costs of hemodialysis, CAPD and renal {{transplantation}} in our {{patients with chronic}} renal failure. The cost per patient averaged 660, 000 yen for hemodialysis (760, 000 yen for CAPD) {{in the first month}} when dialysis was started and 460, 000 yen for routine maintenance hemodialysis (240, 000 yen for CAPD). There was a difference in cost between recipients treated with conventional immunosuppressants (conventional group) and those receiving cyclosporine (Cs-group). That is, the estimated average cost for the conventional group was 3, 800, 000 in the first month after kidney grafting and at 60, 000 yen in the subsequent months when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>is</b> <b>cared</b> for at the outpatient clinic; that of Cs-group was at 2, 710, 000 yen and 170, 000 yen. This difference is due to the high cost of cyclosporine. The cumulative cost of maintenance hemodialysis is on a constant linear increase. Recently, clinical results of renal transplantation have improved markedly. Furthermore, our analysis of questionnaires to patients shows that renal transplantation is far superior to hemodialysis on the aspect of the quality of life. Thus, renal transplantation should be promoted further, and then the combined treatment of a low dose of cyclosporine and other immunosuppressants might be recommended to reduce the cost of cyclosporine...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: For the {{treatment}} of chronic sepsis of the hip in paraplegic patients, we adopted three mea-sures: (1) a Girdlestone procedure, (2) transposition of the vastus lateralis muscle into the void that was left by {{the removal of the}} femoral head and neck and the ace-tabular wall, and (3) external fixation to prevent unre-strained motion of the femoral shaft, which might damage the transposed muscle. The hip joint was spanned by a posterior pelvic-femoral skeletal external fixator. Nine patients, all of whom had thoracic-level paraplegia, were treated in this manner. The fixator was kept in place for three to six weeks while <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>were</b> <b>cared</b> for in <b>the</b> prone position.

He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|R

It also discusses how this evidence-based information on {{infection prevention and control}} impacts care of patient in routine anaesthesia practice. This review underscores the role played by us, anaesthetists in formulating guidelines, implementing the same, monitoring the outcome and training post-graduate trainees and coworkers in this regard. The article re-emphasises that certain guidelines when followed strictly {{will go a long way}} in reducing transmission of hospital acquired infection between patient and anaesthetist or between patients. Anaesthetists do not restrict their work to operating room but are involved in disaster management, interventional radiological procedures and in trauma care.
