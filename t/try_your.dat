500|$|Various other titles were {{suggested}} {{for the series}} such as Cardcaster Sakura and Card Character Sakura before Nekoi suggested Cardcaptor Sakura. While Ohkawa planned out Cardcaptor Sakura from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so {{it would look like}} {{she was in love with}} Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of [...] "if you <b>try</b> <b>your</b> best, it'll work out", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's [...] "It'll definitely be okay" [...] mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that [...] "minorities would feel comfortable with," [...] referring to the same-sex and taboo relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.|$|E
2500|$|The first Chinese {{historical}} archive {{also recorded}} that on 4 September 1730 AD (on the lunar calendar), Tian Wenjing, {{governor of the}} Eastern River, fell ill. Emperor Yongzheng sent a royal doctor to visit and provided him with 200g of GuilingJi. In red calligraphy it was written: [...] "Please <b>try</b> <b>your</b> best to recover. You should have told me sooner. Why are you looking all over? Here is your reward.” Imperial records show that Emperor Yongzheng usually rewarded ministers with only 5g of GuilingJi. By rewarding Tian Wenjing with not only 200g, but also the original GuilingJi prescription it showed the emperor highly valued Tian Wenjing.|$|E

'He's easy to get along with.' 'He can be pleasant.' 'He's nice and very competent.' Only one lawyer criticized , saying, ' tough, and can be aggressive and impatient.' Garson also received good ratings for his legal knowledge, administration of his courtroom, and handling of trials and settlements. He was rated [...] "approved" [...] by the local bar association. In 2001, he was applauded by feminists for ordering an Orthodox Jewish man to pay his ex-wife $500-a-week for life, because the man refused to grant her a religious divorce, or get.|$|E
