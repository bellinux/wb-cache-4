5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook. The core ingredient of a traditional cholent is beef, usually shoulder, brisket, flanken, or any other cut that becomes tender and flavorful in long slow cooking. The meat is placed in a pot with peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture is lightly seasoned, mainly salt and pepper, and water is added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> to create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E
25|$|Scrapple is {{typically}} made of hog offal, {{such as the}} head, heart, liver, and other trimmings, which are boiled with any bones attached (often the entire head), to make a broth. Once cooked, bones and fat are removed, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, black pepper, and others are added. The mush is formed into loaves and allowed to cool thoroughly until set. The proportions and seasoning are very {{much a matter of}} the region and the cook's taste.|$|E

30|$|Initially, {{seedlings}} of charentais melon (No {{resistance to}} Fusarium wilt) were planted in 20 -cm-diameter pots containing 2.5  L of sterile substrate [Plantaflor PROFI TYP 3]. The haliscosamine was dissolved in DMSO and solutions of 1 % and 2 % were prepared in the irrigation water. Then, <b>the</b> <b>pots</b> were irrigated {{for two days}} by each of these solutions. On the third day, a 7 -d-old FOM culture grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pots</b> containing plants. Pathogen inoculum which consisted of a mixture of conidia and chlamydospores, was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>potting</b> mix {{at a rate of}} 1000 propagules/g of substrate (Suárez-Estrella et al. 2007). Each treatment consisted of five replicate pots of five plants per pot. Disease was monitored for 6  weeks. Stem sections of all seedlings were destructively harvested and surface disinfected in 0.5 % household bleach (0.0026 % sodium hypochlorite) and placed on PDA <b>to</b> confirm <b>the</b> presence of the pathogen. Results were shown as the total percentage of seedlings infected with the pathogen.|$|R
25|$|The NFL sent a {{confidential}} and detailed memo to all 32 teams detailing its findings. It {{revealed that the}} Saints had not only targeted Warner and Favre during the 2009 playoffs, but had also targeted Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton during the 2011 regular season. According to that memo, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma offered $10,000 cash to any teammate who knocked Favre out of the NFC Championship Game. Another source told CBSSports.com's Mike Freeman that Reggie Bush's agent at the time, Michael Ornstein, was closely involved in the scheme from the beginning.

25|$|The game {{is divided}} {{into a series of}} hands (deals); at the {{conclusion}} of each hand, the pot is typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the pot is divided between two or more is discussed below). A hand may end at the showdown, in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more {{in the case of a}} tie. The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand occurs when all but one player have folded and have thereby abandoned any claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> in which case the pot is awarded to the player who has not folded.|$|E
25|$|A nine-point game {{is another}} variant of match play {{typically}} played among threesomes, where each hole {{is worth a}} total of nine points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives five points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth four points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth two points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth three points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format {{can be used to}} wager on the game systematically; players each contribute {{the same amount of money}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.|$|E

500|$|Gumbo {{is cooked}} {{for a minimum}} of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned {{beforehand}} and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. [...] Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. [...] When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> along with water and/or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste. [...] According to Nobles, [...] "proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> {{until the end of the}} process. [...] As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, filé powder is added last.|$|E
500|$|Archaeologists {{have found}} {{evidence}} of textile dyeing {{dating back to the}} Neolithic period. In China, dyeing with plants, barks and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. The essential process of dyeing changed little over time. [...] Typically, the dye material is put in a pot of water and then the textiles to be dyed are added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> which is heated and stirred until the color is transferred. [...] Textile fibre may be dyed before spinning ("dyed in the wool"), but most textiles are [...] "yarn-dyed" [...] or [...] "piece-dyed" [...] after weaving. Many natural dyes require the use of chemicals called mordants to bind the dye to the textile fibres; tannin from oak galls, salt, natural alum, vinegar, and ammonia from stale urine were used by early dyers. [...] Many mordants, and some dyes themselves, produce strong odors, and large-scale dyeworks were often isolated in their own districts.|$|E
500|$|In {{anticipation}} of particularly high viewership {{due to the}} Super Bowl, NBC officials encouraged The Office producers to feature celebrity guest appearances in the episode. Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman all made guest appearances in [...] "Stress Relief" [...] as a result. However, they do not interact with the cast and characters of The Office, but rather appear separately in a bootleg film called Mrs. Albert Hannaday, which the characters watch within the episode. Greg Daniels said this was done because it [...] "helps keep the show grounded and less like I Love Lucy". Lieberstein also said the casting decision made sense because, [...] "If we're just casting some salesman that comes {{into the office and}} it's Jack Black, it's hard to believe that." [...] "Stress Relief" [...] marked Black's fourth television appearance in five years: he previously appeared in the Fox sitcom Cracking Up in 2004, the Comedy Central series The Naked Trucker and T-Bones Show in 2004, and the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons in 2007.

It determined that Williams had initiated the fund soon after he arrived in New Orleans in 2009, in hopes of making the defense more aggressive. Between 22 and 27 Saints defensive players were involved. The players and Williams contributed their own cash <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> and received cash payments based on their performance in the previous week's game. For instance, a special teamer who downed a kick returner inside the receiving team's 20-yard-line earned $100. Players could also be fined for mental mistakes and penalties. Players also received [...] "bounties" [...] for [...] "cart-offs" [...] (plays in which an opponent was removed from the field on a stretcher or cart) and [...] "knockouts" [...] (plays that resulted in a player being unable to return {{for the rest of the}} game). Players usually earned $1,000 for [...] "cart-offs" [...] and $1,500 for [...] "knockouts" [...] during the regular season, though they were encouraged to put their winnings back into the pot in order to raise the stakes as the season went on. Payments were known to double or even triple during the playoffs.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} fish to pots is poorly understood {{but is a}} vital component of the fish capture process. Here, the behaviour of gadoids prior to and after capture in different baited fish pot designs was observed using in situ video footage. Bottom set and floated/lifted versions, respectively, of a collapsible and of a rigid pot were compared. A low entrance and high escape rate limited cod (Gadus morhua) catches, whilst a low encounter rate limited saithe (Pollachius virens) catches. Both species approached pots by swimming upstream. Cod tended to encounter and inspect pots more than saithe, which showed more cautious responses, characterised by a reluctance <b>to</b> inspect <b>the</b> <b>pots</b> at close range. Cod were thus more likely <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> <b>pots,</b> and these differences in behaviour explain the observed differences in capture efficiency between the species. Once inside <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> cod showed slow swimming (milling) and tended <b>to</b> search <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> walls in attempts to escape. Saithe tended to hang still and {{were less likely to}} escape than cod. With regards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of <b>pot</b> design on behaviour, cod encountered pots less when they were floated/lifted above the seabed whilst saithe encountered floated and bottom set <b>pots</b> at <b>the</b> same rate. Entrance and escape rates for both species were not affected by floating collapsible <b>pots</b> above <b>the</b> seabed. The probability of capture for a fish was dependant on species and fish size, as well as social attraction and repulsion effects from other fish already caught. The findings of this study have important implications for future pot design and optimisation and contribute towards efforts to establish a pot fishery for gadoids in Norway...|$|R
