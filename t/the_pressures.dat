5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic {{activity}} and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E
30|$|The {{combination}} of different reservoir boundary conditions has different {{effects on the}} template curve. Figure  11 shows that the boundary condition mainly affects the boundary dominated flow stage. For the closed boundary condition, the value of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> drop tends to be stable, and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> derivative is about 0.01. For <b>the</b> constant <b>pressure</b> boundary condition, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> is continuously propagating and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> derivative is gradually reducing due to the sufficient supply of external energy until <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> equals to <b>the</b> boundary <b>pressure,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> derivative slope is about 1, and the reservoir fluid develops quasi-steady state seepage. When the upper (lower) boundary is closed, and <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of lower (upper) boundary is constant, then <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> change is between the above two cases. In this situation, only <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> derivative slope is not a constant.|$|R

5|$|After {{performing}} at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations {{for their next}} studio album, Young Modern. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region, and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson) and Julian Hamilton (The Presets, The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> faced previously when working with a record label.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach {{focuses on the}} links between this form of castle {{and what can be}} termed a feudal mode of society. The spread of motte-and-bailey castles was usually closely tied to the creation of local fiefdoms and feudal landowners, and areas without this method of governance rarely built these castles. Yet another theory suggests that the design emerged as a result of <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> of space on ringworks, and that the earliest motte-and-baileys were converted ringworks. Finally, there may be a link between the local geography and the building of motte-and-bailey castles, which are usually built on low-lying areas, in many cases subject to regular flooding. Regardless of the reasons behind the initial popularity of the motte-and-bailey design, however, there is widespread agreement that the castles were first widely adopted in Normandy and Angevin territory in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the simulation, fabrication and characterization of a micro FET (field effect transistor) pressure sensor with readout circuits. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor includes 16 sensing cells in parallel. Each sensing cell that is circular shape {{is composed of}} an MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) and a suspended membrane, which the suspended membrane is the movable gate of the MOS. The CoventorWare is used to simulate the behaviors of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor, and <b>the</b> HSPICE is employed to evaluate the characteristics of <b>the</b> circuits. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor integrated with circuits is manufactured using the commercial 0. 35 μm CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) process and a post-process. In order to obtain the suspended membranes, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor requires a post-CMOS process. The post-process adopts etchants to etch the sacrificial layers in <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors to release the suspended membranes, and then the etch holes in <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor are sealed by LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposition) parylene. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor produces a change in current when applying a <b>pressure</b> to <b>the</b> sensing cells. The circuits are utilized to convert the current variation of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor into <b>the</b> voltage output. Experimental results show that <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor has a sensitivity of 0. 032 mV/kPa in <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> range of 0 - 500 kPa...|$|R
5|$|Archaeological, {{linguistic}} and anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} Taiwan's indigenous peoples have undergone a series of cultural shifts to meet <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> of contact with other societies and new technologies. Beginning in the early 17th century, Taiwanese aborigines faced broad cultural change as the island became incorporated into the wider global economy by a succession of competing colonial regimes from Europe and Asia;. In some cases groups of aborigines resisted colonial influence, but other groups and individuals readily aligned with the colonial powers. This alignment could be leveraged to achieve personal or collective economic gain, collective power over neighboring villages or freedom from unfavorable societal customs and taboos involving marriage, age-grade and child birth.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a factor in his decision, along with <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding.

5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes.

The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. <b>The</b> <b>pressures</b> and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E
