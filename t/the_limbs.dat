5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. <b>The</b> <b>limbs</b> were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} a limb can be {{measured}} with a laser rangefinder and clinometer if both end points of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> are visible from a point beneath the end of <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> <b>The</b> vertical distance is measured {{to the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> directly over <b>the</b> measuring point at an angle of 90 degrees. The inclination and distance {{to the other end of}} <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> where it emerges from the trunk are then measured. The straight line length of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> from trunk to tip can then be calculated using the Law of Cosines.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the neural}} {{control and the}} {{mechanics}} of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> contribute to its overall stiffness.

5|$|Exercise also {{increases}} the respiratory rate, partly {{in response to}} the movement of <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> detected by proprioceptors in the muscles and joints, an increase in body temperature, the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) from the adrenal glands, and from motor impulses originating from the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Guttate {{psoriasis}} {{is characterized}} by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, droplet-like lesions (papules).

Guttate psoriasis is often triggered by a streptococcal infection, typically streptococcal pharyngitis. The reverse is not true.|$|E
5|$|January 4/5, 1879: At Jacksonville at 7 pm, sleet began, {{which turned}} to rain 90minutes later. The {{freezing}} rain covered trees, shrubbery, {{and everything else}} outdoors by morning.

50|$|Maintain <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> mesenchyme in a mitotically {{active state}} {{and focused on}} its task - the distal {{outgrowth}} of <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> This is achieved by secretion of FGF8, which signals <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> mesodermal cells to continue proliferation, and secreting FGF10, which winds up maintaining the AER.|$|R
40|$|Myogenic cells migrate into <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> from <b>the</b> somitic mesoderm, {{taking up}} {{positions}} in the dorsal and ventral compartments before differentiating into <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> musculature. This process {{is influenced by the}} tissues of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> in a number of ways. Cells of the lateral part of the somitic dermomyotome are induced to express a migratory myogenic phenotype by a diffusible signal originating in <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> bud mesoderm. <b>The</b> <b>limb</b> and body wall musculature are entirely derived from cells of this migratory myogenic lineage. Components of the extracellular matrix of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> mesoderm, such as fibronectin, facilitate myogenic cell migration by providing sites for adhesion and directed migration. Differences in the composition of the matrix along the proximo-distal axis make the distal mesoderm more attractive for migrating myogenic cells. Anterior-posterior movement of myogenic cells within <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> bud is highly restricted, resulting in a regionalised contribution of cells to <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> musculature based on somitic origin. Lastly, there is a process that excludes myogenic cells from the most distal region of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> bud mesoderm; a similar process is involved in the aggregation of myogenic cells into the dorsal and ventral premuscle masses. These findings illustrate the high degree of control over myogenic cell migration mediated by both diffusible factors and the extracellular matrix in <b>the</b> developing <b>limb</b> mesenchyme...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>limbs</b> of {{the horse}} are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in <b>the</b> <b>limbs,</b> allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. <b>The</b> <b>limbs</b> play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
50|$|One form of {{treatment}} {{that has produced}} a more integrated body awareness is mirror therapy, {{in which the individual}} who denies that <b>the</b> affected <b>limb</b> belongs to their body looks into a mirror at <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> Patients looking into the mirror state that <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> does belong to them; however body ownership of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> does not remain after the mirror is taken away.|$|R
50|$|Muscle cocontraction (similar {{to muscle}} tone) {{is able to}} vary the {{stiffness}} of a joint {{by the action of}} antagonistic muscles acting on the joint. The stronger the forces of the antagonistic muscles on the joint are, the stiffer the joint becomes. The selection of body posture also affects the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> By adjusting <b>the</b> orientation of <b>the</b> <b>limb,</b> <b>the</b> inherent stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> can be manipulated. Additionally, the stretch reflexes within a <b>limb</b> can affect <b>the</b> stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>limb,</b> however these commands are not sent from the brain.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> longest <b>limb</b> is {{measured}} from the collar where it {{emerges from a}} trunk to its farthest horizontal extent. It {{should also be noted}} if <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> is self-supporting or if it is touches the ground somewhere along its length. The length of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> may also be measured along the contours of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> itself. If easily accessible this can be accomplished by simply using a tape measure. If <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> cannot be reached then remote measurement methods need to be used. There are several viable measurement techniques that can provide us with useful information about limb extension.|$|R
5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> was also mottled brown while the rear {{surfaces of the}} thighs were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} {{appearance of}} Auriga in Greek mythology is as <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> of Medea's brother.

Each individual star represents a different limb.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
50|$|Leverett has {{developed}} a methodology where {{the length of a}} limb is measured using a monocular w/reticle aligned along the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>limb,</b> <b>the</b> distance to either end of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> segment, and a calculated scaling factor to determine <b>limb</b> length. Essentially <b>the</b> apparent length of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> at each end as using the distance to that point and the scaling factor for that distance as if <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> were perpendicular to the observer. These lengths are considered to be the top and base of a regular trapezoid with a height equal to the difference in the distance between the two points. The true length of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> can then be calculated by treating it as a diagonal of the trapezoid.|$|R

5|$|In birds, {{the main}} arteries taking blood {{away from the}} heart {{originate}} from the right aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms {{this part of the}} aorta.

5|$|On land, {{the river}} otter can walk, run, bound, or slide. Foot falls during walking and running follow the {{sequence}} of left limb, right limb, right limb, left limb. During walking, <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> are moved in a plane parallel to the long axis of the body. Bounding {{is the result of}} simultaneous lifting of <b>the</b> <b>limbs</b> off the ground. As the front feet make contact with the ground, the back feet are lifted and land where the front paws first contacted the ground, producing a pattern of tracks in pairs typical of most mustelids. Sliding occurs mostly on even surfaces of snow or ice, but can also occur on grassy slopes and muddy banks. Sliding across snow and ice is a rapid and efficient means of travel, and otters traveling over mountain passes, between drainages, or descending from mountain lakes often slide continuously for several hundred meters. Rear leg paddling enables continuous sliding where gravity is an insufficient or an opposing force. During winter, the river otters heavily use openings in the ice, and may excavate passages in beaver dams for accessing open water.|$|E
5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, {{alternate}} hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than <b>the</b> <b>limbs,</b> {{is used for}} stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed above water. It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{embryonic}} {{development in}} chick, axons pause in a plexus region for approximately 1  day prior to invading <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> We have previously shown that this “waiting period” {{is governed by}} maturational changes in <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> Here we provide {{a detailed description of}} the spatiotemporal pattern of Raldh 2 expression in lumbosacral motoneurons and in <b>the</b> <b>limb,</b> and show that retinoid signaling in <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> contributes significantly to terminating the waiting period. Raldh 2, indicative of retinoid signaling, first appears in hindlimb mesenchyme near the end of the waiting period. Transcripts are more abundant in connective tissue associated with predominantly fast muscles than predominantly slow muscles, but are not expressed in muscle cells themselves. The tips of ingrowing axons are always found in association with domains of Raldh 2, but development of Raldh 2 expression is not regulated by the axons. Instead, retinoid signaling appears to regulate axon entry into <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> Supplying exogenous retinoic acid to proximal <b>limb</b> during <b>the</b> waiting period caused both motor and sensory axons to invade <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> prematurely and altered the normal stereotyped pattern of axon ingrowth without obvious effects on limb morphogenesis or motoneuron specification. Conversely, locally decreasing retinoid synthesis reduced axon growth into <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> Retinoic acid significantly enhanced motor axon growth in vitro, suggesting that retinoic acid may directly promote axon growth into <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> in vivo. In addition, retinoid signaling may indirectly affect the waiting period by regulating the maturation of other gate keeping or guidance molecules in <b>the</b> <b>limb.</b> Together these findings reveal a novel function of retinoid signaling in governing the timing and patterning of axon growth into <b>the</b> <b>limb...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{transcription}} factor Pitx 2 c {{is expressed in}} primordial visceral organs in a left-right (L-R) asymmetric manner and executes situs-specific morphogenesis. Here we show that Pitx 2 c is also L-R asymmetrically expressed in <b>the</b> developing mouse <b>limb.</b> Human PITX 2 c exhibits the same transcriptional activity in <b>the</b> mouse <b>limb.</b> <b>The</b> asymmetric expression of Pitx 2 c in <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> also exhibits dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior polarities, being confined to the posterior-dorsal region of <b>the</b> left <b>limb.</b> Left-sided Pitx 2 c expression in <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> is regulated by Nodal signaling through a Nodal-responsive enhancer. Pitx 2 c is expressed in lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) –derived cells in <b>the</b> left <b>limb</b> that contribute to various <b>limb</b> connective tissues. <b>The</b> number of Pitx 2 c+ cells in <b>the</b> left <b>limb</b> {{was found to be}} negatively regulated by Pitx 2 c itself. Although obvious defects were not apparent in <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> of mice lacking asymmetric Pitx 2 c expression, Pitx 2 c may regulate functional L-R asymmetry of <b>the</b> <b>limb...</b>|$|R

30|$|In this section, the {{accuracies}} of <b>the</b> <b>limb</b> fitting {{and pointing}} correction are evaluated by simulating <b>the</b> Venusian <b>limb</b> observed by <b>the</b> cameras (Ogohara et al. 2012).
