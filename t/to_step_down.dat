5|$|During a {{televised}} {{address to the}} nation on 7 September 2004, Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>down</b> after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards. An example of the failure, cited by the OSCE, was the pre-marking of ballots. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.|$|E
5|$|Following Governor Madison's death, Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd offered <b>to</b> <b>step</b> <b>down</b> if Slaughter {{preferred}} to appoint {{someone else to}} the post.

Slaughter did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope, however, apparently as a political favor. This move proved disastrous for Slaughter's political career. Todd was very popular {{by virtue of being}} the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby.
