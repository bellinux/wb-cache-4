40|$|The first-person pronoun “I” {{refers to}} a {{particular}} individual as the speaker producing an utterance, and second-person “you” {{refers to a}}nother individual to whom the speaker directs <b>the</b> utterance.

This paper aims to establish the contention that the first-person pronoun “I” refers to the speaker as the addresser of an illocutionary act, and the second-person pronoun “you” refers to the hearer as the addressee of the illocutionary act. This clarifies the discursive function of the personal pronouns: they indicate participants of the illocutionary act performed in the discourse. Identifying the indicating function of personal pronouns makes it possible to analyze Japanese personal pronouns and the formality level of the discourse, which are generally assumed to be a problem case, in a consistent manner...|$|R

Here, I examine how two hillslope processes dominant in the Oregon Coast Range, debris flows and deep-seated landslides, affect valley floor width and channel slope, key components of the geomorphic template in riverine ecosystems. I then investigate how patterns in potential salmon habitat differ between streams dominated by deep-seated landslides and streams dominated by debris flows. I show that terrain influenced by deep-seated landslides exhibits (1) valley widths that are more variable throughout the network but less locally variable, (2) more variable channel slopes, and (3) more potential salmon habitat as well as significantly more connectivity between habitat types...|$|R

40|$|Water plays a {{major role}} in bio-systems, greatly {{contributing}} to determine their structure, stability and even function. It is well know, for instance, that proteins require a minimum amount of water to be functionally active. Since the biological functions of proteins involve changes of conformation, and sometimes chemical reactions, it is natural to expect a connection of these functions with dynamical properties of the coupled system of proteins and their hydration water. However, despite many years of intensive research, the detailed nature of protein - hydration water interactions, and their effect on the biochemical activity of proteins through peculiar dynamical effects, is still partly unknown. In particular, models proposed so far, fail to explain the full set of experimental data. <b>The</b> <b>well-accepted</b> 'protein dynamical transition' scenario is based on perfect coupling between the dynamics of proteins and of their hydration water, which has never been confuted experimentally. We present high-energy resolution elastic neutron scattering measurements of the atomistic dynamics of the model protein, lysozyme, in water that were carried out on the IN 16 B spectrometer at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France. These show for the first time that the dynamics of proteins and of their hydration water are actually de-coupled. This important result militates against <b>the</b> <b>well-accepted</b> scenario, and requires a new model to link protein dynamics to the dynamics of its hydration water, and, in turn, to biochemical function.
