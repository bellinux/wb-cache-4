5|$|Major repairs {{were carried}} out {{beginning}} in 1825. The floor-level was raised above flood-level, a full three feet. The roof was rebuilt, the south wall was rebuilt using the original materials, and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the 12th-century chancel arch were discarded.|$|E

5|$|For five days, on December 16–20, 1911, the University {{celebrated its}} 300th Anniversary. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> {{of the celebration}} included: a Solemn High Mass {{in honor of the}} founder of the University, Miguel de Benavides; the {{unveiling}} of the commemorative plaque for the festivities; the unveiling of a plaque placed at the pedestal of the statue of Benavides in the College site in Intramuros; the laying of the foundation stone for the future building at University in Sampaloc; and a big banquet.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{movies are}} entirely {{driven by the}} meet-cute situation, and {{contrived}} circumstances throw the couple together {{for much of the}} screenplay. However, movies in which the contrived situation is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature,</b> such as Some Like It Hot, rather than the romance being <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature,</b> are not considered [...] "meet-cutes".|$|R

5|$|From its beginning, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of {{the metric}} system were the {{standard}} set of interrelated base units {{and a standard}} set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could replace {{a huge number of}} other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E

There is a small moraine in the valley of Hemlock Run, a tributary of West Branch Fishing Creek.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of late Roman {{fortification}} clearly presage {{those of}} medieval castles. But the defensibility of late Roman forts {{must not be}} exaggerated. Late Roman forts were not always located on defensible sites, such as hilltops {{and they were not}} designed as independent logistic facilities where the garrison could survive for years on internal supplies (water in cisterns or from wells and stored food). They remained bases for troops that would sally out and engage the enemy in the field.|$|E
5|$|The Sandals farm {{contains}} three cottages {{dated to}} the 17th century. Heather Cottage is another 17th-century cottage, with 20th-century {{additions to the}} rear, on Worldham Hill, noted for its thatched roof. It {{is believed to be}} named after William Heather, a resident mentioned in the 1665 Hearth Tax returns. It became a listed building on 18 July 1986. The Three Horseshoes Public House was first licensed in 1834 and is one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the village. It was rebuilt some 50 years later by Henry Newman. Also of note is the Rectory House on Wyck Lane, and the Oast House, just {{to the west of the}} rectory.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>features</b> of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E

5000|$|If {{you hear}} the word B-movie, you will {{probably}} laugh heartily, but a B-movie director has his own worries. In newspaper ads <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature</b> usually has <b>the</b> most prominent place, and I'm way down at the bottom. The B-movie director's biggest worry is the question 'What effect will <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature</b> have that is shown before your film?' Films from Nikkatsu usually have the same plot: <b>the</b> <b>main</b> character {{falls in love with}} a woman, he kills the bad guy and gets the woman. This pattern is repeated in every film, so you concentrate on finding out all you can about who the actors are, who the director is, and the approach this director has. This is what the B-movie director does. For instance, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature's</b> director has a habit of filming a love scene a certain way; this means that I have to handle it in another way. The director of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature</b> has it easy. He doesn't have to find out how I work at all. He can just do whatever he wants. So actually a B-movie director has a harder task than his colleague who does <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>feature.</b> Because of this the studio should give me more money than him, actually, but it's just the other way around.|$|R
