5|$|On 21 May 1887, two new {{buildings}} were completed {{at the hospital}} and the Prince and Princess of Wales came <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them</b> officially. Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his rooms for an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a Christmas card each year.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to bring it back to life.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E

It was <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> them"--he {{seemed to}} make it out, as he smoked, with his eyes still on the stars. He might in quiet sport have been reading their horoscope. Strether {{wondered}} meanwhile what had been <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and he finally let him have it. [...] "It was <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> simply to let me alone; to have made up their minds, on really seeing me for themselves, that I could go on well enough as I was." ...|$|R

5|$|The first open {{clash between}} the mutineers and {{officers}} {{came on the}} morning of 3 December, when a small group of sailors gathered on the forecastle and, refusing orders to leave, began to argue with the officers. Captain Eyles asked to know their demands, which were an assurance that Temeraire would not go to the West Indies, but instead would return to England. Eventually Rear Admiral Campbell came down to speak to the men, and having informed them that the officers did not know the destination of the ship, he ordered them to disperse. The men went below decks and the incipient mutiny appeared to have been quashed. The ringleaders, numbering around a dozen, remained determined however, and made discreet inquiries among the rest of the crew. Having eventually determined {{that the majority of the}} crew would, if not actually support a mutiny, at least not oppose it, and that the Temeraires crew would be supported by the ship's marines as well as the crews of some of the other warships in Bantry Bay, they decided to press ahead with their plans. The mutiny began with the crew closing the ship's gunports, effectively barricading themselves below deck. Having done so, they refused orders <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them</b> again, jeered the officers and threatened violence. The crew then came up on deck and once again demanded to know their destination and refused to obey orders to sail for anywhere but England. Having presented their demands they returned below decks and resumed the usual shipboard routine as much as they could.|$|E
25|$|In February 2000, Special Branch and MI5 {{officers}} investigating Islamic terrorism {{raided the}} bookshop, took away books, files and computers, questioned staff and arrested Begg under British anti-terrorism laws. Begg was released without charge. Begg's father said the British government retrieved encrypted files from his son's computer, and ordered Begg <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them,</b> but Begg refused. A {{judge ruled that}} Begg could not be compelled to unlock the files.|$|E
25|$|As {{there was}} a risk of fire from the leaking fuel, the {{commander}} ordered an emergency evacuation of the aircraft. Although the rear doors opened as intended and the evacuation slides deployed, both forward doors required considerable force <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them</b> before all on board could evacuate the aircraft. No injuries were sustained in the evacuation. The investigation subsequently was able to replicate the difficulty in opening both forward doors on the One-Eleven. It was discovered that inadequate guidance from the manufacturer of the escape slides meant that they were incorrectly stowed. One door had an incorrect part fitted. A warning was issued to all One-Eleven operators and the relevant aviation authorities concerning this issue.|$|E

25|$|Their float was {{stocked with}} biscuits, chocolate, Horlicks tablets, Bovril pemmican, 22 gallons (100 litres) {{of water and}} 2 gallons (9 litres) of massage oil for use against exposure. There was also a sail, which they rigged as a {{makeshift}} shelter. After three days of rough weather the sea calmed and the raft drifted. The men's health deteriorated, but the ration cans had keys <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them,</b> and from one of these White improvised a fishing hook. He untwisted the fibres of a rope and made them into a fishing line. With this they caught about 50 fish, which they ate raw. This gave the survivors both protein and nutritious fish oil, which improved their health and did much to keep them alive.|$|E
25|$|On 23 July 2009, the 17:33 {{service to}} Masterton hit a {{mudslide}} blocking the line {{just north of}} Maoribank tunnel near Maymorn. The locomotive, DCP4818, and the first carriage, SWG3422, derailed. Only minor injuries were reported, but the slip and the derailed rolling stock blocked the line, preventing services operating until Sunday evening. The accident highlighted a flaw {{in the design of}} the pneumatically-operated interior doors in the SW carriages, which stuck in position when the compressed air supply was lost as a result of the locomotive being shut down. Three people were needed <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them</b> by hand, sparking concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly in the event of a fire. The doors were modified so they would open automatically if the compressed air supply is lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{rainfall}} {{also caused}} Venustiano Carranza Dam in Coahuila to fill completely; the large water {{pressure in the}} dam forced the dam's gates shut, and cranes were employed <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> The rest of the gates were unable to be opened {{due to lack of}} electrical power, sparking fears of a potential dam overtopping or rupture. The municipality of Anáhuac in Nuevo León was evacuated after reports early on July6 that the dam had overtopped; Anáhuac's municipal president stated that the flood could cause the [...] "total destruction" [...] of the city. On July7, as water releases from the dam were increased to , the town was reported to be [...] underwater, with more discharge expected. Personnel from the Mexican Army and the city's prison population were evacuated from Anáhuac that same day. [...] In San Luis Potosí, the rainfall from Alex was beneficial, as it caused increases in dam water levels of up to 20% in very dry areas.|$|E

When the timid guard refused <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> they announced that one of them was King Sebastian, and so won admittance. One of the three was wrapped in a cloak, his face concealed, and his two companions were observed to show him the deference due to royalty." ...|$|R

500|$|Pellew {{was aware}} that his frigate was heavily outclassed by his much larger opponent, and that Amazon, which was [...] distant, was not large enough to redress the balance when it did arrive. He {{correctly}} assumed, however, that the ocean was too rough to allow Lacrosse to open his lower gunports without the risk that heavy waves would enter them and cause Droits de l'Homme to founder. In fact, the French ship was totally unable to open her lower deck gunports during the action: an unusual design feature had the ports [...] lower than was normal {{and as a result}} the sea poured in at any attempt <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them,</b> preventing any gunnery at all from the lower deck and halving the ship's firepower. Although this reduced the number of available guns on the French vessel, Lacrosse still held the advantage in terms of size, weight of shot and manpower. The French situation was worsened however by the loss of the topmasts: this caused their ship to roll so severely in the high seas that it was far more difficult both to steer the ship and to aim the guns than on the British vessels.|$|E
500|$|... "Worst Episode Ever" [...] {{was written}} by Larry Doyle and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on February4,2001. The episode was originally called [...] "The Fiver", {{a reference to a}} scene in the episode that was eventually removed. The episode title was then changed to [...] "Worst Episode Ever", a title which the staff were amused by. According to Doyle, [...] "Worst Episode Ever" [...] is the first episode in which Comic Book Guy has a major role. Because Comic Book Guy is usually sarcastic and unfriendly, the series' staff found it hard to make the character seem likable. For example, Hank Azaria, who plays Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series, had a difficult time trying to make the character sound sincere. [...] "Comic Book Guy only ever pronounces things sarcastically", Azaria said in the DVD commentary for the episode. [...] "It was hard {{to find a way to}} sound believable and have him say sincere things. It took a lot of different takes." [...] Executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said, [...] "It's tough when you take a character like Comic Book Guy or Krusty or Moe, to make them suddenly sympathetic and vulnerable. You have to cheat the character a little bit <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them</b> up emotionally a little more." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{originally}} delivered, {{the cars}} featured manual [...] "Armstrong" [...] doors, {{a reference to}} the [...] "strong arm" [...] that would be needed by trainmen <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> Near each door, a large lever could be thrown by trainmen to open or close the doors.

2500|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Social Security to millions of Americans, many direct-mail marketers packaged their mailings to resemble official communications from the Social Security Administration, hoping that recipients would be more likely <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them.</b> In response, Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1988 to prohibit the private use of the phrase [...] "Social Security" [...] and several related terms in any way that would convey a false impression of approval from the Social Security Administration. The constitutionality of this law (...) was upheld in United Seniors Association, Inc. v. Social Security Administration, 423 F.3d 397 (4th Cir. 2005), cert den 547 U.S. 1162; 126 S.Ct. 2346 (2006) (text at Findlaw).|$|E
2500|$|The bridge {{has become}} a symbol of the {{transition}} from Devon to Cornwall. In the Great Western Railway's The Cornish Riviera travel guide, SPB Mais regarded it as an almost magic means of transporting travellers from a county, which, if richer than others, is yet unmistakingly an English county, to a Duchy which is in every respect un-English. You shut your eyes going over the Saltash Bridge only <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>them</b> again on a foreign scene.
