5000|$|Another similar skim coating {{is always}} {{done in a}} process called veneer plastering, {{although}} it is done slightly thicker (about 2 mm or 1/8 inch). Veneering uses a slightly different specialized setting compound ("finish plaster") that contains gypsum and lime putty. This application uses blueboard, which has special treated paper to accelerate {{the setting of the}} gypsum plaster component. This setting has far less shrinkage than the air-dry compounds normally used in drywall, so it only requires one coat. Blueboard also has square edges rather than the tapered-edge drywall boards. The tapered drywall boards are used <b>to</b> <b>countersink</b> the tape in taped jointing whereas the tape in veneer plastering is buried beneath a level surface. One coat veneer plaster over dry board is an intermediate style step between full multi-coat [...] "wet" [...] plaster and the limited joint-treatment-only given [...] "dry" [...] wall.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} our study {{demonstrate}} that PETS is a minimally invasive and safe technique for treating LLD by creating a growth inhibition of the longer limb. The screws can {{be placed in a}} parallel or crossed pattern and it may be beneficial <b>to</b> <b>countersink</b> the screw heads, particularly if they are placed in a parallel fashion to decrease the risk of pain from a prominent screw head irritating the soft tissues. Clinicians may use the growth predictor method of choice with the understanding {{that there may be a}} large variability in the result, but usually the variability is not clinically significant. We found that the Green−Anderson and Moseley methods tended to underpredict and the Paley method tended to overpredict the final LLD. Several studies have reported that PETS creates delayed growth inhibition and recommend performing PETS between 6 and 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis [5, 8, 18]. We believe that PETS is reversible by removing the screws and are now performing the PETS 12  months earlier than the estimated optimal timing for epiphysiodesis. We believe that PETS creates growth inhibition by locking the epiphysis to the metaphysis with screw threads on both sides of the growth plate. Although we have not used fully threaded 7.3 -mm cannulated screws, we believe that fully threaded screws would be equally successful and would decrease the problems associated with screw removal.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Presentation date: 2001 - 06 - 01 Twenty-one {{countersunk}} culverts in Oregon were inventoried {{to establish}} baseline {{information for the}} stream crossings so that subsequent resurveys can assess the long-term stability and functionality of the culvert design. A subset of the inventoried culverts was selected for detailed hydraulic measurements. The detailed velocity measurements were used to help derive an empirical model, which will calculate the proportion of a cross-section that is {{less than or equal}} to a particular velocity. The model could be used in the design stages of <b>countersunk</b> culvert installations <b>to</b> determine what proportion of the culvert cross-section will be within a swimming velocity of a fish species and age class of interest at a specific fish passage design discharge. Natural channel roughness equations were examined for application <b>to</b> <b>countersunk</b> culverts, which is a stream simulation design. A weighting factor to account for corrugation roughness along the sides of the culvert is proposed. The roughness equations corresponded well with back-calculated roughness values...|$|R
50|$|A {{flush rivet}} is used {{primarily}} on external metal surfaces where good appearance and {{the elimination of}} unnecessary aerodynamic drag are important. A flush rivet takes advantage of a countersink hole; they are also commonly referred <b>to</b> as <b>countersunk</b> rivets. Countersunk or flush rivets are used extensively on the exterior of aircraft for aerodynamic reasons as it not allow to raise the drag while installed. Additional post-installation machining may be performed to perfect the airflow.|$|R
40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the NACA 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of exposed rivet heads and spot welds on wing drag. Most of the tests were made with an airfoil of 5 -foot chord. The air speed was varied from 80 to 500 miles per hour and the lift coefficient from 0 to 0. 30. The increases in the drag of the 5 -foot airfoil varied from 6 %, due <b>to</b> <b>countersunk</b> rivets, <b>to</b> 27 %, due to 3 / 32 -inch brazier-head rivets, with the rivets in a representative arrangement. The drag increases caused by protruding rivet heads were roughly proportional to the height of the heads. With the front row of rivets well forward, changes in spanwise pitch had negligible effects on drag unless the pitch was more than 2. 5 % of the chord. Data are presented for evaluating the drag reduction attained by removing rivets from the forward part of the wing surface; for example, it is shown that over 70 % of the rivet drag is caused by the rivets on the forward 30 % of the airfoil in a typical case...|$|R

50|$|Once again, {{a process}} for {{producing}} flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an additional axis of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC Plasma Cutting machine can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2 dimensional cutting path. The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost. The angular cutting capability of 3 Dimensional plasma cutting can also be used <b>to</b> create <b>countersunk</b> holes and chamfer edges of profiled holes.|$|R

The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, <b>to</b> form a <b>countersink.</b> The advantage <b>to</b> this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit.

40|$|Four-corner fusion (4 CF) is an {{accepted}} and regularly performed procedure when managing posttraumatic degenerative disorders in the wrist. This procedure consists of excision {{of the entire}} scaphoid in association with midcarpal fusion of the remaining four ulnar carpal bones (hamate, capitate, lunate, and triquetrum). In the majority of cases, the long-term outcome is a functional painless wrist. However, the exact procedure to best achieve a rapid solid bone union of the fusion mass without hardware complications remains controversial. The authors have developed a precise system to ensure precise positioning, firm fixation, and fusion at the midcarpal joint together with an early postoperative recovery, avoiding {{some of the issues}} reported with other implants used for 4 CF. The described implant is a circular plate accommodating variable angle locking screws as well as compression screws that can firmly fix the plate to the carpal bones. The locking technology produces a very solid construct. A special reaming-distraction-compression guide has also been developed <b>to</b> both <b>countersink</b> the plate on the underlying carpal bone mass and allow distraction of the midcarpal joint for debridement and cancellous bone graft interposition.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. The adhesively bonded layered {{aluminum}} {{is used in}} aircraft {{structures to}} avoid knife edge situations when flush head fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. Due <b>to</b> the <b>countersunk</b> hole and adhesive bonding, stress flow becomes more complicated. Extensive knowledge of the different parameters that affect {{the behavior of the}} bonded joints with countersunk holes is essential for dependable and effective design. A 3 -D finite element model was used to estimate the location and magnitude of stress concentration under remote tension for the aforementioned problem. The influence of the various parameters on stress concentration was investigated for a counter sunk angle of 100 º. Different parameters such as ratio of young‟s modulus of adhesive to aluminum, position of adhesive layer, countersunk sunk depths, ratio of thickness to radius and ratio of width to radius have been addressed in this study. The stress flow varies significantly when the plates are filled with fasteners of different pre-tension loads. Also the effects of pre-tension loading were compared for the cases of open hole and fastener filled hole without pre-tension for bonded, monolithic and straight shank hole. The results obtained from the finite element analysis for the monolithic cases have been validated against those reported in literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of fatigue cracks in fastener holes in aircraft structures {{has been an}} area of concern for many years. There has been considerable research devoted to improving nondestructive inspection techniques {{in order to reduce}} the minimum detectable crack size, and in particular, detecting cracks under installed fasteners. This paper describes results obtained using one of these. An ultrasonic shear wave technique was used <b>to</b> systematically inspect <b>countersunk</b> fastener holes in aluminum plates with a variety of simulated fatigue cracks of known dimensions at one of three known locations (countersink, mid-bore or faying surface). In addition to unflawed specimens, a total of thirty coupons, ten with each type of flaw, was studied. Briefly, in this study the test specimens were mounted so that the known crack plane was oriented normal to the transducer axis. A 70 ° angle of incidence ultrasonic shear wave was used and the resulting reflections from the flaws were measured. All data were acquired using commercially-available, immersion C-scan instrumentation and a highly-focussed 25 MHz transducer. After preliminary experimentation, a set of instrument settings was selected and each of the thre...|$|R
