The buggies features independent suspension, long-travel shock absorbers, and covered <b>transmission</b> and radio <b>compartment</b> to keep them running in extreme conditions. For a 2WD buggy, the rear tires are spiked for traction, while the front tires are thin, and ribbed for good steering in dirt. On a 4WD buggy, all four tires are identical, spiked tires. They are designed specifically for dirt, and running on pavement wears the spikes down quickly.|$|R

The vehicle has a conventional layout similar to western designs like the German TPz Fuchs with the driver's and commander's compartment at the front part of the hull, the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>compartment</b> in the middle, and the troop compartment at the rear. The troops enter and leave the vehicle either through the rear doors or the roof hatches, and the driver and the commander are provided with doors located {{on the sides of}} the hull.|$|E
50|$|Morozov's {{new medium}} tank design {{received}} a skeptical response. It {{was believed that}} putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods. It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment {{for the purpose of}} enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and fan drive, it also solved many problems. The cover of the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>compartment</b> turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass {{to the center of the}} hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted. The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76.2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. No significant improvements were made to the hull. Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the steering clutch. Visibility from the driver's position was improved. The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording. The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground.|$|E

40|$|During {{outbreaks}} of {{classical swine fever}} (CSF), CSF virus (CSFV) can be transmitted via different routes. Understanding these transmission routes is crucial in preventing the unlimited spread of the virus in a naïve population, and the subsequent eradication of the virus from that population. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to quantify virus <b>transmission</b> within a <b>compartment,</b> differentiating between <b>transmission</b> within a pen, transmission between pens via contact through (open) pen partitions, and transmission via the air. Furthermore, the possible contribution of each of these routes to infection of individual pigs was quantified. A CSFV outbreak was mimicked in a compartment housing 24 pigs in six different pens. Two pigs in one pen were inoculated with the moderately virulent Paderborn strain, and virus transmission to other pigs was followed in time. Virus transmission rates for transmission via the air (ß of 0. 33 (0. 14 – 0. 64) per day) and transmission between adjacent pens (ß of 0. 30 (0 – 0. 88) per day) were comparable, but significantly lower than for virus transmission within a pen (ß of 6. 1 (0. 86 – 18) per day). The route via the air created new focal points of infection, from which virus transmission continued through other routes. This shows that, at least within a <b>compartment,</b> <b>transmission</b> via the air is expected to play a relevant role in the fast spread of the virus after an initial slow start. This will have consequences for efficacy of intervention measures, including vaccination during an outbreak...|$|R

In this paper we present the analysis of ray optics refracted inside nano rods and at the boundaries between rods, which separates rod gap is {{much smaller than the}} incident wavelength assumed to reflect on the region. In operation, the resolving numerical aperture was compared with the finite difference time domain method via OptiFDTD software. Although numerical aperture mentioned above was found to be extremely close to fiber optics, a <b>transmission</b> passes though <b>compartments</b> of the rods are observed due to significant estimation of transmission and reflection of electric field. The compared simulation results will be discussed. By the aforementioned is that in the near future we will modify wave equation in periodic media of waveguide structures reached to the transverse electric equation of beam propagation in the two-dimensional Photonic crystal waveguide analysed...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{reduction}} is mostly limited to light helicopters whose noise signature {{is dominated by}} their tail rotors. It is primarily hardware oriented. Well known noise reduction techniques such as reduction of rotor speeds with an accompanying increase in solidity to maintain performance, engine noise reduction {{with the use of}} exhaust mufflers, and acoustic blanketing of <b>transmission</b> and engine <b>compartment</b> are used. The concept of blade phasing as a means of reducing tail rotor noise is also used. Engine noise (exhaust noise), power train noise and airframe noise becomes important at low rotor tip speeds and means must be found to reduce these noise sources if further noise reductions are desired. The use of a special test rig aids in isolating the various noise sources and arriving at the penalties (performance or payload) involved in quieting them. Significant noise reduction are achieved for the light helicopter with minimum performance or weight penalties because of the dominance of a single noise source (the tail rotor) ...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{with the}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often {{subclinical}} {{in the presence}} of a healthy immune response; thus, asymptomatic infection is largely uncharacterized. This study analyzed the nature of EBV infection in 20 asymptomatic immunocompetent hosts over time through the identification of EBV strain variants in the peripheral blood and oral cavity. A heteroduplex tracking assay specific for the EBV gene LMP 1 precisely identified the presence of multiple EBV strains in each subject. The strains present in the peripheral blood and oral cavity were often completely discordant, indicating the existence of distinct infections, and the strains present and their relative abundance changed considerably between time points. The possible transmission of strains between the oral cavity and peripheral blood compartments could be tracked within subjects, suggesting that reactivation in the oral cavity and subsequent reinfection of B lymphocytes that reenter the periphery contribute to the maintenance of persistence. In addition, distinct virus strains persisted in the oral cavity over many time points, suggesting an important role for epithelial cells in the maintenance of persistence. Asymptomatic individuals without tonsillar tissue, which is believed to be an important source of virus for the oral cavity, also exhibited multiple strains and a cyclic pattern of <b>transmission</b> between <b>compartments.</b> This study revealed that the majority of patients with infectious mononucleosis were infected with multiple strains of EBV that were also compartmentalized, suggesting that primary infection involves the transmission of multiple strains. Both the primary and carrier states of infection with EBV are more complex than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|The global plan of {{reducing}} the number of new child HIV infections and a {{reduction in the number of}} HIV-related maternal deaths by 2015 will require inordinate political commitment and strengthening of health systems in Sub-Saharan Africa where the burden of HIV infections in pregnant women is the highest. Preventing HIV infection in women of child-bearing age and unwanted pregnancies in HIV-positive women forms the cornerstone of long-term control of paediatric HIV infections. To achieve the goal of eliminating paediatric HIV infection by 2015, health systems strengthening to address prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission cascade attrition and focusing on the elimination of breastmilk transmission is critical. Understanding the pathogenesis of breastmilk transmission and the mechanisms by which antiretroviral therapy impacts on <b>transmission</b> through this <b>compartment</b> will drive future interventions. Identifying and retaining HIV-positive pregnant women in care and committed to long-term antiretroviral therapy will improve maternal outcomes and concomitant reductions in maternal mortality. Research assessing the natural history of HIV infection and long-term outcomes in women who interrupt antiretroviral therapy post-weaning is urgently required. Data on the outcome of women who opt to continue the long-term use of antiretroviral therapy after initiating therapy during pregnancy will determine future policy in countries considering option B+. The prevalence of antiretroviral resistance and impact on survival in infants who sero-convert whilst receiving neonatal prophylaxis, or are exposed to maternal HAART through breastmilk at a population level, are currently unknown. In addition to the provision of biomedical interventions, healthcare workers and policy makers must address the structural, cultural and community issues that impact on treatment uptake, adherence to medication and retention in care...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Translocation of {{nanoparticles}} (NP) {{from the}} pulmonary airways into other pulmonary compartments or the systemic circulation is controversially {{discussed in the}} literature. In a previous study it was shown that titanium dioxide (TiO 2) NP were "distributed in four lung compartments (air-filled spaces, epithelium/endothelium, connective tissue, capillary lumen) in correlation with compartment size". It was concluded that particles can move freely between these tissue compartments. To analyze whether the distribution of TiO 2 NP in the lungs is really random or shows a preferential targeting we applied a newly developed method for comparing NP distributions. Methods Rat lungs exposed to an aerosol containing TiO 2 NP were prepared for light and electron microscopy at 1 h and at 24 h after exposure. Numbers of TiO 2 NP associated with each compartment were counted using energy filtering <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy. <b>Compartment</b> size was estimated by unbiased stereology from systematically sampled light micrographs. Numbers of particles were related to compartment size using a relative deposition index and chi-squared analysis. Results Nanoparticle distribution within the four compartments was not random at 1 h or at 24 h after exposure. At 1 h the connective tissue was the preferential target of the particles. At 24 h the NP were preferentially located in the capillary lumen. Conclusion We conclude that TiO 2 NP do not move freely between pulmonary tissue compartments, although they can pass from one compartment to another with relative ease. The residence time of NP in each tissue compartment of the respiratory system depends on the compartment and the time after exposure. It is suggested that {{a small fraction of}} TiO 2 NP are rapidly transported from the airway lumen to the connective tissue and subsequently released into the systemic circulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to examine effects of prolonged (3 h) intermittent shortening (amplitude 2 mm) contractions (muscles were excited maximally) of head III of rat extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL III) on indices of muscle damage and on force transmission within the intact anterior crural compartment. Three hours after the EDL III exercise, muscle fibre damage, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of structural proteins (i. e. dystrophin, desmin, titin, laminin- 2), was found in EDL, tibialis anterior (TA) and extensor hallucis longus (EHL) muscles. The damaged muscle fibres were not uniformly distributed throughout the muscle cross-sections, but were located predominantly near the interface of TA and EDL muscles as well as near intra- and extramuscular neurovascular tracts. In addition, changes were observed in desmin, muscle ankyrin repeat protein 1, and muscle LIM protein gene expression: significantly (P < 0. 01) higher (1. 3, 45. 5 and 2. 3 -fold, respectively) transcript levels compared to the contralateral muscles. Post-EDL III exercise, length-distal force characteristics of EDL III were altered significantly (P < 0. 05) : at high EDL III lengths, active forces decreased and the length range between active slack length and optimum length increased. For all EDL III lengths tested, proximal passive and active force of EDL decreased. The slope of the EDL III length-TA + EHL force curve decreased, which indicates a decrease {{of the degree of}} intermuscular interaction between EDL III and TA + EHL. It is concluded that prolonged intermittent shortening contractions of a single head of multi-tendoned EDL muscle results in structural damage to muscle fibres as well as altered force <b>transmission</b> within the <b>compartment.</b> A possible role of myofascial force transmission is discussed. © Springer 2005...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleus accumbens}} septi {{is the major}} target of mesolimbic {{dopamine}} neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area of the mesencephalon. Studies involving experimental manipulation of dopamine transmission by drugs and by lesions, {{as well as in}} vivo monitoring of extracellular dopamine concentrations, have provided evidence that the dopamine transmission of the nucleus accumbens {{plays an important role in}} behaviour motivated by conventional (e. g., food, sex) and drug reinforcers. Motivated behaviour is distinguished into an appetitive (preparatory/anticipatory) phase consisting of flexible response patterns intended to search and approach the reward itself, and a consummatory phase, consisting of fixed response patterns (eating, drinking, copulating, etc.) finalized to the utilization of the biological resources of the reward (caloric, metabolic, genetic, etc.). While some studies reported a stimulation of dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens in relation to appetitive as well as consummatory behaviour, other studies reported a relationship exclusively with consummatory behaviour. Therefore, the precise relationship between dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens and specific phases of motivated behaviour is debated. On the basis of topographical, histochemical and connectional evidence, the nucleus accumbens has been subdivided into two compartments, a medioventral "shell" and a laterodorsal "core". This heterogeneity may be relevant to the current debate over the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in behaviour. Thus, one might hypothesize that, depending on the specific compartment of the nucleus accumbens where dopamine transmission is monitored, a different relationship with specific stimuli which motivate behaviour is obtained. In order to verify this possibility we monitored by microdialysis the changes in dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell and core during appetitive and consummatory phases of behaviour motivated by food. As food we utilized a palatable snack food (Fonzies) whose consumption has been shown in previous studies from our laboratory to release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens shell and in the medial prefrontal cortex. Unpredicted consumption of Fonzies preferentially stimulated dopamine transmission in the shell as compared to the core. Appetitive food stimuli (perforated Fonzies-filled boxes) phasically stimulated dopamine transmission in the core but not in the shell and sensitized the dopamine response to feeding in the core but inhibited that in the shell. These clear-cut differences between nucleus accumbens shell and core suggest that phasic dopamine <b>transmission</b> in each <b>compartment</b> of the nucleus accumbens subserves different roles in motivated behaviou...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} principle {{of life is}} the separation of environments into different compartments. Prokaryotes shield their interior from the environment by a plasma membrane {{and in some cases}} also by a cell wall. Eukaryotes refine this compartmentalization by building different organelles for different parts of the cell metabolism. Nevertheless, these different compartments are dependent on each other and are interconnected by membrane proteins that transport specific nutrients, hormones, ions, water and waste products across the membrane and facilitate signal <b>transmission</b> between different <b>compartments.</b> Understanding the structure and function of membrane proteins can therefore allow an enormous insight into the regulation of different metabolic pathways. The electron microscope (EM) proved itself a great tool for studying membrane proteins, offering the unique opportunity to image membrane proteins within a lipid bilayer as close to the natural conditions as possible. Processing of images acquired by an electron microscope poses a challenging task for both scientist and processing hardware. Newly developed and optimized algorithms are needed to improve the image processing to a level that allows atomic resolution to be achieved regularly. Membrane proteins pose a difficult challenge for a structural biologist. To crystallize membrane proteins into well ordered two dimensional (2 D) or three dimensional (3 D) crystals {{is one of the most}} important prerequisites for structural analysis at the atomic level, yet membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to crystallize. One exception may be bacteriorhodopsin, which forms near-perfect crystals already in its native membrane. This may explain the fact that the first 2 D electron crystallographic structure determined at 7 Å resolution by Henderson and Unwin[20][43] in 1975 was the structure of bacteriorhodopsin. In 1990 the structure of Br was determined to atomic resolution by Henderson et al. [19], being the first atomic structure of a membrane protein. The structure determination of Br was also the starting point for the mrc program suite, which is widely used at the moment in the, albeit small, 2 D electron crystallography community. Using the mrc software Kühlbrandt et al. [26] solved the structure of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex in 1994. For recording the images they used the spot scan technique developed by Downing in 1991 [9]. The first aquaporin water channel determined was aquaporin 1, resolved by Walz et al. in 1997 [45] at 6 Å resolution, and subsequently solved to atomic resolution by Murata et al. in 2000 [29]. Recently, several more aquaporin structures were determined by 2 D electron crystallographic methods, aquaporin- 0 (AQP 0) by Gonen et al. in 2004 [14] at 3 Å and in 2005 [13] at 1. 9 Å and aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) by Hiroaki et al. in 2006 [22]. Interestingly, AQP 4 shows exactly the same monomer arrangement as SoPIP 2; 1. The recent publications show that the trend goes from recording solely images to the recording of diffraction data in combination with images or even to recording diffraction data exclusively, and then using methods developed for x-ray crystallography to obtain the phase information. Given the fact that the software available for processing of 2 D electron diffraction patterns is less evolved than the one for processing images, and given this new development of increased usage of diffraction patterns, it only makes sense to focus on implementing new and improved programs for 2 D electron diffraction processing. In this work I would like to present the advances I achieved in the structural determination of aquaporin 2, as well as my contribution to other projects, in particular the structural investigations of SoPIP 2; 1 and KdgM. I will also explain the modified sample preparation methods which made data recording at high tilt angles more reliable and achieved an improvement in resolution of the measured data. A second, equally important and detailed part of my thesis is the work invested in improving and extending the image processing to a point where a user, not adept in programming in several languages, can use it and produce good results. For this I improved the functionality and performance at several points, including a strong emphasis on user friendliness and ease of maintenance...|$|R
