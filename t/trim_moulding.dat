50|$|After 1942, Packard {{concentrated}} on the new Clipper styling that was developed for an upper-class sedan the previous year. There were Super Clippers and Custom Super Clipper in the One-Sixty and One-Eighty tradition until 1947. After a heavy facelift, the name Clipper was dropped. The most senior Super Eight One-Eighty became the Custom Eight, while its slightly lower-priced sibling, the Super Eight One-Sixty, once again became simply the Super Eight. Clipper Custom Super Eights and Custom Eights were very close relatives to their respective Super models, distinguished outside {{by the lack of}} an eggcrate grille and small rear chrome <b>trim</b> <b>moulding</b> under the trunk lid on Supers. In 1949, a new Super Eight Deluxe was added to the line. This car had also the Custom Eight's eggcrate grille, but not the rear trim.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the stage}} are two windows of {{adjustable}} timber louvres, <b>trimmed</b> with <b>moulded</b> architraves and with triangular pediments over.|$|R
50|$|The plain scarf is not {{preferred}} when {{strength is}} required, {{so it is}} often used in decorative situations, such as the application of <b>trim</b> or <b>moulding.</b> The use of modern high-strength adhesives can greatly increase the structural performance of a plain scarf.|$|R
50|$|All {{exterior}} badging (front bumper, grille trim, {{trunk lid}} nomenclature and <b>moulding</b> <b>trim)</b> was finished in 24 karat gold. C-pillar emblems were finished in a gold cloisonné.|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} a {{modified}} version of the TC 108G styled by Graber of Switzerland but built by Mulliner Park Ward and distinguished by having twin headlights mounted one above the other. Saloon and drophead versions were available. The design was noted for its lack of bright side <b>trim</b> or creases <b>moulded</b> into the body parts. The windshield was one-piece, curved, and not too highly sloped.|$|R
50|$|Shuttle: This is {{the next}} level up, is only {{available}} in SWB and LWB, with the full engine range, but {{is limited to the}} standard roof height. The Shuttle seats seven to eleven people. Standard features are <b>moulded</b> <b>trim,</b> a second heater, sun blinds for the passenger compartment, and a sliding window on the left hand side only. Optional extras over the Kombi include carpeting and an 'Appearance Package', which includes colour-coded bumpers, double folding rear three-seater bench seat, and a luggage compartment light.|$|R
50|$|The front {{verandah}} has stop-chamfered timber posts, doubled at {{the central}} and end bays. The cast iron balustrade features the classical motif {{of a woman in}} flowing gowns at the centre of each panel. Below the balustrade is a pressed metal frieze, then a slatted timber valance. To the underside of the verandah has a ripple iron lining <b>trimmed</b> with <b>moulded</b> metal gutters. The hipped bullnose roof to the verandah is of corrugated iron, and framed with stop-chamfered purlins and shaped rafters. The gutter has a decorative metal acroterion remaining on one corner. Above is balustraded parapet of moulded plaster pedestals topped with ball motifs, concrete balusters and face brick surrounds. To each end are ornate metal rainwater heads announcing 1912 as the year of the building's construction. The balustrade returns at each end for only one bay, as the side elevations become much simpler and less ornate.|$|R
60|$|My {{sister had}} a trenchant way of cutting our {{bread and butter}} for us, that never varied. First, {{with her left hand}} she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib,--where it {{sometimes}} got a pin into it, and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and <b>trimming</b> and <b>moulding</b> the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart wipe {{on the edge of the}} plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} built of {{polished}} red ashlar. The roof is slate with corniced end stacks. The front elevation features a central pedimented Doric porch, approached via flyover steps and with spearheaded cast-iron railings adjoining. The house has 12-pane sash windows <b>trimmed</b> in apron-style <b>moulding</b> throughout; {{those on the}} ground floor are topped with consoled cornices. The plasterwork features Greek revival ornament, and there is a Doric frieze in the entrance lobby. The interior features—a square central hall with a circular first floor gallery and a domed glass roof—make this one of Newall’s greatest works.|$|R
60|$|Several skiffs, bateaux, and canoes were hauled {{up on the}} shore, and in {{the cove}} itself lay the little craft from which Jasper {{obtained}} his claim {{to be considered a}} sailor. She was cutter-rigged, might have been of forty tons burthen, was so neatly constructed and painted as to have something of the air of a vessel of war, though entirely without quarters, and rigged and sparred with so scrupulous a regard to proportions and beauty, as well as fitness and judgment, as to give her an appearance that even Mabel at once distinguished to be gallant and <b>trim.</b> Her <b>mould</b> was admirable, for a wright of great skill had sent her drafts from England, at the express request of the officer who had caused her to be constructed; her paint dark, warlike, and neat; and the long coach-whip pennant that she wore at once proclaimed her to be the property of the king. Her name was the Scud.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} built in Federal style, and is two stories with {{chimneys}} in each gable end. The white-painted brick is laid in Flemish bond {{on the west}} and south sides that face Cave and 7th Streets. All windows are two-over-two sashes, and the main entrance is a double leaf door with <b>moulded</b> <b>trim</b> and a transom. An Eastlake porch was later added {{to the front and}} north façades. The porch features elaborate panels with floral designs, brackets with acorn pendants, and turned, spool-shaped posts. Two original mantels remain, one Adamesque and one Federal, while two replacement mantels are Classical Revival and Victorian.|$|R
50|$|The library {{building}} has two parts, a main block constructed of brick in 1922 and a rear extension framed in wood and built in 1991. The main block is laid in running bond above {{a row of}} soldier bricks laid on the concrete foundation, and is topped by a side gable roof. The main facade, facing east, has a central projecting gable-roofed portico supported by modified Doric pilasters and columns. The main wall under the portico, surrounding the entrance, is stuccoed. The wooden door is topped by a semicircular fanlight set in <b>moulded</b> <b>trim.</b> The rear wood-frame addition is more utilitarian, and is clad in vinyl siding.|$|R
50|$|The John C. Coffing House {{is located}} {{on the east side of}} Route 44, south of the village center of Salisbury, on 2.5 acre {{overlooking}} a tributary of Factory Brook just to the south. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, oriented facing south toward the brook. It has a five-bay front facade, a side-gable roof with central chimney, a clapboarded exterior, and a locally quarried limestone foundation. The main entrance is at the center of the facade, sheltered by a projecting gabled vestibule added in the early 20th century. The cornices are <b>trimmed</b> with dentil <b>moulding,</b> and there is a half-round fanlight in the street-facing gable end. A wing extends to the right of the main block, apparently incorporating an older ell.|$|R
25|$|Book-ending the Mappin Wing are the Tent Room—used for {{slightly}} less formal gatherings—and the ballroom—the centre of state life at Rideau Hall. It {{is in the}} latter space that honours and awards ceremonies take place, members of the Cabinet are sworn in, ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials, and large-scale state dinners are held; as such, {{it is the second}} most photographed and televised room in Canada, preceded only by the House of Commons. A double-height space, it is lined with tall, arched windows between rectangular pilasters that are topped with gilt, acanthused capitals. Cable <b>moulding</b> <b>trim</b> surrounds most of the openings and, {{around the perimeter of the}} room, at the intersection of walls and ceiling, is a deep and ornate plaster crown moulding formed by a godroon textured frieze and a heavy dentiled bed-mould between layers of talon and gorge mouldings. Above this is the Victorian, lacunar, clear span vaulted ceiling, from the centre of which hangs a Waterford Crystal chandelier, presented by the British government on Victoria Day in 1951 as a token of gratitude for Canada's role in World War II. Also, in an alcove to the south of the ballroom's main door is a stained glass window that celebrates the excellence of Canadian performing artists and the establishment of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards.|$|R
