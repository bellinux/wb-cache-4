Correlation of Azam showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed highly significant while <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference. Correlations of Pahari showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking; grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity observed highly significant but grain yield with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking observed significant difference. Correlation analysis of Iqbal showed that <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis; <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> anthesis and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking showed highly significant while anthesis to silking interval (ASI) with <b>days</b> <b>to</b> silking and <b>days</b> <b>to</b> maturity with anthesis to silking interval (ASI) observed significant difference.

She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens.

5|$|Despite the Holderness scheme, {{there were}} still {{problems}} near Leven and Weel, and William Jessop spent a month inspecting the area before writing a report in July 1786. His plan advocated separating the water which fell on the uplands {{to the north and}} flowed through the low-lying areas, from the local drainage of those low-lying areas. George Plummer carried out most of the subsequent survey work on Jessop's behalf, although Jessop surveyed the River Hull in 1787, to identify how the outfall could be improved. Jessop visited the works from time to time, making seven visits between 1789 and 1792, while the day <b>to</b> <b>day</b> oversight of the scheme was handled by Plummer as resident engineer.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of glutamine supplementation plans on performance, carcass yield, and cut yield of broilers reared in a high-temperature environment. A fully randomized design was adopted for the experiment, comprising 900 male Hubbard broiler chicks assigned to five treatment groups (0 % glutamine from one <b>to</b> 42 <b>days</b> of age; 0. 5 % glutamine from 1 <b>to</b> 7 <b>days</b> of age, followed by 0 % from 8 to 42 days; 1. 0 % glutamine from 1 <b>to</b> 7 <b>days</b> of age, followed by 0. 5 % from 8 <b>to</b> 14 <b>days</b> and 0 % from 15 to 42 days; 1. 5 % glutamine from 1 <b>to</b> 7 <b>days</b> of age, followed by 1. 0 % from 8 <b>to</b> 14 <b>days,</b> 0. 5 % from 15 <b>to</b> 21 <b>days,</b> and 0 % from 22 to 42 days; 2. 0 % glutamine from 1 <b>to</b> 7 <b>days</b> of age, followed by 1. 5 % from 8 <b>to</b> 14 <b>days,</b> 1. 0 % from 15 <b>to</b> 21 <b>days,</b> and 0 % from 22 <b>to</b> 42 <b>days),</b> consisting of six replicates of 30 animals each.

5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day <b>to</b> <b>day.</b> They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
