25|$|At {{the highest}} level, the design may be {{optimized}} to make {{best use of}} the available resources, given goals, constraints, and expected use/load. The architectural design of a system overwhelmingly affects its performance. For example, {{a system that is}} network latency-bound (where network latency is the main constraint on overall performance) would be optimized to minimize network trips, ideally making a single request (or no requests, as in a push protocol) rather than multiple roundtrips. Choice of design depends on the goals: when designing a compiler, if fast compilation is the key priority, a one-pass compiler is faster than a multi-pass compiler (assuming same work), but if speed of output code is the goal, a slower multi-pass compiler fulfills the goal better, even though it takes longer itself. Choice of platform and programming language occur at this level, and changing them frequently requires a complete rewrite, though a modular system may allow rewrite of only some component – for example, a Python program may rewrite performance-critical sections in C. In a distributed system, choice of architecture (client-server, peer-to-peer, etc.) occurs at <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>level,</b> and may be difficult to change, particularly if all components cannot be replaced in sync (e.g., old clients).|$|E

50|$|Monitoring {{has become}} the most popular method of {{enforcing}} regulations in Nike factories. After studying the results of the audits, this system {{has been found to be}} not as effective as authorities expected. When studying the monitoring process, it is important to look at how the monitoring is done, who takes part in it, and the purpose of the check. The person conducting the visit must go in without a bias towards wanting or not wanting to find any flaws in the factory. Inspectors associated with the company have been found to hide errors and those with non-governmental organizations or other interest groups have exaggerated findings. Greater involvement of higher-level Nike employees such as those working for the corporate system is seen as a possible solution to labor issues. At <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>level,</b> the intricacy of patterns on Nike products has been controlled in order to prevent factory workers from being unable to complete the merchandise.

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>design</b> {{of coastal}} {{protection}} structures like levees and seawalls, two important parameters are <b>the</b> <b>design</b> water <b>level</b> and wave height. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> water <b>level</b> determines <b>the</b> required crest height {{and strength of}} <b>the</b> structure. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> wave height is {{used to determine the}} type of armor necessary to protect the structure from wave attack.

A rigorous analysis would use hydrodynamic and wave models to determine the hourly water levels and wave heights at the toe of the structure, over a period of many years. However, constraints in budget, time, or computational resources often make this type of analysis impractical. An alternative is to develop an event ranking method to identify the most intense annual storm events, then analyze only those storms in detail.

Therefore, the method to compute <b>design</b> water <b>levels</b> is extended with another random variable: the river morphology. The results show that the impact of river morphology on <b>design</b> water <b>levels</b> is limited.
