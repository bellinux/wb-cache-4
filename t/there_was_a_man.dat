500|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the development}} of Super Mario Sunshine with producer Takashi Tezuka and directors Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui, it was mentioned that the game's development began with the idea of gameplay involving a water pump.

Therefore, they tried using a man-type character, but thought this was too odd and that [...] "if <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> next to Mario, {{there is a sense of}} incongruity."

[...] Then Anne Hutchinson faced trial for [...] "traducing" [...] (slandering) the ministers, {{and was sentenced to}} banishment following a church trial the following March. [...] The authorities feared an insurrection, and within a week of her sentencing the constables were sent from door to door throughout the colony's towns to disarm those who signed the Wheelwright petition. [...] Within ten days of being served, these individuals were ordered to deliver [...] "all such guns, pistols, swords, powder, shot, & match as they shall be owners of, or have in their custody, upon paine of ten pound for every default".

[...] He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the [...] "Amateur Night" [...] stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.When big name dancers played The Apollo, {{there was nothing in the}} audience but dancers with their shoes," [...] said Sandman Sims. [...] "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers.

[...] Some speculate that the passion, sincerity, clear explanations evident in Henry George's writing account for the almost religious passion that many believers in George's theories exhibit, and that the promised possibility of creating heaven on Earth filled a spiritual void during an era of secularization. Josiah Wedgwood, the Liberal and later Labour Party politician wrote that ever since reading Henry George's work, [...] "I have known 'that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> from God, and his name was Henry George.'

About corrupting the rich, young men of Athens, Socrates argues that deliberate corruption is an illogical action.
