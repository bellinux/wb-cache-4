5|$|The city's {{industrial}} base {{continued to grow}} in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain {{at the tip of the}} Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.|$|E
500|$|Several {{employees}} of The Simpsons {{were impressed with}} Gaga's performance, who cited that her vocal range and ad-libbing skills were exceptional. Series creator Matt Groening stated: [...] "Since the very beginning, Iâ€™ve always wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most iconic personalities of our time, and she's it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, Groening further commented on Gaga's appearance; [...] "The great thing about having Lady Gaga is that she came {{in a number of}} times and always with a different getup. Like she'd leave the room and come back in after a break in a completely new getup. It was unbelievable. The only time that she ever took off her hat was when it was banging into the microphone." [...] Cast member Yeardley Smith said that she was shocked that Gaga had the time to make an appearance on the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the record is a {{reference}} to the 1994 novel Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses, written by Billy Childish. A copy of the book had been dedicated to Minogue, but was accidentally passed onto Nick Cave, eventually given to Minogue not long after. She recalled only looking at the {{title of the}} book, and saying that [...] "It had me written all over it." [...] Additionally, she believed that the poems in the book summarised where she was at that time in her life. Furthermore, the title was used in the album's song [...] "Dreams", during the chorus, [...] "These are the dreams of an impossible princess". Although copies of the album and its title were printed in mid-1997, on 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a fatal car accident. Due to impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's aforementioned titled was [...] "insensitive" [...] and the label delayed its release. Feeling the title would be inappropriate <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album, Minogue and her management came to a mutual agreement to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe, the same name as her 1994 record. However, upon the album's remastered and re-released edition on 23 March 2003, the album re-instated the Impossible Princess title in those regions.|$|E

500|$|In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie's [...]296 average, [...] "an average {{even now}} that scores of players {{would be glad}} to accept," [...] put him at risk for hitting below [...]300 {{for the first time in}} his career. He also missed 15 games due to a {{recurrence}} of sepsis which he contracted during the 1905 season. Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie's head. [...] "George didn't mean anything by it", Lajoie said, and the two maintained a working relationship. He finished the season with an average of [...]299. Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from the Detroit Tigers for the Naps' Elmer Flick and Tigers' Ty Cobb. Tigers manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the trade because Cobb was not getting along with several teammates. Somers decided to retain Flick, saying, [...] "We'll keep Flick. Maybe he isn't as good a batter as Cobb, but he's much nicer <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team." [...] The Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 9064 record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 9063 and were not forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules). Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps' second-place finish. Author Fred McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig Clarke and Lajoie.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} American comedian Fred Willard as Wally Kogen. Scully stated that, {{for many}} years, the Simpsons staff had wanted Willard to guest-star in an episode, {{and that they}} had been looking for a character for Willard to portray. Scully also stated that Willard was [...] "great fun" [...] <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. Wally Kogen's name is taken from two former writers on The Simpsons; the character's first name, Wally, is taken from Wallace Wolodarsky, and the character's last name, Kogen, is taken from Jay Kogen. The episode also features former football players Rosey Grier, Troy Aikman and Dan Marino as themselves. Scully stated that, when athletes guest-star in television shows, their performances are [...] "not always the greatest", however, he asserted, Aikman, Grier and Marino were all [...] "really funny" [...] and [...] "did a great job". Country singer Dolly Parton guest-starred as herself as well. Scully stated that he was [...] "shocked" [...] by how short Parton was, however he added that she was [...] "very nice" [...] and [...] "thrilled" [...] to be in the episode. Also featured in the episode is Rupert Murdoch, creator of the Fox Broadcasting Company. Originally, the writers wanted Murdoch to be portrayed by Castellaneta, the voice of Homer among other characters in the series. However, after a while, the writers decided to ask if Murdoch would guest-star as himself. Scully comments that the writers were [...] "impressed" [...] that Murdoch would introduce himself as a [...] "billionaire tyrant" [...] in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Eastern Orthodox Christians also object that, {{even if the}} {{teaching}} of the Filioque can be defended, its interpolation into the Creed is anti-canonical. The Roman Catholic Church, which like the Eastern Orthodox Church considers {{the teaching}} of the Ecumenical Councils to be infallible, [...] "acknowledges the conciliar, ecumenical, normative and irrevocable value, as expression of the one common faith of the Church and of all Christians, of the Symbol professed in Greek at Constantinople in 381 by the Second Ecumenical Council. No profession of faith peculiar to a particular liturgical tradition can contradict this expression of the faith taught and professed by the undivided Church", but considers permissible additions that elucidate the teaching without in any way contradicting it, and that do not claim <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of their insertion, the same authority that belongs to the original. It allows liturgical use of the Apostles' Creed as well of the Nicene Creed, and sees no essential difference between the recitation in the liturgy of a creed with orthodox additions and a profession of faith outside the liturgy such that of the Patriarch of Constantinople Saint Tarasius, who developed the Nicene Creed as follows: [...] "the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father through the Son".|$|E
2500|$|At another {{conference on}} 2 October, Haig {{announced}} that operations at Ypres would continue {{for as long}} as the weather permitted, that six fresh divisions were being moved from quiet fronts to the Fifth Army and that the Canadian Corps was being moved to the Second Army. The arrangements to be made for immediate exploitation, should the attack intended for 10 October be as successful as hoped, were that each attacking division was to keep its reserve brigade lightly equipped and accompanied by two [...] batteries, two [...] howitzer batteries and four field artillery brigades. If the infantry brigades conducting the morning attack reported a big success, their reserve brigades would continue the advance in the afternoon. The reserve brigades of the attacking divisions of I and II Anzac corps were to reach Drogenbroodhoek in the south, [...] beyond Broodseinde, Passchendaele station on the Morslede road in the centre and gain touch with the Fifth Army on the Westroosebeke road north of Passchendaele. A reserve division of each corps was to be ready behind the front, which the Director-General of Transportation Major-General Nash, undertook <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield in â€“ if given three hours' notice. The divisions in corps reserve would be ready by the following morning to advance beyond the reserve brigades, if German resistance crumbled. A cavalry division was given to each army, to operate with the reserve divisions, two tank battalions were attached to the Second Army and a tank brigade to the Fifth Army to exploit the firmer going, should the advances take place.|$|E
