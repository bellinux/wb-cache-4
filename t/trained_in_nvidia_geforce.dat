50|$|Two memory {{interfaces}} per module is {{a common}} configuration for PC system memory, but single-channel configurations are common in older, low-end, or low-power devices. Some personal computers and most modern graphics cards use more than two memory interfaces (e.g., four for Intel's LGA 2011 platform and the <b>NVIDIA</b> <b>GeForce</b> GTX 980). High-performance graphics cards running many interfaces in parallel can attain very high total memory bus width (e.g., 384 bits <b>in</b> the <b>NVIDIA</b> <b>GeForce</b> GTX TITAN and 512 bits in the AMD Radeon R9 290X using six and eight 64-bit interfaces respectively).|$|R

50|$|The fifth {{generation}} of PureVideo HD, introduced with the GeForce GT 520 (Fermi (microarchitecture)) and also included <b>in</b> the <b>Nvidia</b> <b>GeForce</b> 600/700 (Kepler (microarchitecture)) series GPUs has significantly improved performance when decoding H.264.It is also capable of decoding 2160p 4K Ultra-High Definition (UHD) resolution videos at 3840 × 2160 pixels (doubling the 1080p Full High Definition standard {{in both the}} vertical and horizontal dimensions) and, depending on the driver and the used codec, higher resolutions of up to 4032 × 4080 pixels.|$|R
50|$|The sixth {{generation}} of PureVideo HD, introduced with the Maxwell (microarchitecture), e.g. in the GeForce GTX 750/GTX 750 Ti (GM107) and also included <b>in</b> the <b>Nvidia</b> <b>GeForce</b> 900 (Maxwell) series GPUs has significantly improved performance when decoding H.264 and MPEG-2.It is also capable of decoding Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI) 4K resolution videos at 4096 × 2160 pixels and, {{depending on the}} driver and the used codec, higher resolutions of up to 4096 × 4096 pixels.GPUs with Feature Set E support an enhanced error concealment mode which provides more robust error handling when decoding corrupted video streams.|$|R
50|$|With {{respect to}} {{discrete}} GPUs, found <b>in</b> add-in graphics-boards, <b>Nvidia's</b> <b>GeForce</b> and AMD's Radeon GPUs {{are the only}} remaining competitors in the high-end market. Along with its nearest competitor, the AMD Radeon, the GeForce architecture is moving toward general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU). GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, {{to turn it into}} a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complex decision-making code).|$|R
5000|$|A speed bump, in {{computer}} terms, {{is a slight}} increase in frequency (e.g., from 1.8 to 1.9 GHz) or a slight increase <b>in</b> functionality (e.g. <b>Nvidia</b> <b>GeForce</b> GTX260 to GTX260 Core 216). Some time after the initial release of a product, manufacturers may choose to increase the clock frequency of an integrated circuit for a variety of reasons, ranging from improved yields to more conservative speed ratings (e.g., actual power consumption lower than TDP). These models are binned as different product chipsets, which places the product into separate virtual bins in which manufacturers can designate them into lower end chipsets with different performance characteristics.|$|R
25|$|Several GPU {{implementations}} of {{the algorithm}} <b>in</b> <b>NVIDIA's</b> CUDA C platform are also available. When {{compared to the}} best known CPU implementation (using SIMD instructions on the x86 architecture), by Farrar, the performance tests of this solution using a single <b>NVidia</b> <b>GeForce</b> 8800 GTX card show {{a slight increase in}} performance for smaller sequences, but a slight decrease in performance for larger ones.

40|$|Abstract — Human face {{detection}} and recognition finds various application in domain like Surveillance, Law Enforcement, Interactive game application etc. These application requires fast image processing {{in real time}} however with the proposed work earlier does not gives that capability. In this paper we have proposed technique that process image for face {{detection and}} recognition <b>in</b> parallel on <b>NVIDIA</b> <b>GeForce</b> GTX 770 GPU which has compute Capability of 3. 0. We have used Viola and Jones for face detection and PCA Eigenfaces algorithm for face recognition. The viola and jones shown result of processing the faces at 15 frame per second but our method shown approximately 109 frame per second in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) development framework. The algorithm are implemented to process data in parallel and made some practical optimization changes to work fast in C based programming model from NVIDIA. We have tested our proposed work on static images, video frame {{as well as on}} live camera frames captured device. We also tested that our system works robustly in extremely illumination condition.
