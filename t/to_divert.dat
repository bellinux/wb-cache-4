5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose {{function is}} <b>to</b> <b>divert</b> {{turbulent boundary layer}} airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface <b>to</b> <b>divert</b> the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times the speed of sound, reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001. Multiple models underwent wind tunnel tests; {{it was found that the}} DSI reduced weight, cost, and complexity while improving performance.|$|E
