25|$|Bennis (2004) {{emphasizes}} <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> {{leaders must}} promise their followers {{that they will}} never be devalued or punished because they express dissent. All too often in the past, organizations would marginalize or terminate any employee who voiced an opposing view. Additionally, leaders should reward dissent and punish conflict avoiders. Anyone who clearly withholds a dissenting view only to obstruct the implementation later should be held responsible.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has also}} found <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> social marketing, {{a form of}} CSR {{promoting}} societal good, {{is being used to}} direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry.

Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in this case to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1975 {{retirement}} of the Cessna 182, Paralift continued to operate parachuting flights. However, it increasingly focused on ad hoc and corporate charter. It targeted a growing market for executive charters using smaller twin-prop aircraft. Although slightly slower, they {{were significantly more}} economical <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> jets. Paralift was able to operate many routes cheaper than scheduled services given that the entire aircraft was filled up. In addition, nonstop flights were available on any conceivable route combination, unlike scheduled services. Paralift was therefore successful at targeting smaller groups of executives traveling as a group.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1990s, the issue of {{corporate}} governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at IBM, Kodak, and Honeywell) by their boards. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) led a wave of institutional shareholder activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently back-dated).|$|E

25|$|Business {{marketing}} campaigns, particularly sales promotions {{for products}} that increase pollution {{or have been}} linked to the development of breast cancer, such as alcohol, high-fat foods, some pesticides, or the parabens and phthalates used by most cosmetic companies, have been condemned as pinkwashing (a portmanteau of pink ribbon and whitewash). Such promotions generally result in a token donation to a breast cancer-related charity by taking advantage of the consumers' fear of cancer and grief for people who have died to drive sales. Critics say that these promotions, which net more than US $30 million each year just for fundraising powerhouse Susan G. Komen for the Cure, do little more than support the marketing machines that produce them. Komen says <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> sponsorships are necessary to pay for the organization's efforts: in the 2010 fiscal year it spent $175 million on public health education and awareness campaigns, $75 million on medical research and about $67 million on treatment and screenings for patients.|$|E

[...] Satin attempted to embrace the promise but also the balance implied by the term. [...] One feature story is entitled [...] "Tough on Terrorism, and Tough on the Causes of Terrorism". [...] Another feature story attempts to go beyond polarized positions on biotechnology. [...] Another argues <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> activity abroad can best be seen as neither inherently moral nor inherently imperialistic, but as a [...] "chance for mutual learning". [...] The board of advisors of Radical Middle Newsletter signaled Satin's new direction. [...] It was politically diverse, {{and many of its}} members sought to promote dialogue or collaboration across ideological divides. [...] By the end of 2004 it included John Avlon, Don Edward Beck, Jerry H. Bentley, Esther Dyson, Mark P.

500|$|The {{process for}} {{awarding}} host city honours came under intense scrutiny after Salt Lake City had been awarded {{the right to}} host the 2002 Games. [...] Soon after the host city had been announced {{it was discovered that}} the organisers had engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme to curry favour with IOC officials. Gifts and other financial considerations were given to those who would evaluate and vote on Salt Lake City's bid. These gifts included medical treatment for relatives, a college scholarship for one member's son and a land deal in Utah. Even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch received two rifles valued at $2,000. Samaranch defended the gift as inconsequential since, as president, he was a non-voting member. [...] The subsequent investigation uncovered inconsistencies in the bids for every Games (both summer and winter) since 1988. For example, the gifts received by IOC members from the Japanese Organising Committee for Nagano's bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics were described by the investigation committee as [...] "astronomical". Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, the IOC feared <b>that</b> <b>corporate</b> sponsors would lose faith in the integrity of the process and that the Olympic brand would be tarnished {{to such an extent that}} advertisers would begin to pull their support. [...] The investigation resulted in the expulsion of 10 IOC members and the sanctioning of another 10. New terms and age limits were established for IOC membership, and 15 former Olympic athletes were added to the committee. Stricter rules for future bids were imposed, with ceilings imposed on the value of gifts IOC members could accept from bid cities.|$|E
