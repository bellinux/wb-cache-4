5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified into a deep depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due {{to the influence of}} dry air from the Arabian Peninsula, as well as from wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
5|$|After the ban was lifted, Clouzot {{reestablished}} {{his reputation}} and popularity in France {{during the late}} 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot's wife Véra {{died of a heart}} attack and Clouzot's career suffered due <b>to</b> <b>depression,</b> illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.|$|E

5|$|By September3, Tropical Depression Kristy {{was without}} {{persistent}} deep convection for about 18hours. However, thunderstorms increased around the center later that day, developing a shallow eye-like feature. The convection persisted {{along the western}} periphery of the circulation, and it is estimated Kristy re-attained tropical storm status about 24hours after it was first downgraded <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status. Around the same time, the cyclone began a steady motion to the southwest. Its re-intensification was short-lived, as continued wind shear weakened the convection and left the center devoid of any thunderstorms. On September4, Kristy weakened to tropical depression status, and though quick dissipation was predicted, officials noted that intermittent convection flares could develop. One such convection flare occurred on September5, which persisted around the center and warranted Kristy being upgraded to tropical storm status. By that time, wind shear had decreased somewhat and the storm had turned westward, and with a track through warm water temperatures, Kristy was forecast to maintain tropical storm status for five days.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kristy in 2006 was a {{relatively}} long-lived tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on August30 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Subsequently, Kristy weakened from cooler waters and increased wind shear from Hurricane John to its northeast. Steering currents weakened, and turning to a southerly drift, it weakened to a tropical depression by September2. The next day it briefly regained tropical storm status, only to again deteriorate <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status. After turning to the west, Kristy encountered marginally favorable conditions and attained tropical storm status for a third time, though unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate on September9. The storm never affected land, although initially {{there was a slight}} threat to Clarion Island. Within the National Hurricane Center area of warning responsibility east of 140°W, Hurricane Kristy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone <b>to</b> <b>depression,</b> nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Correlations {{have been}} {{reported}} between behavioral and cognitive outcomes in adolescence and exposure <b>to</b> maternal <b>depression</b> during the first postpartum year, but the effects of timing of maternal depression during subsequent exposure periods have rarely been controlled for. This study aims to methodically investigate the importance of timing of initial exposure <b>to</b> maternal <b>depression</b> with respect <b>to</b> adolescent mental health outcomes. Methods: This study used data on 937 children from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a nationally-representative longitudinal survey established in 1994 by Statistics Canada. Ordinal logistic regression was used to confirm associations between adolescent emotional disorder (at 12 – 13 years) and initial exposure <b>to</b> maternal <b>depression</b> during 2 -year intervals from birth to adolescence. Following their initial exposure <b>to</b> maternal <b>depression,</b> children were dropped from subsequent cycles.

Results: The results indicated that adolescents who were initially exposed <b>to</b> maternal <b>depression</b> {{between the ages of}} 2 – 3 years and 4 – 5 years had a two-fold increase in odds of emotional disorder.

5|$|The National Hurricane Center remarked the {{potential}} for the system transitioning into a tropical cyclone. An approaching trough caused the storm to stall and weaken the deep convection. On April 23, the cyclone weakened <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status due to strong wind shear. A Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the weakening, and also reported a 1.8°F (1°C) temperature rise in the center, suggesting a warm core and some tropical characteristics. Early on April 24, the subtropical depression turned eastward, maintaining limited convection. At the time, forecasters anticipated the depression would continue east-northeastward and become an extratropical cyclone. By late on April 24, the system was too weak to classify using the Dvorak technique, and the NHC ceased issuing advisories. Within 24hours, the circulation dissipated as the system continued eastward through the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The {{convection}} persisted {{along the}} western periphery of an elongated center, organizing enough for the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue warnings on the depression on October20, designating it Tropical Cyclone 03A. With marginally favorable conditions, the depression intensified slightly, and the IMD upgraded it to a 55km/h (35mph) deep depression on October21, the same peak as the JTWC. That day, the system moved over Socotra as it reached an area of cooler water temperatures. Land interaction and dry air weakened the convection around the system as it approached the Gulf of Aden. The IMD downgraded the cyclone <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status on October22. On the next day, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the IMD downgraded the system further to a remnant low to the northeast of Cape Guardafui, Somalia. The JTWC continued tracking the system as it moved northwestward, and the circulation made landfall near Ash Shihr in southeastern Yemen late on October23, losing its identity shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, {{an increase}} in wind shear caused the eye to disappear, and the convection decreased significantly. On December1, the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status, around which time the center became exposed from the convection. The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear, the presence of dry air, and cooler water temperatures, and by December2, the IMD downgraded Agni <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status, which was its final warning on the system. As it approached the coast of Somalia, it turned westward due to {{the building of a}} ridge over Saudi Arabia. Despite unfavorable conditions, thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation, which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. By late on December3, Agni weakened to below tropical storm status, and the JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km (275mi) south-southeast of Cape Guardafui—the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa. The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December4, by which time the system had little remaining convection. It turned southwestward and later to the south, moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December5 near Ceel Huur over water.|$|E

5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vamei {{weakened}} {{quickly as}} it crossed the extreme southern portion of the Malay Peninsula, and late on December 27 the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the Straits of Malacca. The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm <b>to</b> <b>depression</b> status as the center again approached land. Early on December 28, Vamei moved ashore along northeastern Sumatra, and at 0600UTC the JMA classified the storm as dissipated. However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, {{believed to have been}} caused by the process known as upper-level diffluence. On December 29, what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern Bay of Bengal. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on December 30 the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390km (245mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to being treated as a separate system, it was classified as Tropical Cyclone05B. Vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization, though increased wind shear on December 31 rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed from the deep convection, and Vamei quickly dissipated.|$|E
