5|$|The first {{art in the}} Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes {{goes back}} several millennia. Although this predates the Muisca civilisation, whose onset is {{commonly}} set at 800 AD, nevertheless, some of these styles persevered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages</b> and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust was deliberately kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, players uncover clues about the D'ni, an ancient civilization, and the archeological group {{dedicated}} to learning more about them, the D'ni Restoration Council. Aspects of the D'ni civilization such as social structure, marriage, and how Ages came about are also imparted as players progress <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages.</b> Players may collect Relto pages, which offer cosmetic customization to the player's personal Age—for example, making it rain or adding a waterfall.|$|E

5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have {{had a role in}} culture <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages,</b> serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.|$|E
5|$|Technology plays a very {{important}} role in the strategy of the game. As a civilization progresses <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages,</b> technology becomes more and more expensive, which makes collecting the necessary resources to research them difficult. As a consequence, balancing the workforce of villagers across the various resources can make the difference between victory and defeat.|$|E
5|$|Allegorical {{stories are}} central to the poetic diction of many cultures, and were {{prominent}} in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages.</b> Other notables examples include the Roman de la Rose, a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's Piers Ploughman in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.|$|E

5|$|Buildings play a {{big role}} in gameplay, as they are used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages,</b> and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E
5|$|Development of The Blair Witch Project {{began in}} 1993. While film {{students}} at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez came across {{the idea for the}} film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. After graduation, Myrick and Sánchez, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie, and Michael Monello started the production company Haxan Films, derived from Benjamin Christensen's 1922 Swedish-Danish silent documentary horror film Häxan, whose English-language title is Witchcraft <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shona {{sculpture}} in has survived <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> {{and the modern}} style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds {{feature in the}} 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency {{to the introduction of}} the Euro. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to the woodlands and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors– cookery {{writer and}} TV {{presenter}} Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling– to submit booklets {{related to their}} most famous works for publication. Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages,</b> are ostensibly facsimiles of books found in the Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7million for the fund. The £10.8million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis. In 2002 Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping {{to raise money for}} the National Council for One Parent Families.|$|E
5|$|Rowling has {{expanded}} the Harry Potter universe with several short books produced for various charities. In 2001, she released Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (a purported Hogwarts textbook) and Quidditch <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages</b> (a book Harry reads for fun). Proceeds {{from the sale}} of these two books benefited the charity Comic Relief. In 2007, Rowling composed seven handwritten copies of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel, one of which was auctioned {{to raise money for the}} Children's High Level Group, a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries. The book was published internationally on 4 December 2008. Rowling also wrote an 800-word prequel in 2008 as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller Waterstones. All three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels.|$|E

5|$|Similarly to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages</b> (two {{other books}} {{mentioned}} in the Harry Potter novels that have also been printed) the standard and collector's editions of The Tales of Beedle the Bard feature commentary and footnotes from Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts {{and one of the}} main characters of the series. The standard edition also includes illustrations reproduced from the handwritten edition auctioned in December 2007 and the introduction by the author. The limited collector's edition features ten illustrations by J.K. Rowling not included in the standard edition or the original handcrafted edition, as well as an exclusive reproduction of J.K. Rowling's handwritten introduction, and other miscellaneous objects such as replica gemstones and an emerald ribbon.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Ti'ana {{takes place}} earlier than The Book of Atrus. The {{first part of}} the book focuses on life of Atrus' {{grandfather}} Aitrus with his parents Kahlis and Tasera, Aitrus' meeting with Ti'ana, and the birth of their son Gehn. The book also explains the destruction of the D'ni civilization. Two D'ni, Veovis and A'Gaeris, plot to destroy their civilization, which they believe has been corrupted. Veovis and A'Gaeris create a plague which wipes out many of the D'ni and follows them <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ages.</b> Veovis is murdered by A'Gaeris for refusing to write an Age where the two of them would have been worshipped as gods, and Aitrus sacrifices himself in order to lure A'Gaeris to an unstable Age, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, what Paul deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages.</b> Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E

5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E
