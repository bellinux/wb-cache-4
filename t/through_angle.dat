25|$|The seventh, eighth, {{and ninth}} matches {{of the evening}} {{comprised}} the main event championship unification tournament. The first match was the match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Kurt Angle for Austin's WWF Championship. In the beginning, both men applied holds. Austin then took advantage and pounded Angle. The two had a test of strength and Angle applied the ankle lock. Austin {{kicked out of the}} hold, and applied an armlock, followed by an eye rake. He choked Angle in the ropes and attacked in his biceps. Austin threw Angle into the ringpost three times, injuring the left side of Angle's torso. In the ring, Austin used an armbar takedown on Angle's injured left shoulder. Angle then applied the ankle lock on Austin. Austin reached the ropes and Angle broke the hold. Austin followed by knocking Angle's head on the announce table. Angle then wrapped Austin's leg around the ringpost, and applied the ringpost figure four leglock. Back in the ring, Angle applied the ankle lock but Austin rolled <b>through.</b> <b>Angle</b> hit a belly-to-belly suplex, and three German suplexes. Angle missed a moonsault, and Austin took advantage, hitting a Lou Thesz press, and a spinebuster. Austin then hit five German suplexes, but, while in the ropes, Angle hit a low blow, and an Angle Slam. Angle then tried to hit a Stone Cold Stunner, but Austin reversed it into his Stone Cold Stunner to win the match, and retain his title.|$|E
