40|$|A failed <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator</b> bolt was analyzed. Fractographic {{features}} {{revealed that}} the bolt has fractured by overload at about 30 mm from the bolt head and at the last thread region.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} is to design a {{nonlinear}} feedforward neural network model of a laboratory model AMIRA DR 300 (made by AMIRA, Duisburg, Germany). This device consists of two direct-current engines, whose shafts are connected together by a fixed shaft coupling. An output value of the laboratory model is a rotation speed of this shaft coupling and it can be measured either by a <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator,</b> or an incremental position sensor. The first engine was modeling by neural network. The second one is used to apply as a generator of a faulty measured value...|$|R

40|$|A three-component anemometer, {{developed}} and refined {{during the past}} ten years, measures the three orthogonal wind-speed components directly along the instrument's three axes, X, Y, Z. The basic sensor {{for each of the}} three components is a light-weight helicoid propeller driving a tiny precision <b>tachometer</b> <b>generator,</b> which develops a D. C. voltage linearly proportional to the rate of turning of the propeller and reversing in polarity when the direction of rotation reverses. Each propeller turns at a rate almost linearly proportional to the instantaneous wind speed and the cosine of the angle subtended by the wind with the axis of the propeller. Propeller sensors have a starting speed of about 0. 2 m s − 1; a distance constant of about 1 m; and may be used in winds up to 30 m s − 1.
