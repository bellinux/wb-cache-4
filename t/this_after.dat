5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>after</b> the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E

5|$|Records from 1801 {{show that}} at that time {{agriculture}} was {{the main component of}} Puddletown's economy, though cottage industry and artisan crafts were also an important element: 596 people in the parish were primarily employed in agriculture, with 221 employed in handicrafts, manufacture and trade. Cottage industry, often undertaken by women and children, was used to supplement agricultural income, though there were fewer opportunities for <b>this</b> <b>after</b> the French Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with <b>this.</b> <b>After</b> much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E
5|$|As a landlord, Coke was a {{firm believer}} in the right and moral {{obligation}} of a landowner {{to improve the quality of}} life of those living on his estates. The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the landlord was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while the tenant would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts as a result of his uncle's work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke's uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better, but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of <b>this,</b> <b>after</b> receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.|$|E

5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms <b>this.</b> <b>After</b> looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.|$|E
5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if {{he knows}} what destiny is and then tells him {{that he has a}} special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on <b>this.</b> <b>After</b> Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While watching the news coverage of the discovery of the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did <b>this</b> <b>after</b> Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E

5|$|Commercially, {{it was not}} as {{successful}} as her previous records in Japan. It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and stiff competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to stay inside the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve <b>this</b> <b>after</b> Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, <b>this</b> <b>after</b> the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death. He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death. Constantine {{initially}} presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311AD, however, he was spreading another version. According to <b>this,</b> <b>after</b> Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a eunuch in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted. Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding <b>this</b> <b>after</b> British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year {{when there were no}} tests and it was cited as evidence that the previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Ireland Trophy (a ranking {{event in}} this season), he lost 4–5 to Lee in the quarter-finals, {{and in the}} UK Championship, he lost 3–9 to Alan McManus in the second round.

5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve <b>this.</b> <b>After</b> that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|Industry forecasters {{predicted}} that The Golden Age of Grotesque was on course {{to become the}} band's second number one album on the Billboard 200, following 1998's Mechanical Animals, with estimated first-week sales of around 150,000 copies. The album debuted at number one with first week sales of over 118,000 copies, {{at the time the}} lowest opening week total for a number one-debuting studio album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data in 1991. This figure was just 1,000 copies more than the first week sales of Holy Wood, which debuted at number thirteen in November 2000. Sales of the album dipped to 45,000 copies on its second week, resulting in a positional drop on the Billboard 200 to number 21. This broke the record previously held by Nine Inch Nails' 1999 album The Fragile for the largest drop from number one in the chart's history. The Golden Age of Grotesque held this record until Incubus' Light Grenades dropped to number 37 in December 2006. As of November 2008, the album has sold 526,000 copies in the US, making it the lowest-selling number one-debuting studio album of 2003. This was the second year the band achieved <b>this,</b> <b>after</b> Mechanical Animals became the lowest-selling number one-debuting studio album of 1998. It also entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number one, selling 11,500 copies on its first week.|$|E
5|$|John, the {{youngest}} of five sons of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, was at first not expected to inherit significant lands. Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. John's elder brothers William, Henry and Geoffrey died young; by the time Richard I became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>after</b> Richard died in 1199, John was proclaimed King of England, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.|$|E
