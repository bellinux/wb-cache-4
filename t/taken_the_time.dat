An ornate example was the embroidered train of George IV of the United Kingdom, carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the Swiss Guard and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes are of course the focal point of Halloween parades such as that staged in Greenwich Village, New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply to show off the costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.|$|E
500|$|According to the Opies, Perrault's great {{achievement}} was accepting fairy tales at [...] "their own level." [...] He neither recounted them with impatience nor mockery, and without {{feeling that they}} needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story—although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming moralité. Perrault would be revered today {{as the father of}} folklore if he had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to record where he obtained his tales, when, and under what circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The explicitness of the album's lyrics {{mandated}} a Parental Advisory logo in the United States, {{largely due}} to the lurid nature of the songs as well as their usage of profanity. Derogatory terms such as [...] "bitch", [...] "slut", and [...] "whore" [...] are used prominently in the songs. [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things", said Love in a 1991 interview with Everett True. [...] "I sometimes feel that no one's <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space." [...] In spite of its graphic lyrics, the underlying female themes in many of the songs led some journalists to tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, which Love was not directly associated with.|$|E

500|$|Love's lyrical {{content is}} {{composed}} from a female's point of view, and her lyrics {{have been described}} as [...] "literate and mordant" [...] and noted by scholars for [...] "articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness". According to a 2014 interview, lyrics have remained the most important component of songwriting for Love: [...] "I want it to look just as good on the page as it would if it was in a poetry book". A great deal of her songwriting has been diaristic in nature. Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: [...] "I try to place [...] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things... I sometimes feel that no one's <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space".|$|E

He knew the ship was sailing under a false flag without the proper licenseslicenses which Colnett had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to acquire. In his journal Colnett wrote that the time Barkley saved in not acquiring the licenses allowed him to arrive at Nootka Sound first. As a result, [...] "he engrossed the whole trade & ruined ours". Colnett believed that Barkley was [...] "not Ignorant he had no right here", and sent Barkley a letter requesting to see [...] "his Authority for trading in the Southsea Company's limits", but Barkley evaded the issue. Colnett wrote {{that he would take}} up the matter when he returned to England.|$|E
2500|$|One funeral {{industry}} professional of 40 {{years experience}} lauded {{the goal of}} greater family involvement in funerals, but said it was [...] "virtually impossible" [...] for many families today to return to preparing bodies themselves or hosting wakes in their own homes, citing the challenges of moving a body themselves, or dealing with a body that had been autopsied, or, especially, the innate fear of contact with the dead, {{which he did not}} think would [...] "ever change". Doughty says her 'dream funeral' is one where the family is involved, washing and dressing the body and keeping it at home. When they've <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they need with the dead person, transporting the person to a natural burial cemetery and putting them straight into the ground, no heavy sealed casket or vault.

2500|$|An 25 October 2009, poll {{suggested}} that Ignatieff {{had a lower}} popularity than Dion at his worst showing as Liberal leader. A month later Dion's wife Janine Krieber wrote a scathing letter on her Facebook page in which she {{suggested that}} the Liberal Party was in full collapse and the future appeared bleak. She questioned Ignatieff's ability to lead the party out of its current woes, alleging that party members were duped by Ignatieff and would have recognized his obvious shortcomings if they'd only <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to read his academic writings. Krieber claimed that Dion was working to rebuild the party after the disappointing 2008 election, but their efforts were stymied by Ignatieff, who turned down the coalition with the other opposition parties, and who [...] "dethroned Dion without a leadership race". Dion {{was said to have}} no involvement in the criticism letter and later asked Kreiber to remove the Facebook post, which talks of deep divisions in the Liberal Party.|$|E

2500|$|At {{about the}} same time as Wood, Herbert Storing, who was working on his {{collection}} The Complete Anti-Federalist, came to the same conclusion that the case for Lee's authorship was weak, the only original evidence being the Courant article. Storing, however, argues that the case against Lee's authorship is also weak. Work produced since Wood's paper has been mixed in its attribution of the pamphlets, with some writers not naming an author and others citing the work as Lee's. Authors who have <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> to comment on the debate generally concur with Wood, and no scholar has attempted a substantial refutation of Wood's paper. Walter Bennett, editor of a 1979 edition of the Federal Farmer, disagrees with Wood on many points but concludes that the evidence for Lee is not [...] "sufficient to justify continuing this attribution." [...] The editors of The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution declare Wood's challenge to Lee's authorship to be [...] "effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, the {{conflict}} between the American and National Leagues ended in the National Agreement of 1903. The NAPBL became involved in the later stages of the negotiations to develop rules for the acquisition of players from their leagues by the National and the American. The 1903 agreement ensured that teams would be compensated for the players that they had <b>taken</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and effort to scout and develop, and no NA team was required to sell their players, although most did because the cash was an important source of revenue for most teams. The NA leagues were still fiercely independent, and the term [...] "minor" [...] was seldom used in reference to them, save by the major-market sports writers. News did not travel far in the days before television and radio, so, while the leagues often bristled at the major market writers descriptions, they viewed themselves as independent sports businesses. Many baseball writers of that time regarded the greatest players of the minor leagues, such as Buzz Arlett, Jigger Statz, Ike Boone, Buddy Ryan, Earl Rapp and Frank Shellenback, as comparable to major league players. Leagues in the NA would not be truly called minor until Branch Rickey developed the first modern farm system in the 1930s. The Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis fought Rickey's scheme, but, ultimately, the Great Depression drove teams to establish systems like Rickey's to ensure a steady supply of players, as many NA and independent teams could not afford to keep their doors open without the patronage of major league baseball. The leagues of the NA became subordinate to the major leagues, creating the first minor leagues. Other than the Pacific Coast League, which under its president Pants Rowland tried to become a third major league in the Western states, the other leagues maintained autonomy in name only, being totally economically dependent upon the American and National leagues.|$|E
