5|$|Owens did {{not have}} time to {{complete}} <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct most of the work from home. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into <b>the</b> <b>shot,</b> the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> before being replaced by digital ones. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E

5|$|No player {{along the}} lane may enter the key until <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> is released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim.

If a defending player is in the lane too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> was made or missed.|$|E

The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to duplicate <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or duplicate <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition.

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. <b>The</b> <b>shot</b> weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

5|$|East Orange, New Jersey-born field athlete Dorian Scott {{competed for}} Jamaica in the men's shot put. He was 26 {{years old at}} the time, and had not competed at any Olympic games prior to his {{performance}} in Beijing. During the August 14 qualifying round, Scott was placed in the second heat, which included 23 athletes. He was given three chances to put <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> During his first attempt, <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> flew 19.54meters, placing him 10th; in the second, 19.94meters, placing him sixth; and in the third, 19.71meters. However, since his second score was the best mark he received, the third score went unranked and the second score was used as his final score in the qualifying round. Overall, Scott placed 15th out of the 40 placing athletes, falling behind the Ukraine's Andriy Semenov (20.01meters) but displacing Australia's Justin Anlezark (19.91meters). He did not progress to the final round on August 15.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms.

In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh Wicks parried <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0.

In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> clock. In all cases, the count resets if <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E
