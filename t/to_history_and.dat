5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten <b>to</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> went unseen for years.|$|E
5|$|After {{wintering}} in Weymouth, Gorges {{abandoned his}} new colony {{in the spring}} of 1624 due to financial difficulties. Most of his settlers returned to England, but some remained in as colonists in Weymouth, Plymouth, or Virginia. The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632. In time, the location of the original settlement was lost <b>to</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> development. The location of the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1859, Heliade {{returned}} to Bucharest, {{which had become}} {{the capital of the}} United Principalities after the common election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza and later that of an internationally recognized Principality of Romania.

Until his death, he published influential volumes on a variety of issues, while concentrating on contributions <b>to</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> literary criticism, and editing a new collection of his own poems. In 1863, Domnitor Cuza awarded him an annual pension of 2,000 lei.|$|E

25|$|After his death, Thucydides's History was {{subdivided}} into eight books: its modern title is the History of the Peloponnesian War.

Annals of the Western Shore {{as a whole has}} been described as part of a renaissance in Le Guin's work since the publishing of The Birthday of the World in 2002, in which the underlying plot of the novel was not subsumed by socially relevant themes. A review for the Center for Children's Books praised Le Guin's world building in particular, saying that the alternative universe of the story was [...] "utterly credible", and that Le Guin had covered everything from minute detail <b>to</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> politics. The review also complimented the characters in the book and singled out Memer, saying that the detailed portrayal of her growth was [...] "masterfully understated." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way.

They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I think that for Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E
