25|$|By 1825, Spark's trading {{business}} had greatly expanded, {{and he was}} chartering ships to coastal trade routes. A year later, his {{business had}} grown even more, and he started a shipping agency. Through this agency, Spark sold incoming cargoes, exporting stores to places such as Hobart, colonial produce to Calcutta, and wool consignments (the first {{of what would be}} very many wool consignments) to London, backloading merchandise when it was possible. Additionally, Spark worked as a sort of agent for farmers and country settlers by purchasing their produce and selling them supplies such as livestock and stores, as well as the occasional ploughman or overseer. At <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> Spark owned more than six thousand acres (24km²) of land on the Hunter River and a nine-acre (4 hectare) grant at Woolloomooloo; Spark had developed a passion for land ownership. In 1835, the designer John Verge (who also built Elizabeth Bay House) helped Spark complete his property, now named Tusculum outside of Wolloomooloo Hill (now known as Potts Point). It now houses The Royal Australian Institute of Architects.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby later {{stated that}} he had {{concluded}} that, contrary to the focus of psychoanalysts on the internal fantasy world of the child, the important area to study was how a child was actually treated by his parents in real life {{and in particular the}} interaction between them. He chose the actual removal of children from the home at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time</b> because it was a specific event, the effects of which could be studied, and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child's development and because it was preventable. In addition, views that he had already expressed about the importance of a child's real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by [...] "sheer incredulity" [...] by colleagues before World War II. This led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of the effects on a child of early experiences. Bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of the view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to the advancement of science in this area.|$|E
500|$|A {{major reason}} for GE's {{interest}} in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the SNECMA project was {{the only source of}} development funds for an engine in this class at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time.</b> GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber. The company was faced with a dilemma when the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding {{for the development of a}} 10-ton engine – either to build a [...] "limited" [...] technology 10-ton engine with SNECMA, or a similar engine with [...] "advanced" [...] technology on their own. Concerned that the company would be left with only the [...] "limited" [...] engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt & Whitney and a General Motors division with its [...] "advanced" [...] engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.|$|E

2500|$|Another, perhaps incorrect, {{theory is}} that some fairies were {{originally}} worshiped as minor deities, such as nymphs or tree spirits, but {{with the coming of}} Christianity, they lived on, in a dwindled state of power, in folk belief. In <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> fairies were reputed by the church as being 'evil' beings. Many beings who are described as deities in older tales are described as [...] "fairies" [...] in invented Victorian writings. Victorian inventions of mythology, which accounted for all gods as metaphors for natural events that had come to be taken literally, explained them as metaphors for the night sky and stars. This entire Victorian view has been debunked and refuted and is now considered by scholars an antiquated and incorrect view.|$|E
2500|$|Bo came {{to support}} {{economic}} reform {{after one of}} his trips in the 1980s to Boeing's facilities in the United States. During his visit, Bo discovered that {{there were only two}} airplanes parked at the facility. He asked the Boeing executives whether there would be any planes left if the two that he saw were gone. [...] The company's executives answered that two was the exact number they wanted at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> because their production was based on customer orders and anything more than necessary would be a waste of resources. After this visit to Boeing, Bo became much more critical of the Chinese practice of a planned economy, pointing out that excesses of production were in fact a waste of resources. Even for a planned economy, Bo believed that central planning should be based on market demand instead of on rigid Soviet-style planning undertaken without regard to market forces.|$|E
2500|$|Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao, after {{negotiations}} {{spread over}} a number of years, on May 2, 2015, inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Mayweather dictated the pace early, controlling range with the jab. His deft movement and pivoting made Pacquiao, who landed only 19% of his punches, consistently miss. Mayweather was able to counter Pacquiao with his right hand constantly throughout the fight and won via unanimous decision with the scorecards reading 118–110, 116–112, and 116–112. The vast majority of media outlets (16/18) scored the bout in his favor. In the days following the fight, many casual observers felt the match {{failed to live up to}} expectations. Pacquiao told the media after the match that he was limited in the fight due to an injured right arm. Sports Illustrated reported that Pacquiao fought through a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, which will require surgery. Bob Arum revealed Pacquiao's injury to have been a persistent one dating back to 2008. Additionally Pacquiao's camp never requested a cortisone injection, which is allowed by the US Anti-Doping Agency, but rather a last minute toradol injection, which was declined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Mayweather, who originally had no plans on a rematch with Pacquiao, told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith in a text that he would be open to a rematch after Pacquiao recovers from shoulder surgery, however as of May 9, 2015, Mayweather stated [...] "Did I text Stephen A. Smith and say I will fight him again? Yeah, but I change my mind. At <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> no, because he's a sore loser and he's a coward." [...] On July 6, 2015, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) stripped Mayweather of his welterweight championship on technical grounds.|$|E
