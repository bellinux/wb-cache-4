5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

That's the way they thought about it and that's the way it is, so we're going to live with that. Now, if I'm a Hall of Famer for you, that's all right with me. Just keep loving old Buck. Don't weep for Buck. No, man, be happy, be thankful.|$|E
25|$|We must refuse {{everything}} to the Jews as a nation and accord {{everything to}} Jews as individuals. We must withdraw recognition from their judges; they should only have our judges. We must refuse legal protection {{to the maintenance of}} the so-called laws of their Judaic organization; they {{should not be allowed to}} form in the state either a political body or an order. They must be citizens individually. But, some will say <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them. It is repugnant to have in the state an association of non-citizens, and a nation within the nation...|$|E

500|$|While Davidge professed {{himself as}} {{a huge fan of}} O'Donnell's work, he felt the music needed to change to fit the new trilogy. [...] "The phrase that kept going around was 'evolution not revolution' of the score," [...] he said. [...] " [...] more electronic, {{slightly}} more beat-driven direction, which is one reason why they came <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> wanted to flesh out, sonically, a new universe. One that they could expand on in subsequent sequels.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "Of all my videos, I suppose 'Sunday Morning' is {{the most}} like them. It's the most honest–where they are all hang out together, that feels very real <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> all get on and they're very good friends and have very {{different}} lives. When I met them {{some of them were}} still living with their parents! (Well, some of them.) They hang on {{to each other in the}} sense of that when they got huge across the world, there was already a sense of family between them." ...|$|E
500|$|Deathly Hallows {{begins with}} a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' The Libation Bearers. Of this, Rowling said [...] "I really enjoyed {{choosing}} those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known {{it was going to be}} those two passages since Chamber was published. I always knew [...] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> really do".|$|E

500|$|Rivette {{worked with}} scriptwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent using an {{automatic}} writing approach that involved writing the script day by day; {{the actors and}} filmmakers {{did not know the}} direction of the story in advance of each day's filming. Eurimages provided €420,000 of funding in July 2002, and the film was shot that autumn and winter. Rivette immediately thought of Béart, who starred in La Belle Noiseuse, to play the carnal Marie. Béart has said that [...] "Of all the films I've made, this was the one which most disturbed people very close <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> said: 'It's almost as though the Emmanuelle we know was up there on the screen.'." [...] Béart's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended.|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E
500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E

My principle has always been in these investigations to under-value nothing, but to utilize the small for the illustration of the great, the popular tradition for the elucidation of the written monuments." ...|$|E

2500|$|McTaggart remarked, [...] "If {{somebody}} takes a {{third of}} somebody's book, which is what happened <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>they</b> are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression." [...] Goodwin had previously reached a [...] "private settlement" [...] with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for Time magazine, she said, [...] "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The larger question {{for those of us}} who write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen." [...] In its analysis of the controversy, Slate criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, Barbeau starred as Carol Traynor, the {{daughter}} of Bea Arthur's title character on the comedy series Maude, which ran from 1972 to 1978 (actress Marcia Rodd had originated the role of Carol in a 1972 episode of All in the Family, also titled [...] "Maude", alongside Arthur). [...] In her autobiography, There Are Worse Things I Could Do, Barbeau remarked: [...] "What I didn't know is that when I said [...] I was usually walking {{down a flight of}} stairs and no one was even listening <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> were just watching my breasts precede me." [...] During the last season of Maude, Barbeau did not appear in the majority of the episodes. In a 2009 Entertainment Tonight TV interview, Barbeau mentioned that she had good on- and off-camera chemistry with Arthur; she said that the two stayed close until Arthur's death on April 25, 2009. Barbeau and Arthur reunited on camera during a 2007 taping of The View, reminiscing about their long-running friendship and their years as co-stars on Maude.|$|E
