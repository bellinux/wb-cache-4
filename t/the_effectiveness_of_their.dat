5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great {{emphasis was placed on}} continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

Similarly, the katydids, a group of grasshopper-like insects found worldwide, are nocturnal and use their cryptic coloration to remain unnoticed during the day. They remain perfectly still, often in a position that increases <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> camouflage.|$|E

25|$|In {{alliance}} with the Ottoman Empire, Britain mounted an expedition to expel the French from Egypt. After careful preparations and rehearsals in Turkish anchorages, a British force under Sir Ralph Abercromby made a successful opposed landing at the Battle of Abukir (1801). Abercromby was mortally wounded at the Battle of Alexandria, where the British troops demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> musketry, improved discipline and growing experience.

They developed a serial firing technique {{to create a}} continuous rain of bullets on the enemy. They also developed bigger calibers to increase lethal power. Protective boxes in lacquerware were invented to fit over the firing mechanism so it could still fire while it was raining, as were systems to accurately fire weapons at night by keeping fixed angles thanks to measured strings.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} {{partnership between}} Hawke and his Treasurer, Paul Keating, proved essential to Labor's success in government. The two men proved {{a study in}} contrasts: Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early. Hawke's enthusiasms were cigars, horse racing and all forms of sport; Keating preferred classical architecture, Mahler symphonies and collecting British Regency and French Empire antiques. Hawke was consensus-driven; Keating revelled in aggressive debate. Hawke was a lapsed Protestant; Keating was a practising Catholic. These differences, however, seemed only to increase <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> partnership, as they oversaw sweeping economic and social changes throughout Australia.|$|E

25|$|Typically, predators {{attempt to}} reduce {{communication}} to prey as this will generally reduce <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. deception by the predator. A well-known example is the angler fish, an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves {{in a better position}} for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne). These spiders are commonly referred to as “antmimicking spiders” {{because of the way they}} wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{instances}} of larger lionfish individuals engaging in cannibalism on smaller individuals, adult lionfish have few identified natural predators, likely from <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> venomous spines. Moray eels (family Muraenidae), bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), and large groupers, like the tiger grouper (Mycteroperca tigris) and Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), {{have been observed}} preying on lionfish. It remains unknown, however, how commonly these predators prey on lionfish. Sharks are also believed {{to be capable of}} preying on lionfish with no ill effects from their spines. Park officials of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras have attempted to train sharks to feed on lionfish as of 2011 in an attempt to control the invasive populations in the Caribbean. Predators of larvae and juvenile lionfish remain unknown, but may prove to be the primary limiting factor of lionfish populations in their native range.|$|E
