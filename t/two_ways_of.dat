5|$|Philip saw <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> shaking Rhodes' {{dominance}} of the sea: piracy and war. Deciding to use both methods, he encouraged his allies to begin pirate attacks against Rhodian ships. Having already a foothold in Crete since the Cretan Civil War, Philip convinced the Cretans, who {{had been involved in}} piracy for a long time. He also persuaded the Aetolians, and the Spartans {{to take part in the}} piracy. The lure for these nations was the promise of vast loot from captured Rhodian vessels. He sent the Aetolian freebooter Dicaearchus on a large razzia through the Aegean, during the course of which he plundered the Cyclades and Rhodian territories. Additionally, Philip sought to weaken the Rhodians' naval capacity through subterfuge. He achieved this by sending his agent Heracleides to Rhodes where he succeeded in burning 13 boat-sheds.|$|E

The first way is based on analytical formulas, which were derived without taking into account shading {{some parts of the}} sail by its other parts. The second way uses a detail geometric model of the sail which allows taking proper account of such shading. We assume photons interact with the sail in <b>two</b> <b>ways.</b> Some <b>of</b> them have a specular reflection, the others are absorbed. We ascertain the range of spacecraft attitudes with respect to solar rays in which the analytical formulas are sufficiently exact. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R
25|$|Construction of the {{reflective}} 5-dimensional uniform polytopes are done through a Wythoff construction process, and represented through a Coxeter diagram, where each node represents a mirror. Nodes are ringed to imply which mirrors are active. The {{full set of}} uniform polytopes generated {{are based on the}} unique permutations of ringed nodes. Uniform 5-polytopes are named in relation to the regular polytopes in each family. Some families have two regular constructors and thus may have <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> naming them.|$|E

Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have <b>two</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> arriving at the same name.|$|E
