5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum <b>trailer</b> <b>capacity</b> of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{expansion}} of the sugarcane industry in Brazil has intensified the mechanization of agriculture and caused effects on the soil physical quality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the limiting water range and soil bearing capacity of a Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico típico (Rhodic Hapludox) under the influence of different tractor-trailers used in mechanical sugarcane harvesting. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with five replications. The treatments consisted of green sugarcane harvesting with: harvester without trailer (T 1); harvester with two <b>trailers</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of 10 Mg each (T 2); harvester with <b>trailer</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of 20 Mg (T 3) and harvester and truck with <b>trailer</b> with a <b>capacity</b> of 20 Mg (10 Mg per compartment) (T 4). The least limiting water range and soil bearing capacity were evaluated. The transport equipment to remove the harvested sugarcane from the field (trailer) at harvest decreased the least limiting water range, reducing the structural soil quality. The truck trailer caused the greatest impact on the soil physical properties studied. The soil load bearing capacity was unaffected by the treatments, since the pressure of the harvester (T 1) exceeded the pre-consolidation pressure of the soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the association between space allowance and in-transit loss of finishing pigs going to select abattoirs in Ontario during summer weather conditions. The study included data from 2 - or 3 -tiered trailers transporting ≥ 130 pigs in June, July, and August 2003 to 3 packers that processed 76 % of Ontario market pigs. Daily in-transit loss data were merged with packer data to determine the number of pigs on each trailer. Space allowance (in square meters per pig) was estimated from the percentage of each <b>trailer’s</b> <b>capacity</b> that was filled by the load size. Actual pig weights were not available. Hourly temperature and relative humidity were obtained from 2 local Ontario weather stations. In-transit loss increased with environmental temperature, by 6. 6 times at temperatures between 28 °C and 34. 2 °C compared with < 17 °C. At space allowances between 0. 44 and 0. 43 m 2 /pig compared with ≥ 0. 515 m 2 /pig, in-transit losses increased 2. 12 times when environmental temperatures were < 21 °C. Temperature is likely a more important determinant of in-transit loss than space allowance. However, in-transit losses in hot weather are likely to be reduced by increasing space allowance or by adding a cooling device...|$|R

An American {{commercial car}} carrier typically fits between 5 and 9 cars, depending on the car size and <b>trailer</b> model (<b>capacity</b> is limited by an 80,000 lb weight cap that a road vehicle is subject to under U.S. law.).

40|$|The current forage {{handling}} {{equipment in the}} cellulosic ethanol industry is severely limited by the low bulk density of baled and ground biomass. Low bulk density contributes to flowability problems and lack of maximizing <b>trailer</b> <b>capacities.</b> Biomass pelleting process can improve the bulk density and flowability characteristics of forages. The objectives of this research were to evaluate: (1) the energy requirements of grinding sorghum stalks, corn stover, wheat straw, and big bluestem through two different screen size openings, (2) the energy requirements of pelleting forages from the two grind sizes, (3) the physical properties of pelleted biomass, and (4) {{the costs associated with}} biomass processing, transportation, and storage. The two mill screen size openings (3. 2 and 6. 5 mm) were found to have significantly different energy consumptions for grinding step from each other. All four forage types, except for big bluestem and corn stover, were also found to have significantly different energy consumptions for grinding. Production rate through the 6. 5 mm screen was almost three times higher than that of the 3. 2 mm screen (average of 181. 4 vs. 68 kg/h). Hammermill screen size opening (i. e., grind size) was found to have significant effects on energy consumption for pelleting process. The four forage types were also found to have significantly different energy consumptions from each other, except for big bluestem versus wheat straw (P= 0. 1192). Particle length for the 3. 2 mm grind ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 18 cm, while the 6. 5 -mm grind ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 31 cm. Pelleting increased bulk density from 99. 96 to 160. 02 kg/m³ for raw biomass grinds to 499. 30 to 701. 13 kg/m³ for pelleted biomass. Pellet durability ranged from 93 % to 98 %. A cost analysis indicated that it would take roughly $ 22 extra per metric ton for the transportation, pre-processing, and storage of pelleted cellulosic biomass than corn grain. This cost is still almost half that of the cost for baled biomass...|$|R

No other comparisons were significant for 3 / 8 ” vs. 3 / 8 ” (All 3 / 8 ” sorghum P<. 0001). Production rate through the 3 / 8 ” screen was almost 3 times that of the 1 / 8 ” screen (Average of 400 lb/hr vs. 150 lb/hr).

Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors.

40|$|The {{transport}} of sugarcane {{from the field}} to the mill represents a substantial proportion {{of the costs of}} cane production. With the introduction of chopper harvesters in Mauritius, a major change has been observed in the transport systems used to haul cane. Presently, cane received from chopper harvesters is hauled directly to the mill by infield {{transport of}} relatively small capacity, or is transloaded into truck-drawn or tractor-drawn <b>trailers</b> of larger <b>capacity.</b> Choice of transport system on various estates was originally based mainly on information obtained from other sugar producing countries, without an economic feasibility study being carried out. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the shortest distance below which direct delivery is more economical than transloading, and subsequently to identify which mode of trans loading is more cost effective. Field surveys were conducted to monitor the cycle times associated with the harvesting and transport operations. After optimisation, these parameters were fed into a computer simulation model to generate the number of transport units required to haul the mechanically harvested cane, when the harvester idle time is either zero or 10 % of a normal ten-hour working day. A cost analysis was used to establish a boundary, defined in kilometres, either side of which represents the economic feasibility of the respective methods. The results obtained using these parameters indicated that direct delivery of green chopped cane has a cost advantage over transloading into outfield transport for distances up to 8 - 9 kilometres...|$|R
