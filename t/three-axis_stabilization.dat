50|$|An {{acquisition}} Sun sensor, {{a cruise}} Sun sensor, a Canopus star tracker and an {{inertial reference unit}} consisting of six gyroscopes allowed <b>three-axis</b> <b>stabilization.</b> Two accelerometers were also on board. Communications were accomplished through a 20 W S-band (2.3 GHz) transmitter and two 20 W TWTAs. An X band (8.4 GHz) downlink was also added specifically for radio science and to conduct communications experiments. Uplink was via S band (2.1 GHz).

50|$|Another {{method for}} {{achieving}} <b>three-axis</b> <b>stabilization</b> {{is to use}} electrically powered reaction wheels, also called momentum wheels, which are mounted on three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They provide a means to trade angular momentum {{back and forth between}} spacecraft and wheels. To rotate the vehicle on a given axis, the reaction wheel on that axis is accelerated in the opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, the wheel is slowed. Excess momentum that builds up in the system due to external torques from, for example, solar photon pressure or gravity gradients, must be occasionally removed from the system by applying controlled torque to the spacecraft to allowing the wheels to return to a desired speed under computer control. This is done during maneuvers called momentum desaturation or momentum unload maneuvers. Most spacecraft use a system of thrusters to apply the torque for desaturation maneuvers. A different approach was used by the Hubble Space Telescope, which had sensitive optics that could be contaminated by thruster exhaust, and instead used magnetic torquers for desaturation maneuvers.|$|E

40|$|A three-axis Magnetometer/Kalman Filter {{attitude}} determination {{system for}} a spacecraft in low-altitude Earth orbit is developed, analyzed, and simulation tested. The motivation for developing this system is to achieve light weight and low cost for an attitude determination system. The extended Kalman filter estimates the attitude, attitude rates, and constant disturbance torques. Accuracy near that of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field model is achieved. Covariance computation and simulation testing demonstrate the filter's accuracy. One test case, a gravity-gradient stabilized spacecraft with a pitch momentum wheel and a magnetically-anchored damper, is a real satellite on which this attitude determination system will be used. The application to a nadir pointing satellite and the estimation of disturbance torques represent the significant extensions contributed by this paper. Beyond its usefulness purely for attitude determination, this system {{could be used as}} part of a low-cost <b>three-axis</b> attitude <b>stabilization</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Attitude {{control for}} small {{satellites}} differ from traditional attitude control systems by having simple hardware and inexpensive actuators imposed by cost constraints.

50|$|ATS-6 {{has been}} the first {{geostationary}} satellite with <b>three-axis</b> <b>stabilization</b> and pointing., This subsystem was capable of a highly accurate pointing (better than 0.1° through the inertial measurement units, down to 0.002° by using a radio-frequency interferometer.). Furthermore, the satellite was able to follow low earth orbit satellites through slewing, by tracking the low earth-orbit satellite through an S-band RF sensing. The system was also able to perform orbitography of the tracked satellite, and was a precursor to the operational system TDRSS.This highly advanced (for the time) pointing subsystem used earth and sun sensors, a star tracker pointed to the pole star, Polaris, and three inertial sensors. The sensor measurements were fed to two digital computers (nominal and redundant), as well to a back-up analog computer. It was also possible to orient the satellite by using radio-frequency sensors. Actuators were three momentum wheels, and hot gas (hydrazine mono-propellant) thrusters. One of the momentum wheels having failed in July 1975, an alternative scheme was developed, allowing station-keeping with the two remaining wheels and thrusters.|$|E
50|$|There are {{advantages}} and disadvantages to both spin stabilization and <b>three-axis</b> <b>stabilization.</b> Spin-stabilized craft provide a continuous sweeping motion that is desirable for fields and particles instruments, {{as well as some}} optical scanning instruments, but they may require complicated systems to de-spin antennas or optical instruments that must be pointed at targets for science observations or communications with Earth. Three-axis controlled craft can point optical instruments and antennas without having to de-spin them, but they may have to carry out special rotating maneuvers to best utilize their fields and particle instruments. If thrusters are used for routine stabilization, optical observations such as imaging must be designed knowing that the spacecraft is always slowly rocking back and forth, and not always exactly predictably. Reaction wheels provide a much steadier spacecraft from which to make observations, but they add mass to the spacecraft, they have a limited mechanical lifetime, and they require frequent momentum desaturation maneuvers, which can perturb navigation solutions because of accelerations imparted by the use of thrusters.|$|E

40|$|The NPSAT 1 {{satellite}} uses {{an active}} magnetic torque rod system, with a magnetometer for attitude determination, to maintain 3 -axis stabilization, {{with a slightly}} gravity gradient friendly structure. This thesis will examine the performance of three combinations of programs and simulation models for the NPSAT 1 satellite attitude control system. The models include a magnetic control law with a reduced order estimator to generate torque commands to achieve spacecraft nadir pointing and a magnetic rate (Bdot) control law to reduce spacecraft angular rates. The performances of two Bdot mode switching designs are compared. Also, a case is made for the benefits of priming the systemÎ±s reduced estimator prior to mode switching. All of the control methods analyzed appear to be valid control methods to achieve <b>three-axis</b> attitude <b>stabilization</b> using only magnetic torquers for active control.

The MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of STars) {{astronomy}} {{mission has}} been {{chosen by the}} Canadian Space Agency’s Small Payloads Program to be Canada’s first space science microsatellite, and is currently planned for launch in late 2001. The MOST science team will use the MOST satellite to conduct long-duration stellar photometry observations in space. A major science goal is to set a lower limit on the age of several nearby “metal-poor sub-dwarf” stars, which may in turn allow a lower limit to be set on {{the age of the}} Universe. To make these measurements, MOST will incorporate a small (15 cm aperture), high-photometric-precision optical telescope to be developed by UBC. The MOST bus and ground stations are being developed by Dynacon and the University of Toronto, in collaboration with AMSAT Canada. Several of the bus subsystems are based on similar designs that have been flown on past AMSAT microsatellites.
