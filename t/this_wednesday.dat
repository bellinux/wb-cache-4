500|$|The song {{received}} general acclaim from critics. Manny Faces from BirthPlace {{cited the}} song as an improvement from her previous material, writing [...] "It’s a little harder, {{a little less}} sloppy {{and a little more}} promising than some of her previous efforts, many of which have drowned in sonic experimentation that, in some opinions (mine), haven’t done her any favors". A writer for PAPER hailed the track as [...] " [...] first 2013 party jam", adding that the song [...] "will jolt you awake <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday</b> morning more quickly than that venti coffee you've been nursing since 9 am". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen gave [...] "BBD" [...] three-and-a-half stars out of five, describing the song as [...] "a typically fleet, flashy collection of disses and boasts that glory in estrogen power, Sapphic delights, and the fun of cuckolding stupid dudes". Spin writer Marc Hogan thought that the track reflected well on Banks' sense of style, writing [...] "With the squiggly high-end and wobbly sub-bass of what we’re really calling trap-rave now, huh, plus some masterfully timed quiet-loud dynamic shifts, the track displays the virtuosically foul-mouthed rapper’s usual immaculately stylish beat selection".|$|E

[...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also compared the episode to the Lost season finale, writing: [...] "'Desperate Housewives' is willing to answer some of its mysterious questions and give readers a little bit of closure. 'Lost,' heading into its own two-hour finale <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> is still dangling a dozen carrots in front of impatient viewers." [...] Cooper felt that the episode was a satisfying conclusion to the season opining that [...] "by allowing some of its plots to remain tantalizing mysteries, yet offering up the satisfaction of explaining others, 'Desperate Housewives' has smartly set things up for its audience to return for its new season next fall." [...] Frazier Moore of USA Today called the finale [...] "a smashing close" [...] to the first season. Moore expressed interest in how the cliffhangers would be resolved, {{as well as in the}} Betty Applewhite character. He also theorized that Rex's death was a ruse, writing: [...] "Reminder: The audience saw no death scene and no body.

On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres <b>THIS</b> <b>Wednesday</b> on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E

Of Sardinia rising to invade the South-East, and Spain threatening the South, we do not speak. But are not the Prussians masters of Longwi (treacherously yielded, one would say); and preparing to besiege Verdun? Clairfait and his Austrians are encompassing Thionville; darkening the North.

[...] "Mourir! Die!" [...] answer prompt voices; (Hist. Parl. xvii. 148.) and the dusty fugitives must shrink elsewhither for comfort.--Yes, Mourir, that is now the word.

60|$|He {{reflected}} that his life, which until lately had been of a stagnant, contemplative quality, had suddenly become excessively active. In {{the course of}} one week he had been lawyer, mob-orator, outlaw, property-man, and finally buffoon. Last Wednesday he had been engaged in moving an audience of Rennes to anger; on <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday</b> he was to move an audience of Guichen to mirth. Then he had been concerned to draw tears; to-day it was his business to provoke laughter. There was a difference, and yet there was a parallel. Then as now he had been a comedian; and the part that he had played then was, when you came to think of it, akin to the part he was to play this evening. For what had he been at Rennes but a sort of Scaramouche--the little skirmisher, the astute intriguer, spattering the seed of trouble with a sly hand? The only difference lay in the fact that to-day he went forth under the name that properly described his type, whereas last week he had been disguised as a respectable young provincial attorney.|$|E

Reginald, as he walked home from Bragton all alone on that occasion when Larry had returned with Mary, was quite sure {{that he would never}} willingly go into Mary's presence again. Why should he disturb his mind about such a girl,--one who could rush into the arms of such a man as Larry Twentyman? Or, indeed, why disturb his mind about any girl? That was not the manner of life which he planned for himself. After that he shut himself up for a few days and was not much seen by any of the Dillsborough folk. But on <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday</b> he received a letter, and,--as he told himself, merely in consequence of that letter,--he called at the attorney's house and asked for Miss Masters.|$|E

Judge whether <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday</b> was of halcyon nature, for any one! But, on the Thursday morning, we discern Dumouriez with small escort, with Chartres Egalite and a few staff-officers, ambling along the Conde Highway: perhaps they are for Conde, and trying to persuade the Garrison there; at all events, they are {{for an interview with}} Cobourg, who waits in the woods by appointment, in that quarter. Nigh the Village of Doumet, three National Battalions, a set of men always full of Jacobinism, sweep past us; marching rather swiftly,--seemingly in mistake, by a way we had not ordered. The General dismounts, steps into a cottage, a little from the wayside; will give them right order in writing. Hark! what strange growling is heard: what barkings are heard, loud yells of [...] "Traitors," [...] of [...] "Arrest:" [...] the National Battalions have wheeled round, are emitting shot! Mount, Dumouriez, and spring for life! Dumouriez and Staff strike the spurs in, deep; vault over ditches, into the fields, which prove to be morasses; sprawl and plunge for life; bewhistled with curses and lead. Sunk to the middle, with or without horses, several servants killed, they escape out of shot-range, to General Mack the Austrian's quarters. Nay they return on the morrow, to Saint-Amand and faithful foreign Berchigny; but what boots it? The Artillery has all revolted, is jingling off to Valenciennes: all have revolted, are revolting; except only foreign Berchigny, to the extent of some poor fifteen hundred, none will follow Dumouriez against France and Indivisible Republic: Dumouriez's occupation's gone.

6000|$|But on <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday</b> the flavour of {{the dish}} was gone. To be alone amongst his acres, quite alone--to {{have no one to}} care whether he did {{anything}} at all, no one to whom he might confide that Beldame's hock was to be fired, that Peacock was asking for more gates, was almost more than he could bear. He would have wired to the girls to come home, but he could not bring himself to face their questions. Gerald was at Gib! George--George was no son of his!--and his pride forbade him to write to her who had left him thus to solitude and shame. For deep down below his stubborn anger it was shame that the Squire felt--shame that he should have to shun his neighbours, lest they should ask him questions which, for his own good name and his own pride, he must answer with a lie; shame that he should not be master in his own house--still more, shame that anyone should see that he was not. To be sure, he did not know that he felt shame, being unused to introspection, having always kept it at arm's length. For he always meditated concretely, as, for instance, when he looked up and did not see his wife at breakfast, but saw Bester making coffee, he thought, 'That fellow knows all about it, I shouldn't wonder!' and he felt angry for thinking that. When he saw Mr. Barter coming down the drive he thought, 'Confound it! I can't meet him,' and slipped out, and felt angry that he had thus avoided him. When in the Scotch garden he came on Jackman syringing the rose-trees, he said to him, [...] "Your mistress has gone to London," [...] and abruptly turned away, angry that he had been obliged by a mysterious impulse to tell him that: ...|$|E

When he woke the next morning, or rather late in the next day, after his night's work, {{he was no longer}} able to tell himself that the world was all right with him. Who does not know that sudden thoughtfulness at waking, that first matutinal retrospection, and prospection, into things as they have been and are to be; and the lowness of heart, the blankness of hope which follows the first remembrance of some folly lately done, some word ill-spoken, some money misspent,--or perhaps a cigar too much, or a glass of brandy and soda-water which he should have left untasted? And when things have gone well, how the waker comforts himself among the bedclothes as he claims for himself to be whole all over, teres atque rotundus,--so to have managed his little affairs that he has to fear no harm, and to blush {{inwardly}} at no error! Mr Broune, the way of whose life took him among many perils, who {{in the course of his}} work had to steer his bark among many rocks, was in the habit of thus auditing his daily account as he shook off sleep about noon,--for such was his lot, that he seldom was in bed before four or five in the morning. On <b>this</b> <b>Wednesday</b> he found that he could not balance his sheet comfortably. He had taken a very great step and he feared that he had not taken it with wisdom. As he drank the cup of tea with which his servant supplied him while he was yet in bed, he could not say of himself, teres atque rotundus, as he was wont to do when things were well with him. Everything was to be changed. As he lit a cigarette he bethought himself that Lady Carbury would not like him to smoke in her bedroom. Then he remembered other things. 'I'll be d---- if he shall live in my house,' he said to himself.|$|E
