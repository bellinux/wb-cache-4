5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} {{works very}} well in conjunction with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Lost Light, {{attempting}} {{to track down}} Jhiaxus, is pulled off-course by a summons from the badly-wounded Metroplex, via a severed portion of his thumb the ship had previously encountered. Finding the ancient Autobot, and his companions Windblade, Chromia and Nautica on the ocean planet Hydrophena, the crew defends him and themselves against an army of Shockwave's Ammonite minions and use their ship's engines to give him enough of a power boost to teleport them all back home to Cybertron. They return as the Necrotitan {{is in the middle}} of razing Iacon at Shockwave's command; Megatron, having fallen in with Bumblebee, uses his space bridge to teleport Metroplex's thumb — revealed to contain another of Shockwave's ores — from the Lost Light back into its owner's hand, giving him <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> defeat the Necrotitan and heal the plague.|$|E
5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E

5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. Quantum mechanics requires <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> be large as Paul Dirac claimed it is, like a sea of energy. Other scientists specializing in General Relativity require <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> be small enough for curvature of space to agree with observed astronomy. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> be as large as needed to promote quantum actions {{for a brief moment}} of time, even if the average energy is small enough to satisfy relativity and flat space. To cope with disagreements, the vacuum energy is described as a virtual energy potential of positive and negative energy.|$|E

25|$|Tiny buds on {{the vine}} start to swell and {{eventually}} shoots begin to grow from the buds. Buds are the {{small part of the}} vine that rest between the vine's stem and the petiole (leaf stem). Inside the buds contain usually three primordial shoots. These buds appear in the summer of previous growth cycle green and covered in scales. During winter dormancy they turn brown until the spring when the vine begins the process of bud break and the first sign of green in the vineyard emerges in the form of tiny shoots. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> facilitate this growth comes from reserves of carbohydrate stored in roots and wood of the vine from the last growth cycle. Eventually the shoots sprout tiny leaves that can begin the process of photosynthesis, producing <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> accelerate growth. In warm climates, after about 4 weeks the growth of the shoots starts to rapidly accelerate with the shoots growing in length an average of 3cm (1in) a day.|$|E
