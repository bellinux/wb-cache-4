500|$|In 2007, N. ceranae was {{reported}} in a few hives in California. [...] The researcher did not, however, believe this was conclusive evidence of a link to CCD; [...] "We don't want to give anybody the impression that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been solved". A USDA bee scientist has similarly stated, [...] "while the parasite Nosema ceranae may be a factor, it cannot be the sole cause. The fungus has been seen before, sometimes in colonies that were healthy".|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Obama {{undertook}} {{her first}} {{lead role in}} an administration-wide initiative, which she named [...] "Let's Move!," [...] to make progress in reversing the 21st century trend of childhood obesity. On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan towards change. Michelle Obama stated that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: [...] "I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> changed.' And {{my hope is that}} that's {{going to be in the}} area of childhood obesity." [...] Her 2012 book [...] is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating. Her call for action on healthy eating has been echoed by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of recruit obesity.|$|E
2500|$|Knight and Day {{had been}} set for a June 25, 2010, release date, but FOX moved its debut up two days to June 23; {{in the face of}} poor initial {{tracking}} numbers. The New York Observer analyzed the marketing for the film, which included an attempt at pushing a [...] "viral video" [...] of the two main stars; journalist Christopher Rosen commented on the desperation level of the publicity campaign, [...] "the marketing for <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> seemed more intrusive and desperate than any other big-ticket release in some time." [...] Film producer Don Carmody commented negatively regarding the film's trailer, calling it [...] "dull", and stated the film would not do well because of the age of its two stars, [...] "Cameron Diaz I think was a star, but sheâ€™s no longer a star. Some of those stars are getting a little up there (in age)." [...] The Hollywood Reporter noted, [...] "potential viewers remain startlingly indifferent to whether they actually end up seeing it. And attention thus far is still drawn mostly by those under 25, which indicates that the fans who grew up with star Tom Cruise have moved on." ...|$|E
50|$|As though <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> {{made her}} mad.|$|R
60|$|Steve felt stunned. It {{was unthinkable}} that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> really occurred.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where?" [...] echoed Marius. [...] "What affair {{may that}} be of yours? We {{ask you to}} name a price on which you will do <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>Have</b> done with counter-questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We couldn't be extradited," [...] Littleson answered, [...] "and I shall take remarkably {{good care}} not to cross the ocean again until <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> blown over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Stephen," [...] she pleaded, [...] "I am sorry--to {{be such a}} fool--but <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> {{lived with}} me a long time, and--would you go away? It would be kindest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Morally impossible," [...] said I. [...] "The {{point is}} that they can have no guns. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been gone about too secret; pistols they may have, but never guns." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> K---- conceived, and the {{faithful}} workman executed, with the lightest touches of the graver, {{to the end}} that it might lie in a collector's cabinet in London.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot help feeling," [...] {{explained}} Peter, [...] "a {{sense of}} duty in this matter. The child came to me. It is as if <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> been laid upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Had she altered? Her {{mind was}} in a whirl. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> {{affected}} her like some physical shock. The crowds and noises of the street bewildered her. If only she could get away from them and think quietly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, certainly,' he replied, jerking {{his hand}} towards the cab. 'But we mustn't start right here. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> {{got to be}} kept dark, don't you see, till the last day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Believe me, gentlemen, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been {{carefully}} worked out, and no improvement {{is likely to}} result from individual effort. Let our idea be uniformity. It is monotonous, but it is safe. Now, then, gentlemen, once again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to say}} {{anything}} for some while yet, but <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> forced my hand," [...] he said. [...] "You see, I must let them know during {{the next day or}} two whether I'm going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I think {{everything}} was given up. If <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> been of value I should, perhaps, {{have told the}} sheik; but as it was only written papers, and of no use to anyone, I did not trouble to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Locker put {{his hands}} in his pockets. [...] "Do you know," [...] said he, [...] "as <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> to be done, I prefer to have you do it than to have her do it. Well, it is done now! And so am I!" ...|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>thing</b> must <b>have</b> had divine sanction, as {{punishment}} for the people's sins.|$|R
6000|$|The {{old lady}} {{began to cry}} softly. [...] "It's a {{judgment}} on me," [...] she says. [...] "I used to talk to that dog {{as if it had}} been a Christian, and now <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> happened as a punishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> to {{be linked}} to some {{political}} party," [...] said Crupp, with his eye on me. [...] "You can't get away from that. The Liberals," [...] he added, [...] "have never done anything for research or literature." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. That {{just shows}} the {{condition}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> reduced me to. Forget my own name next. Well, then, let's {{just try to}} envisage. Bong goes the bell. Gussie rushes and grabs the Bassett.... Wait. Why shouldn't she simply walk downstairs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And high charges," [...] quoth Richie Moniplies. [...] "But, as I said before, gentlemen, ye have a {{right to}} command me in <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>having</b> so frankly {{rendered}} me your service in this small matter of business, without other stipulation than that of a slight banquet." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> happened. [...] "They put," [...] said my uncle, [...] "a little chap at the piano, and me at a {{very nice}} girl indeed as she looked; and the little chap began, and so did I. I said a prelude thing of mine, brand new and rather pretty." ...|$|R
60|$|Came the {{metallic}} bang of the carbines again, {{and in the}} instant the leader collapsed in the road, a sprawl of clothes, hit by half a dozen bullets. It was an extraordinary effect. As though the figure had been deflated. It was incredible that a moment before <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> been a man, an individual, a hesitating complicated purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "we {{need all}} the man power we can command. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> come to a {{showdown}} and we've got to recognise it. I told Henry that it's a showdown and that he's to get ready and start right away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Taylor?" [...] {{the face}} said, forming into place. It {{was an old}} face, gray and grim. [...] "This is Moss. I'm {{sorry to bother you}} during Rest Period, but <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> come up." [...] He rattled papers. [...] "I want you to hurry over here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; but, Frank, don't you {{see what}} I mean? <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> come to you, and you can't help it, and you are descended from these people really; {{but it would be}} choice for me, and I could not bear to feel that you were ashamed of me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] replied Herbert. [...] "I {{suppose you}} have studied my statement. I needn't say that I regret the way matters have turned out; but one can't foresee every {{turn of the}} market, or avoid a miscalculation now and then. It would hurt me if I thought <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> {{anything}} to do with your going to Stephen's." ...|$|R
60|$|Wrayson drew {{a sigh of}} relief. Perhaps, for {{the first}} time, he {{realized}} how great a weight <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> been upon his spirits. He had feared Heneage!--not this man, but the cold, capable Stephen Heneage of his earlier acquaintance; feared him not only for his own sake, but hers. After all, {{his visit to the}} Alhambra had brought some good to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{dare say}} <b>this</b> pretty <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> got over it--how much {{character}} she has got!--and I suppose she'll see somebody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a {{fool you}} are!" [...] Billings cried angrily. [...] "Haven't you got sense {{enough to see}} that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been done so's we'll run deeper in debt at the store, an' have to submit to a cut down when Wright gets ready to put the screws on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't think I'm mad," [...] he apologized, [...] "but I am not {{a person}} like you, Bellamy,--used to adventures {{and this sort of}} wild happenings. I'm a steady-going, matter-of-fact Englishman, and <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> been like a hateful {{nightmare}} to me. I can't believe that I'm {{going to get rid of}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare not}} think," [...] he said. [...] "I've won you by unfair means--and yet, knowing that, I'm only {{filled with the}} exultation of it. Still, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> to be faced and decided now. You know I love you--but is it right {{that you should be}} bound to a man who may never be able to marry you?" ...|$|E
30|$|Because I did not study. If I <b>had</b> studied well, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> wonâ€™t <b>have</b> {{happened}} to me. I have only myself to blame.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose I {{could have}} done so either in the old times," [...] Ned said with a faint smile. [...] "My blood used to be hot enough, a good deal too hot, but I don't think {{anything}} could get it up to boiling point now, so you see if <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> {{to be done at}} all it must have been in cold blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{daughter}} {{has told me}} what took place last night, and while, in one sense, I'm indebted to you, Ormesby, I really can't decide whether you showed a lamentable lack of judgment in abetting her," [...] he said. [...] "She is a brave little soul, but does not always spare time to think. Frankly, I wish <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> not come about as it did." ...|$|R
