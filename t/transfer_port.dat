5000|$|Scavenging: Around 75Â° of {{crankshaft}} rotation before BDC {{the exhaust}} valve or port opens, and blowdown occurs. Shortly thereafter the intake valve or <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> opens. The incoming charge displaces the remaining combustion gases to the exhaust {{system and a}} part of the charge may enter the exhaust system as well. The piston reaches BDC and reverses direction. After the piston has traveled a short distance upwards into the cylinder the exhaust valve or port closes; shortly the intake valve or <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> closes as well.|$|E
50|$|The piston {{then moves}} downward,where the air-fuel mixture remains from the {{previous}} intake-compression stroke. Shortly after the exhaust port is uncovered by the downward travel of the piston, the <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> begin to be uncovered. The <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> act as a passage through which the air-fuel mixture moves from the crankcase into the cylinder above the piston.

5000|$|New European {{emission}} {{laws have}} increased the pressure on two-stroke bikes, as their engines are less fuel efficient and produce more pollution than four-stroke motors. However, with newer advances in technology, two-strokes have begun to burn cleaner and pass stricter green standards. Starting in 2017, all newly registered motorcycles must conform with the Euro 4 regulations for emission management. In May 2017, KTM will unveil a new two-stroke engine with direct fuel injection. By pressure-injecting an electronically controlled amount of fuel into the <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> of the cylinder, the new TPI (<b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> injection) engines will be more fuel efficient and cleaner than classic carburetor two-stroke engines, albeit more complex and expensive. By 2018, 250 and 300 EXC TPI enduro models will be powered by the new engine.|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering for the MSc in Mechanical EngineeringComputational study of scavenging flow in a typical small vehicle engine is accomplished using multi-dimensional moving-mesh unsteady and quasi-steady models. A representative two-stroke 5 port engine was selected and sectioned to measure the geometrical features of the <b>transfer</b> <b>ports.</b> The commercial codes Auto CAD and Pro- Engineer was used to model the cylinder and ports. The commercial code Star-CD was {{used to analyze the}} unsteady gas exchange process within the engine combustion chamber soon after combustion. Pressure boundary conditions were used to represent crankcase conditions and exhaust tail pipe conditions at the scavenge port inlets and the exhaust port exit respectively. The simulation was stated at top-dead-centre (TDC) after combustion, assuming no exhaust gas remained in the engine from the previous cycle. For moving-mesh calculation, a cycle simulation is performed in two stages, separated by a theoretical constant-volume combustion calculation. The TDC calculation was initialized using a preliminary simulation staring at the bottom-dead-centre (BDC) assuming no exhaust gas remained in the cylinder at the start of simulation at Parallel computing was used to run the simulation. Both quasi-steady and transient simulations indicate that typical multi-port inlet placement and timing allow significant short-circuiting of mixture, consistent with emissions observations. Residual gas is well scavenged from the hemi-spherical head cylinder. Backflow of combustion gasses into the <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> were observed upon opening of the <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> which indicate an inadequate blow down period. The inlet angles of the mixture from <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> are oriented upwards towards the dome of the cylinder and are satisfactory. The relative positioning and orientation of the scavenge ports promote good mixing and helps to reduce the inflow velocities, though considerable short-circuiting is still present in the engine.

50|$|This {{method of}} {{scavenging}} uses carefully shaped and positioned <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> {{to direct the}} flow of fresh mixture toward the combustion chamber as it enters the cylinder.

5000|$|Some SI {{engines are}} {{crankcase}} scavenged {{and do not}} use poppet valves. Instead the crankcase and {{the part of the}} cylinder below the piston is used as a pump. The intake port is connected to the crankcase through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine. For each cylinder a <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> connects in one end to the crankcase and in the other end to the cylinder wall. The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall. The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston. The reed valve opens when the crankcase pressure is slightly below intake pressure, to let it be filled with a new charge; this happens when the piston is moving upwards. When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in the crankcase increases and the reed valve closes promptly, then the charge in the crankcase is compressed. When the piston is moving upwards, it uncovers the exhaust port and the <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> and the higher pressure of the charge in the crankcase makes it enter the cylinder through the <b>transfer</b> <b>port,</b> blowing the exhaust gases. Lubrication is accomplished by adding 2-stroke oil to the fuel in small ratios. Petroil refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil. This kind of 2-stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4-strokes engines and release a more polluting exhaust gases for the following conditions: ...|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from large}} diesels with {{separate}} superchargers, two-stroke engines are generally piston-ported {{and use their}} crankcase beneath the piston for compression. The cylinder has a <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> (inlet from crankcase to cylinder) and an exhaust port cut into it. These are opened, as the piston moves downwards past them; with the higher exhaust port opening earlier as the piston descends; and closing later as the piston rises.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s DKW {{pioneered the}} SchnÃ¼rle {{two-stroke}} loop scavenging process {{to dispense with}} the use of a deflector piston and improve efficiency of the combustion chamber. DKW also developed a highly efficient arrangement of transfer ports. These two features were included in the RT 125 to great commercial advantage. Competitor companies such as Adler and TWN copied the adoption of flat-topped pistons and strove to develop equally <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> arrangements without infringing DKW's patent.|$|E

50|$|The engine {{had three}} {{horizontal}} cylinders, the outer {{two of which}} were power cylinders and the centre cylinder used as a scavenging pump. Each power cylinder contained two slightly oversquare opposed pistons with uniflow piston-porting. Unusually for a small two-stroke, there was no reliance on the Kadenacy effect. The <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> though were angle-drilled to encourage swirl.|$|R
50|$|In 1926, the German {{engineer}} Adolf SchnÃ¼rle {{developed the}} system of ports that bears his name. The ports were relocated to both {{be on the same}} side of the cylinder, with the <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> being split into two angled ports, one on either side of the exhaust port. A deflector piston was no longer required. The gas flow was now a circular loop, flowing in and across the piston crown from the transfer ports, up and around the combustion chamber and then out through the exhaust port.|$|E
5000|$|The cycle {{starts with}} the piston {{at the bottom of}} its stroke. As it rises, it draws air into the {{crankcase}} through the inlet port. At the same time fuel is sprayed into the vaporiser. The charge of air on top of the piston is compressed into the vaporiser, where it is mixed with the atomised fuel and ignites. The piston is driven down the cylinder. As it descends, the piston first uncovers the exhaust port. The pressurised exhaust gases flow out of the cylinder. A fraction after the exhaust port is uncovered, the descending piston uncovers the <b>transfer</b> <b>port.</b> The piston is now pressurising the air in the crankcase, which is forced through the <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> and into the space above the piston. Part of the incoming air charge is lost out of the still-open exhaust port to ensure all the exhaust gases are cleared from the cylinder, a process known as [...] "scavenging". The piston then reaches the bottom of its stroke and begins to rise again, drawing a fresh charge of air into the crankcase and completing the cycle. Induction and compression are carried out on the upward stroke, while power and exhaust occur on the downward stroke.|$|E
50|$|The HW (Hermann Weihrauch) 35 was {{the first}} air rifle with Weihrauchs famous Rekord 2-stage {{adjustable}} trigger and used a conventional piston and spring assembly. The spring is compressed by breaking the barrel through 125Â° before loading a pellet directly into the breach. The barrel was then returned into place and locked with a special Breech lock. The first production models had a leather piston seal with a 4mm diameter <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> {{but at the end}} of the 1970s Weihrauch switched to synthetic seals and a 2.8mm dia port from serial #843636.|$|E

This arrangement was patented by Scott in 1939, but is often mistakenly believed to be of post-war origin as it was later widely adopted for motorcycle racing engines and power boats after its reinvention in the late 1950s by East German motorcycle manufacturer MZ.|$|R
50|$|Glovebags help {{to confine}} {{contamination}} at the source, limiting the {{spread to the}} space inside the glovebag. Glovebag chambers can be fabricated in limitless shapes and sizes, forming a barrier to enclose a workspace. With attached glovesleeves that allow access for handling, <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> to move objects {{into and out of}} the chamber, and service sleeves for tooling and ventilation, glovebags can be made to accommodate a wide range of operations on hazardous material without directly touching the items.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{technical}} developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on 5 Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by non-return valve into the <b>transfer</b> <b>port,</b> with ball races for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet non-return valve {{is the subject of}} another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.|$|E
50|$|Direct-injection {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engines}} {{tend to use}} exhaust valves actuated either by camshafts or electronic control, rather than exhaust ports. This system is called uniflow scavenging. Opposed piston engines are inherently uniflow-scavenged, but these do use piston-controlled cylinder ports. Two-stroke opposed piston engines such as the Napier Deltic and Junkers Jumo 204 engines use one piston to control the inlet port and the other the exhaust, allowing more flexibility in timing. A variation {{of this approach is}} taken by the split-single engine, in which two cylinders share one combustion chamber, with the piston in one cylinder controlling the <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> and the other the exhaust port.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} a single transfer and single exhaust port, opposite each other. This [...] "cross scavenging" [...] performs poorly, as there is tendency for the flow to pass from the inlet directly to the exhaust, wasting some of the fuel mixture and also poorly scavenging {{the upper part of}} the chamber. Before Schnuerle porting, a deflector on top of the piston was used to direct the gas flow from the <b>transfer</b> <b>port</b> upwards, in a U-shaped loop around the combustion chamber roof and then down and out through the exhaust port. Apart from the gas flow never quite following this ideal path and tending to mix instead, this also gave a poorly shaped combustion chamber with long, thin flame paths.|$|E
50|$|The {{charge was}} an overly rich mixture of air, which was {{acquired}} through the hollow crankshaft, and fuel that was continuously injected by a fuel nozzle {{on the end}} of a fuel line, entering the crankcase through the hollow crankshaft. The nozzle was in the proximity of, and aimed at, the inside base of the cylinder where the <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> were located. The fuel nozzle was stationary with the crankshaft, and the cylinders rotated into position in turn. The compression stroke was conventional.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the piston}} travels upward in the cylinder, it creates low {{pressure}} area in the crankcase; this draws fresh air and atomized fuel from the carburetor {{through a hole in}} the cylinder wall or directly into the crankcase. As the piston continues travelling upward, <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> and the exhaust ports are closed off, thus trapping the combustible mixture in the combustion chamber. As the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the mixture in the cylinder is compressed to the point of ignition.|$|R
50|$|This forward-moving barrel {{has given}} rise to the view that the Gat is not an air weapon at all, but simply a spring catapult. This is incorrect. The piston is a leather seal around the outside of the inner barrel, running in a larger {{concentric}} cylinder within the receiver. The barrel and piston are driven forward when fired, air passing into the chamber from two small <b>transfer</b> <b>ports</b> drilled {{at the rear of the}} barrel, just ahead of the leather seal.|$|R
