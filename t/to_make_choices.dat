5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices,</b> rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E

At certain points, the player gets <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|Training {{can help}} the user make use of their AAC system to {{communicate}} effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices,</b> decisions and mistakes. Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic. Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person's native language {{as well as the}} linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.|$|E

5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|Key's third game Clannad is {{a visual}} novel similar to Key's {{previous}} games, but contains no adult content. Clannad {{was meant to}} be released in 2002, but was delayed, leading to the game finally being released on April 28, 2004. Seven months after Clannads release, Key released their shortest game, , on November 29, 2004 with a rating for all ages. Planetarian, in contrast to Key's past games, is a linear visual novel that does not require the user <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> during gameplay; this is what is referred to as a kinetic novel. The brand's fifth game is , an adult game and spin-off to Clannad released on November 25, 2005, which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami from Clannad. Key released their sixth game, Little Busters!, on July 27, 2007 with no adult content, but released another version of the game entitled Little Busters! Ecstasy on July 25, 2008 with added adult content, story, and visuals.|$|E
5|$|The player assumes {{control of}} the protagonist, a teenage human girl. As the game follows a {{branching}} plot line with multiple endings, at various points during gameplay the player is allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> that determine which character's romance route the player will encounter. On weekdays, the player can also choose which classes to attend, which changes one of the protagonist's three stats depending on the activity chosen. Having certain stat values are required to obtain the good endings for each love interest and to otherwise advance along certain routes. There are thirteen (fourteen in the 2014 remake) endings in total: one ending {{for each of the}} main love interests, three extended endings for three of the love interests based on stat values, one ending for the gaiden-esque Torimi Café storyline, and one ending attained if the player fails to romance any character.|$|E

25|$|Speech rate {{is closely}} related to {{cognitive}} load of speakers as well. Depending on the cognitive load, the rates of a speaker's utterances are produced either faster or slower, in comparison to a fixed speaking rate which happens usually. For example, speech rate becomes slower when having <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> that are not anticipated, and tend to accelerate when words are being repeated.|$|E
25|$|Porter {{wrote in}} 1980 that {{companies}} have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> about their scope {{and the type}} of competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost. Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and activities performed by organizations as part of their value chain is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.|$|E

This study proposes a model that describes the dynamics of information generation and transmissions and conducts an analysis to investigate the conditions that allow travellers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> efficient <b>choices.</b> It is shown that suppressing rapid diffusions of information and encouraging intentional searching for information can help travellers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> efficient <b>choices...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{standard}} ethical theory, respecting dignity {{can also be}} aligned with having a respect for people and their autonomous choices. People are then enabled {{to make decisions about}} their own treatment. Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> about their own treatment due to being incapacitated or having a mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.|$|E
25|$|Some {{conceive}} {{free will}} {{to be the}} capacity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived. This problem has been identified in ancient Greek philosophy, and remains {{a major focus of}} philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism, and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism, the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and hard determinism, the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses hard incompatibilism, which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will, and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.|$|E
25|$|That said, {{the score}} does allow the {{interpreter}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> {{on how to}} perform a historical work. For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), {{it is not known}} exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part (only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).|$|E

Some X-Files fans have categorized the Smoking Man as evil, making him {{out to be the}} villain.

500|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} {{violence}} and the abuse of power, {{as well as of}} coming of age. The protagonists have a recurring struggle <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> they are comfortable with. Their moral development takes place within the harshness of the Upland culture, contrasted with examples of kindness and altruism. It has been described as sharing themes of dreamworlds and choices with a number of other works by Le Guin, such as the Earthsea cycle, The Beginning Place, and [...] "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas". It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book Where the Wild Things Are, while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E
500|$|In hindsight, {{the team}} {{considered}} {{the story of}} Far Cry 3 [...] "great", even though they {{thought that it was}} separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>choices</b> that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending. The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign. Thompson added that they twisted the story of Far Cry 3 for Far Cry 4, and made outsiders the villains instead of the heroes. The team considered it a [...] "risk", but they wanted to try something different.|$|E

500|$|Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor, John's wife. Charlotte Gainsbourg was {{originally}} set {{to play the}} part, but left due to scheduling conflicts with another film. As portrayed by Claire Danes in the third film, Kate was a veterinarian; but in this film, she is now a physician. Howard suggested, {{as part of the}} character's backstory, that Kate studied medical books and interviewed many surviving doctors after the events of Judgment Day. The film's subject matter reminded her of developing countries, devastated by war and lacking basic supplies such as clean water, which [...] "reflects {{things that are going on}} currently in this privileged world that we are living in where there hasn't been an apocalypse and robots haven't taken over the world.

500|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to be [...] "genre-busting"—partly simulation, role-playing game, first-person shooter, and adventure.

Similar to a first-person shooter, the game uses a first-person perspective and includes shooting, but there are other non-violent gameplay options. Like an adventure game, Deux Ex is primarily based on a linear narrative story and item collection, though its puzzles are open-ended with many possible solutions and consequences.
