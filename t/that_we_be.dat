This is {{followed}} by a prayer <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> granted fellowship with the Saints. John the Baptist and fourteen martyrs, seven men and seven women, are mentioned by name.|$|E
500|$|John V. Karavitis, in {{the chapter}} [...] "The Finn-losophy of Adventure Time" [...] from the book Adventure Time and Philosophy, sees the {{situation}} at hand in a different light. According to him, magic and science clearly exist {{within the confines of}} Ooo, but more importantly, they also represent two completely different ways of viewing the world. Science is a way of [...] "observ the world, mak educated guesses about how it works and conduct expierments [...] in order to confirm or disprove our ideas about the world. [...] Science requires <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> rational, that we try to actively understand the world, and to take steps to verify our understanding." [...] In this sense, it is the ultimately responsible perspective. Magic, on the other hand, is [...] "the metaphysics of immaturity" [...] because it does not require understanding the reality of the actual world. Magic, according to Karavitis, is therefore an irresponsible perspective to take.|$|E

We ask <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> given the privacy our family needs to grieve at this difficult time." [...] The effect of Arthur's death on Cave and his family was explored in the 2016 documentary film One More Time with Feeling and on the 2016 album Skeleton Tree.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1910 the Qing {{government}} appointed Sando (or Sandowa), a Manchu {{himself and}} former deputy lieutenant governor of Guihwa, as viceroy of Mongolia {{in the capital}} city of Urga (modern Ulaanbaatar), to implement the New Administration. He immediately set about organizing twenty offices to oversee such matters as the military, taxation, police, government and commerce. Plans were made for the colonization of Mongolia with Chinese farmers. In January 1911 a Lieutenant Colonel Tang Zaili arrived to supervise the organization of a Mongolian army, half of which was to consist of Mongolian herdsmen. A 400-room barracks was erected near Urga. The Mongolians saw in all this a threat to their very survival. Their desperation was echoed in a petition to the Qing government: [...] "Among the many directives repeatedly issued, there is not one which benefits the Mongolians. Consequently, we all desire <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> allowed to live according to our ancient ways." [...] The arrogance and brutality of Tang Zaili’s staff and military escort did not help.|$|E

60|$|Now {{here comes}} in the whole {{collapse}} and huge blunder of our age. We have mixed up two different things, two opposite things. Progress should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always changing the world to suit the vision. Progress does mean (just now) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always changing the vision. It should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men: it does mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy: a wild page from any Prussian sophist makes men doubt it. Progress should mean <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> always walking towards the New Jerusalem. It does mean that the New Jerusalem is always walking away from us. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not altering the real to suit the ideal. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> altering the ideal: it is easier.|$|R
