5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large direct band gap of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> ~3–4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E

5000|$|You {{can create}} any <b>tuning</b> by <b>tuning</b> <b>to</b> the {{notes of the}} chord. If you play power chords most of the time, <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> a fifth chord by repeating the two notes in the chord. For example, the C5 chord is just notes C & G, so <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> that <b>tuning,</b> tune all of your strings to C or G. If you want <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> Csus4, you use the notes in that chord, so you would use the notes C,F, and G, <b>tuning</b> your strings <b>to</b> those notes. If the string tension gets too high, <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> a lower note, so you don't snap a string. One tip {{is to change the}} {{frequency}} of your tuner from around 440 to around 430. This prevent breaks and will lower the sound of your guitar as a whole, giving it more bass.|$|R
5|$|A four-stop continuo organ {{was built}} for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton-based organ builder Kenneth Tickell. The instrument, {{contained}} {{in a case of}} dark oak, is portable, and can be <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> three pitches: A=440Hz (modern concert pitch), A=415Hz and A=465Hz. Iit is also possible to tune at A=430. A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8' stop and, when released, returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known more {{generally}} as bistatic radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range {{on the order of}} , and the concept was abandoned for good.|$|E
5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare in classical or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato in classical music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
50|$|The {{receivers}} {{to which}} the watches can tune themselves vary by watch submodel. Casio mentions that in Europe, the watches will <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> the 77.5kHz low frequency time signal radio station DCF77 located at Mainflingen in Germany or 60kHz MSF at Anthorn (formerly transmitting from Rugby, Warwickshire) in the United Kingdom. In Europe the reception range is approximately 1500 kilometres. In the United States, they will <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> the 60kHz signal from WWVB at Fort Collins. In Japan, they will <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> the 40kHz signal from JJY at Mount Otakadoya, near Fukushima (Ohtakadoyayama) and the 60kHz signal from the Haganeyama Transmitter at Mount Hagane (Haganeyama). In China, they will <b>tune</b> <b>to</b> the 68kHz signal from BPC at Shangqiu. Some watches can register only some of these signals.|$|R

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the transmission, and the operator would {{listen for the}} signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E

5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the same {{standard}} lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> a specific frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes {{back at the}} finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|MAR used {{separate}} transmitter and receivers, {{a necessity}} {{at the time}} due {{to the size of}} the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse.|$|E

5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{television}} ratings {{indicated that}} 29.2% of televisions in the 56largest media {{markets in the}} United States were <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the inauguration, the largest audience since Ronald Reagan's first inauguration in 1981 and nearly double the viewership of the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush. The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51%of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed {{in part to a}} snowstorm that kept people inside and in part to the large African American population in that community. Of the top 10media markets in terms of viewership, four were in North Carolina, two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland, with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership. In addition, schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday.|$|E
5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E

5|$|The {{second is}} the {{circular}} bodied plucked lute, the yueqin. Percussion instruments include the daluo, xiaoluo, and naobo. The player of the gu and ban, a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, Xipi and Erhuang, originally differed in subtle ways. In the Xipi style, the strings of the jinghu are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In Erhuang, on the other hand, the strings are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including manban (a slow tempo), yuanban (a standard, medium-fast tempo), kuai sanyan ("leading beat"), daoban ("leading beat"), sanban ("rubato beat"), and yaoban ("shaking beat"). The xipi style also uses several unique tempos, including erliu ("two-six"), and kuaiban (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, yuanban, manban, and kuaiban are most commonly seen. The tempo {{at any given time}} is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational, and Xipi as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.|$|E
5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> provide the desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined {{a series of}} low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{clouds are}} very {{difficult}} to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them. However, a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector (AVOID) has recently been developed by Nicarnica Aviation, a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km (62 mi) ahead and fly safely around them. The system uses two fast-sampling infrared cameras, mounted on a forward-facing surface, that are <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> detect volcanic ash. This system can detect ash concentrations of <1 mg/m3 to > 50 mg/m3, giving pilots approximately 7–10 minutes warning. The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company.|$|E
