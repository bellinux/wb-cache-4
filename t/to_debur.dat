Several attempts were made to minimize burr <b>to</b> suppress <b>deburring</b> <b>to</b> improve productivity. <b>Deburring</b> of the surface in shaping operation in railways industry and other industries is a great problem. An investigation on burr formation at the exit edge of aluminum alloy (4600 -M) flats in shaping operation is done in this work under dry environment. It is found out that burr is negligible at 15 0 exit edge bevel angle. Distribution of shear stress is analyzed using FEM to validate the experimental results. It is found that maximum equivalent stress and deformation at different points on the 15 0 exit edge bevel angle become minimum justifying the experimental observation. Hence, an exit edge bevel of 15 0 may be adopted to have minimum burr formation...|$|R

The mechanical integrity of these machined components may be compromised {{by the presence}} of burrs and sharp edges. Therefore the removal of burrs and the creation of rounded edges is necessary. To do this manually is time consuming and costly and may have potential quality issues. The application of robots <b>to</b> <b>deburring</b> has been limited by the difficulties in achieving the required degree of quality, controlling reaction forces during metal removal and the lack of tooling designed specifically for robots. The work presented in this paper introduces an efficient robotic deburring method, which is developed based on generation real-time robotic deburring path. The approach uses an in-process measurement sensor to determine the component's exact location prior <b>to</b> the <b>deburring</b> operation.

Reducing the reliance on accurate dedicated part holding fixtures and uses laser guided robot ensures the developed deburring system is highly flexible and re-configurable.

Burrs are created around the edge of workpiece due to plasticity during mechanical manufacturing process. Recently, because of miniaturization and increased precision of the machined parts, the size of burrs has been also reduced and deburring became even more difficult. Generally, burrs have been removed by method of physics and chemistry.

One of the main concerns in mi- cromachining is burr formation which can incur high production costs due <b>to</b> time-consuming <b>deburring</b> operations. Although deburring operations are commonly carried out in macroscale milling, in micro machining they can be difficult to use. De- burring processes can destroy delicate microfeatures and are usually unfeasible at the micro scale. For this reason, the utiliza- tion of burr minimizing machining tool paths is desirable. Optimum tool paths minimize burr formation while satisfying sur- face quality requirements, dimensional tolerances, and cycle time constraints. A new concept for micro end milling tool paths is developed. An integrated performance index using the Taguchi method is introduced to optimize the main microscale end milling process outputs: surface quality, edge accuracy, burr formation, and time constraints.

My mission within this company was to realize work instructions for deburring of robot cells. To explain this mission, first we are going to explain the goal, and then we are going to present the different steps to complete this mission. The goal of this mission is to improve the manufacturing process of parts, and so to improve the production. All of this, by establishing working instructions allowing automated deburring operations on parts. The first thing was to have a provisional repertoire of parts which are machined on robot cell on which I worked. With this list, I determined articles on which I had to make modifications. Indeed, improvements must be made on parts having the largest machining time for month on the robot cell. The second step was to make an inventory of parts previously targeted, <b>to</b> identify different <b>deburring</b> there are <b>to</b> perform during machining.

I also had to look for innovative tools in the field of automated deburring, which were not present in the workshop. Then, I formed a work instruction file already ready to be filled to facilitate the creation of work instructions. So I had to implement a suitable format and to choose an interesting and relevant location for work instructions for deburring of robot cells. The choice of location was to be decided with the opinion of machine operators, who are, of course, the first people concerned by these work instruction.

The desired robot movement can be realized by proper trajectory planning using the computer-aided design (CAD) model of the manufactured workpiece. A fundamental problem is that geometric shape deviations between the nominal CAD model and the manufactured parts might be beyond acceptable limits for correct execution of the deburring process. This paper proposes a novel, easy to implement and practical approach to detect shape deviations of workpieces for automatic adaptation of robotic deburring processes. The approach only uses dimensional tolerance specifications of the manufactured part provided by the product design to derive possible variations of the workpiece geometry model.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} Robotic Deburring (RD) can be effectively {{enhanced by the}} availability of methods and integrated tools capable of quickly analyzing the overall process performance in a virtual environment. On the other hand, despite the current availability of several CAM tools, the tuning of an RD process parameters is still mainly based on several physical tests, which drastically reduce the robotic cell productivity. The reason is that several potential sources of errors, which are unavoidable in the physical cell, are simply neglected in state-of-the-art CAM software. For instance, {{the effectiveness of a}} RD process is highly influenced by the limited accuracy of the robot motions and by the unpredictable variety of burr size/shape. In most cases, it is strictly necessary to maintain a uniform contact pressure between the tool and the workpiece at all times, despite the burr thickness, so that either an active force feedback or a passive compliant spindle must be employed. Focusing on the latter solution, the present paper proposes a Virtual Prototype (VP) of a radially-compliant spindle, suitable <b>to</b> quickly assess <b>deburring</b> efficiency in different case scenarios. The proposed VP is created by integrating a 3 D multi-body model of the spindle mechanical structure with the behavioural model of the process forces. Differently from previous literature and from state-of-the-art CAM packages, the proposed VP allows to quickly estimate the process forces (accounting for the presence of workpiece burr and tool compliance) and the optimal deburring parameters, which are readily provided as contour maps of the envisaged deburring error as function of the cutting parameters.

Processing objectives are varied, ranging from the cosmetic to the functionally critical. One such critical application is the hydraulically smooth polishing of aero engine component gas-washed surfaces. In this, and many other applications the drive to improve process control and finish tolerance is ever present. Considering its widespread use mass finishing has seen limited research activity, particularly with respect to surface characterization. The objectives of the current paper are to; characterise the mass finished stratified surface and its development process using areal surface parameters, provide guidance on the optimal parameters and sampling method to characterise this surface type for a given application, and detail the spatial variation in surface topography due to coupon edge shadowing. Blasted and peened square plate coupons in titanium alloy are wet (vibro) mass finished iteratively with increasing duration. Measurement fields are precisely relocated between iterations by fixturing and an image superimposition alignment technique. Surface topography development is detailed with âlog of process durationâ plots of the âareal parameters for scale-limited stratified functional surfacesâ, (the Sk family). Characteristic features of the Smr 2 plot are seen to map out the processing of peak, core and dale regions in turn. These surface process regions also become apparent in the âlog of process durationâ plot for Sq, where lower core and dale regions are well modelled by logarithmic functions. Surface finish (Ra or Sa) with mass finishing duration is currently predicted with an exponential model. This model is shown to be limited for the current surface type at a critical range of surface finishes. Statistical analysis provides a group of areal parameters including; Vvc, Sq, and Sdq, showing optimal discrimination for a specific range of surface finish outcomes.
