It then runs in a more or less southeastern direction and then west again in the Grubental valley along the Grubensiepen (tributary of the Latrop) and its tributary, the Schladebach, past the Altarstein (heathen sacrifice site; 536.2 m) and the natural monument known as the Dicke Eiche ("Fat Oak", 482.7 m) to the village of Latrop in the Latrop valley (430 m; southeastern municipality of Schmallenberg).

40|$|International audienceIn {{the western}} Alps, the NE {{trending}} Belledonne fault system {{extends from the}} Mont Blanc massifs in the NE to the Vercors massif in the SW. It includes the Belledonne border fault, defined by an alignment of micro earthquakes (ML <= 3. 5). Focal mechanisms and their respective depths indicate a crustal scale NE trending dextral strike-slip faulting. This study aims at better constraining the geometry, the fault kinematics and slip rate of the faults of the Belledonne fault system by using a multidisciplinary approach that includes tectonics, geomorphology and geophysics. New clues of potential Quaternary deformations are observed: 1 - the right-lateral offsets of morphologic markers (<b>talwegs)</b> along the NE trending Arcalod fault at the north-eastern termination of the Belledonne border fault; 2 - the left-lateral offset of the valley carved by the Isere glacier along the NW trending Brion fault, {{which is consistent with}} the fault kinematics deduced from the focal mechanisms. Stream network anomalies along the Belledonne border fault are related to glacial erosion processes rather than faulting. However, fault kinematics analysis along the Belledonne border fault allows us to determine a strike-slip tectonic regime characterized by horizontal ENE trending sigma 1 stress axis. It is consistent with the mean trend of the P and T axes deduced from the focal mechanisms. We display evidences that this stress state is Messinian to Quaternary in age and occurred after an Oligocene to Messinian strike-slip tectonic regime characterized by horizontal WNW trending sigma 1. Fault slip rates cannot be assessed {{because of the lack of}} morphologic features with constrained ages. However, it is likely that the presented geomorphic markers are older than Wurm.

40|$|International audienceWe propose two new {{approaches}} regarding recent fault offset measurements {{by studying the}} seismogenic potential of the Jasneuf Fault. The NE trending right-lateral strike-slip Jasneuf Fault is the southwestern extension of the Belledonne fault system in the Vercors Massif. This fault, which is located in an intraplate domain, does not show strongly associated seismicity but displays morphological anomalies {{that are related to}} recent faulting (right-lateral offset of Late Cenozoic cliffs, recent <b>talwegs,</b> and post Ganz scarps). The two methods that we use to quantify fault slip are as follows. 1 - Recursive measurements of stream offsets are conducted. This analysis reveals that a stream network can display characteristic distances between streams that can be mistakenly interpreted as long-term cumulative fault offsets. A comparison of the apparent stream offset values and stream spacing values is necessary to identify the true offsets. 2 - We propose a new method that enables us to determine the fault offset and kinematics by using recursive measurements of topographic apparent offsets to counter the lack of morphologic features that are used to determine piercing points or lines. This method enables us to define each possible slip vector for numerous artificial piercing points along a fault. The slip vector that is shared by these piercing points is the true slip vector. By applying these methodologies, we determine that the Jasneuf Fault has accumulated slip since the Messinian, which corresponds to an average slip rate of 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 mm year The extension of the fault is poorly constrained. Nevertheless, if we do not consider the potential aseismic (creep slip) component of the faulting, we calculate that this fault could generate Mw 5. 7 earthquakes every similar to 500 years according to Wells and Coppersmith's scaling laws and by assuming that the faulting is limited to the sedimentary cover and the Vercors Plateau.

40|$|En terrain volcanique, les eaux de pluie s'infiltrent jusqu'à leur {{rencontre}} avec un niveau imperméable qui correspond le plus souvent au socle cristallin. Ce sont les <b>talwegs</b> et les lignes de crête des paléo- reliefs de ce socle dont la profondeur peut dépasser la centaine de mètres qu'il convient de détecter, parfois avec une précision décamétrique. La méthode géophysique la plus utilisée en hydrogéologie des terrains volcaniques est la prospection électrique qui fournit des coupes verticales des résistivités électriques. La morphologie du substratum imperméable ou saturé peut aussi être obtenue en mesurant en surface les potentiels électriques de polarisation spontanée (en abrégé PS) qui se forment par la percolation de l'eau infiltrée dans le terrain poreux. La base de la zone non saturée, appelée surface SPS, est calculée par une relation faisant intervenir les données PS, les altitudes et deux coefficients définis à partir des données géologiques. Cette surface indique directement les axes de circulation et les lignes de partage des eaux. Deux exemples pris sur des sites bien documentés montrent la validité de la méthode pour localiser les axes de circulation de l'eau souterraine et les limites entre bassins versants. Un troisième exemple montre les résultats PS comparés à ceux des méthodes électromagnétiques VLF et AMT. La méthode PS est légère et offre une bonne précision horizontale, mais elle demande au moins un forage d'étalonnage pour préciser la profondeur des interfaces. Hydrogeological prospecting poses great {{problems in}} volcanic areas, particularly on volcanic islands. Despite a generally high rainfall in these areas, the high mean permeability of volcanic rocks results {{in only a}} few easily exploited resources. Volcanic rocks form a particular case of geophysical prospecting with respect to hydrogeological research. Indeed these formations are characterised by specific hydrological and geophysical parameters, which generally possess two features. First, there are heterogeneous systems composed of non-stratified layers. Acceptable modelling of these structures requires an extensive coverage of data. Generally only light equipment and simple methods can be used. Also, the electrical parameters of volcanoclastics are often very different from those of their surrounding rocks, so geoelectrical methods are generally used in volcanic areas, namely the electrical resistivity and self-potential methods. The Self-Potential (SP) method gives very good results because SP effects in volcanoclastics are strong. In volcanic areas it has been used for the last twenty years for geothermal and hydrogeological research. It is a measure at the Earth's surface of the natural electric potentials generated in the ground by streaming potential, due to ground water flowing through the porous rock medium. This medium becomes polarised. The principles of data interpretation can be summarised as follows. There is a linear correlation between the range of negative SP anomaly and the thickness of the vadose zone when two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is a high ratio between the resistivity of the vadose zone, and the resistivities of the substratum and the water-saturated zone. The second condition is the homogeneity of the vadose zone. If these two conditions are met, it is possible to define a geophysical surface called SPS, calculated from the SP and topographic data. The SPS is both an equipotential SP surface and the interface between the vadose zone and the saturated medium below. Drainage courses and watersheds are located exactly on the valleys and the ridge lines of the SPS respectively. The survey should be carried out using a high density of measurements, because underground water circulation can sometimes be confined to narrow <b>talwegs.</b> Nevertheless, the analysis of profiles across a valley does not always accurately indicate a narrow flow within the valley, and it is then necessary to run several mechanical probe-tests to locate the underground channel. Two well-documented examples focus on the groundwater flow below a basaltic lava flow, recognised partly by boreholes (Chaîne des Puys, France). In the first example, the water is channelled along a gallery where the contact between volcanic rocks and granite can be clearly observed. The valley of SPS is narrow and corresponds {{to the end of the}} gallery to within 10 m, at 75 m below the surface. In the second example, a SP map with a surface of 5 km 2 shows the boundary between two basins, the second being intersected by an impermeable zone. A third example concerns the shield volcano of Piton de la Fournaise (Réunion Island, Indian Ocean), considered as a pile of permeable lavas. Four electrical methods, Self-Potential (SP), Audio-Magneto-Telluric (AMT), Very-Low-Frequency (VLF), Electrical Sounding (ES), were used to provide some information on the groundwater system. The comparison among these methods shows that the SP method is the best method to identify in detail the upper vadose zone, whereas the AMT method is able to identify deeper layers, but without much precision. The comparison between electrical resistivity and SP methods was studied from a practical point of view, in terms of horizontal and vertical precision and accessibility. Finally, the paper describes practical aspects of the SP method, including SPS calculation methods, specific equipment, field measurement procedures, and disruptions due to anthropogenic factors...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEffective {{erosion control}} {{requires}} both a sound {{understanding of the}} physical context and sufficient motivation {{on the part of}} farmers to act, and in Europe this almost inevitably depends on financial subsidies. In south-west France, intense spring and summer storms lead to large scale sediment deposition on roadways, and cleanup costs are a major concern for local authorities. Current erosion control subsidy rates are not sufficient to encourage farmers to limit erosion and reduce cleanup costs. The objective {{of this study was to}} define the topographic characteristics which control sediment deposition on roadways in order to compare the cost of planting grass strips along these roads to current cleanup costs. Topographic conditions were characterised by midslope inclination (with a range of from 6 to 8 %) and distance of this slope to the road (range of 50 – 200 m), and these were defined by a combination of field visits, air photos, and GIS techniques. The effect of grass buffer strips on sediment deposition was estimated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The financial benefits of planting grass strips were based on the estimated efficiency of the buffer strips and the length of roads affected according to the topographic conditions. More than 70 % of roads requiring regular cleanup occur within 200 m of a midlsope inclination of 6 %. Errors in predicting sediment deposition sites according to topography occur mainly when small scale changes in topography are beneath the resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or when sediment deposition occurs due to the intersection of <b>talwegs</b> with roads. Modelling the effects of grass strips on soil erosion rates suggests that buffer strips of 12 or 24 m wide reduce sediments leaving the field by 32 and 54 %, respectively. Planting grass buffer strips along predicted problem road sections can reduce cleanup costs associated with sediment deposition. Savings in the first year of planting are in the order of about 2 % of current estimated cleanup costs (100, 000) for 12 m wide strips, and this amount increases to almost 35 % in subsequent years for 24 m strips. Savings in cleanup costs can be used to increase erosion control subsidies, thereby ensuring a higher level of farmer participation. In addition to reducing sediment deposition on roadways, the grass buffer strips serve as demonstration plots for the farming community. The strategy does not directly eliminate soil degradation upslope, but it is a first step towards better erosion control...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new theory}} and discussions about the motion of avalanches from initiation to run-out over a generally curved and twisted complicated mountain topography, its numerical simulation and comparison with well controlled, advanced laboratory experiments. It is hoped to be demonstrated that today's method of determination of the avalanche motion along its track promises {{to give to the}} avalanche practitioner a tool with the aid of which fairly reliable predictions of avalanche motion along its track can be made, from initiation to run-out. The model computations and experiments also allow inferences as to the distribution of the mass of different granulates, like gravel or snow, in the deposition zone {{as well as to the}} forces exerted on structures that are affected by the motion of the avalanche. To achieve this aim, a well known depth integrated avalanche model of Savage & Hutter is generalised to arbitrary channelised topographies, the intention being that the model would be able not only to describe the flow of snow, gravel, debris or mud, down a corrie of arbitrary curvature and twist and arbitrary cross sectional profile, but equally also the transportation of grains or pills in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industry, respectively. For the first time we were able to include the simultaneous effects of the curvature and torsion in the avalanche motion, which could not be achieved by previous models. The applicability of the present model equations is, therefore, much broader than in the previous cases. The flow down an inclined plane or within a channel with its axis in a vertical plane which may be curved can be described, as can the flow down complicated mountain valleys with arbitrarily curved and twisted <b>talwegs</b> and bed topographies. The new theory is ideally suited to realistic situations in connection with the use of Geographical Information and Visualisation Systems. Thus, the theory provides an entirely new direction in the field of avalanche and debris flow research. It also opens a large spectrum of applications in different industrial and geophysical problems. The emerging equations for the distribution of the avalanche thickness and the topography-parallel depth-averaged velocity components consist of non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations with discontinuous coefficients. To avoid any spurious oscillations and include naturally induced shock phenomena we introduced shock-capturing numerical schemes. To this end, two-dimensional Non-Oscillatory Central schemes with higher order cell reconstructions and second order accurate Total Variation Diminishing limiters were implemented. One of the most interesting aspects of avalanche dynamics is the study of avalanching motion over different bed structures and the effect of topography on their motion and deposits. We performed several numerical tests for avalanching masses down curved and twisted bed topographies. Uniformly and non-uniformly curved and twisted channels as well as channels which incorporate confined and unconfined continuous transition zones with constant and variable cross-sectional topographies merging into the horizontal run-out zones are considered. They demonstrate the combined effects of curvature, torsion and the radial acceleration associated with the bed topography. Thus, we are able to quantify the intrinsic effects of the topography and, finally, disclose the unknown physics of flows of avalanches through generally curved and twisted channels. Such sophisticated studies have not been carried out before, and it was possible here only with the new model equations. In order to acquire confidence in new model equations it is vital to corroborate them by direct observation. In this spirit, we performed several laboratory experiments for different granular materials to check the validity of the theory. We used a modern measurement technique, the Particle Image Velocimetry, to measure the velocity field of the flowing particles at the free-surface and the bottom of the free-surface and unsteady motion of an unconfined avalanche over a chute that is curved in the main flow direction merging continuously into the horizontal run-out zone. We are able to demonstrate the fact that there are excellent agreements between the theoretical predictions of the model equations and the experimental measurements. This, ultimately, proves the applicability of the theory and efficiency of the numerical method and code and establishes a nice and strong correlation among the theory, numerics and the experiments...|$|R

In all study periods the largest amplitude of daily fluctuations in intensity of transpiration occurred in leaves of plants along the <b>talweg,</b> at other test sites the limits were much lower.

40|$|AbstractThe {{upper reach}} of the Yellow River from Daliushu to Shapotou {{consists}} of five bends and has complex topography. A two-dimensional Re-Normalisation Group (RNG) k-ε model was developed to simulate the flow in the reach. In order to take the circulation currents in the bends into account, the momentum equations were improved by adding an additional source term. Comparison of the numerical simulation with field measurements indicates that the improved two-dimensional depth-averaged RNG k-ε model can improve {{the accuracy of the}} numerical simulation. A rapid adaptive algorithm was constructed, which can automatically adjust Manning's roughness coefficient {{in different parts of the}} study river reach.

In this paper, the author conducted the various analyses for the above data includinga spectral analysis, and revealed some interesting characteristics concerning for the sedi-ment distribution and the river bed variation. Main results are as follows, Torrentsinto the main river have large effects on the sediment distribution along the main river, andthe sediment from the torrents does not follow to the relation between the grain-sizeand the shear velocity found in the main river. River bed variations are composed of three scale components; dunes, bars and thelarger scale configuration. The scale of dunes is less than the river breadth, but has large amplitude which hasan important effect on the bank protection. Two or more prominent wave length ofdunes were obtained by the spectral analysis. Bar is due to the meander and the length(a hafe of meander length) is about 3 - 4 times of river breadth. The larger scalecomponent {{may be due to the}} variation of the river geomorphology.

From the pre-pottery Neolithic onwards, permanent habitation sites appear, related to the presence of perennial water. But the density of the occupation sites as well as the conditions of soil use, the limitations to which man had to adapt, often changed according to cycles, which have deeply affected the recent geological history of the valley. These often recurring modifications were diverse in nature: covering by alluvial sediments or on the contrary, reincision of the <b>talweg,</b> climatic oscillations, historical recompositions or impacts of human intervention. These different factors were often tightly interwoven. It is difficult to detect causal relationships and to measure their influence, as this certainly varied strongly, as much in place as in time.

40|$|Measurements in a braided {{reach of}} the proglacial White River, Washington, are {{used to compare the}} bed load {{capacity}} and competence of flow over the predominant gravel bed and over a narrow ribbon of mobile sand which extended alongside the <b>talweg.</b> Analysis of 144 velocity profiles and 222 bed load samples shows that shear stress and roughness height were significantly lower over sand than gravel, but maximum bed load diameter and total gravel transport rate significantly higher, as were transport rates of given size fractions at similar shear stresses. These differences in competence and capacity are explained by relative size effects on the threshold shear stress for entrainment. The influence on gravel transport of local variation in bed material size may explain the self-sorting of “bed load sheets” described by other workers. However, in channels like that described here the continuous longitudinal ribbon of sand allows the flow to develop a lower shear stress over the smoother bed, which partly offsets the relative size effects on competence and capacity...|$|E

This decline in slope is associated with rapid downstream fining of the gravel bed followed by an abrupt transition to a sand bed. The channel pattern alters progressively rather than abruptly, in the sequence (1) near-braided, (2) meandering with active point-bar chutes, (3) meandering with active outer-bank <b>talweg,</b> (4) stable equiwidth sinuous. The changes in channel pattern and hydraulic geometry are predicted better by rational approaches based on critical shear stress or other physical cdncepts than by purely empirical discriminant or trend equations. Measurements in five reaches confirm a downstream decrease in shear stress and the amount and calibre of bedload.

40|$|Abstract The {{classical}} Lojasiewicz {{inequality and}} its extensions for partial differential equation problems (Simon) and to o-minimal structures (Kurdyka) have a considerable {{impact on the}} analysis of gradient-like methods and related problems: minimization methods, complexity theory, asymptotic analysis of dissipative partial differential equations, tame geometry. This paper provides alternative characterizations {{of this type of}} inequalities for nonsmooth lower semicontinuous functions defined on a metric or a real Hilbert space. In a metric context, we show that a generalized form of the Lojasiewicz inequality (hereby called the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality) relates to metric regularity and to the Lipschitz continuity of the sublevel mapping, yielding applications to discrete methods (strong convergence of the proximal algorithm). In a Hilbert setting we further establish that asymptotic properties of the semiflow generated by −∂f are strongly linked to this inequality. This is done by introducing the notion of a piecewise subgradient curve: such curves have uniformly bounded lengths if and only if the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality is satisfied. Further characterizations in terms of <b>talweg</b> lines —a concept linked to the location of the less steepest points at the level sets of f — and integrability conditions are given.

It should be stressed that the described procedure is proposed purely as a preliminary analysis based on topography only, and therefore does not intend in any way to replace more sophisticated analysis methods requiring based on hydraulic modelling. The reference elevation model is a combination of the digital terrain model and the digital building model (DTM+DBM). The option of using the standard surface model (DSM) is not viable, as the DSM represents the vegetation canopy as a solid volume. This has the consequence of unrealistically considering the vegetation as a geometric obstacle to water flow. In some cases the topographic model construction requires the identification and digitization of the principal breaklines, such as river banks, ditches and similar natural or artificial structures. The geometrical and topological procedure for the validation of the hydraulic hazard maps is made of two steps. In the first step the whole area is subdivided into fluvial segments, with length chosen as a reasonable trade-off between the need to keep the hydrographical unit as complete as possible, and the need to separate sections of the river bed with significantly different morphology. Each of these segments is made of a single elongated polygon, whose shape can be quite complex, especially for meandering river sections, where the flow direction (i. e. the potential energy gradient associated to the <b>talweg)</b> is often inverted. In the second step the segments are analysed one by one. Therefore, each segment was split into many reaches, so that within any of them the slope of the piezometric line can be approximated to zero. As a consequence, the hydraulic profile (open channel flow) in every reach is assumed horizontal both downslope and on the cross-section. Each reach can be seen as a polygon, delimited laterally by the hazard mapping boundaries and longitudinally by two successive cross sections, usually orthogonal to the <b>talweg</b> line. Simulating the progressive increase of the river stage, with a horizontal piezometric line, allow the definition of the stage-area and stage-volume relationships. Such relationships are obtained exclusively by the geometric information as provided by the high resolution elevation model. The maximum flooded area resulting from the simulation is finally compared to the potentially floodable area described by the hazard maps, to give a flooding index for every reach. Index values lower than 100...|$|E
40|$|Side-scan sonar imagery, 40 in$ sp 3 $ sleeve gun and 3. 5 kHz {{high-resolution}} profiles {{reveal a}} dichotomy {{of the upper}} Labrador Slope into (i) a low-relief sector off Hudson Strait that is dominated by mass-transport deposits resulting from the direct input of subglacially derived debris, and (ii) a high-relief sector to the south resulting mainly from deposition out of turbid surface plumes, and headward canyon erosion. This dichotomy continues in the Labrador Basin, where the leveed Northwest Atlantic Mid-Ocean Channel (NAMOC) is flanked by a sandy submarine braidplain in the east, which is the basinward extension of the differences on the upper slope. The floodplain west of NAMOC contains extensive debris-flow deposits generated on the Labrador Slope. The meandering low-sinuosity, low-gradient NAMOC contains three segments: In the upper equilibrium channel, channel morphology is in equilibrium with spill-over from low-velocity, low-density upper portions of turbidity currents flowing in the channel; in the middle modified equilibrium channel, equilibrium morphology is altered by the confluence with tributary channels, and in the lower segment, channel morphology and position is controlled by basement topography (oceanic fracture zones and seamounts). The NAMOC levees interfinger with the braidplain deposits {{to the east and}} prograde southeastward in 7 - 8 packages. Most packages show a strong cross-channel decrease in thickness, and a strong asymmetry between {{the left and the right}} levee, as a Coriolis effect. The braidplain east of the NAMOC, which developed simultaneously with and prior to the NAMOC, shows a north to south gradient from laterally very extensive to highly channelized deposits. In the channelized part, channel positions change rapidly and deposits vary from sandy to gravelly. Extensive sheet-like turbidity currents on the braidplain may have been caused by catastrophic outbursts of subglacial lakes during times of ice-stream surges. Quantitative morphological analysis shows that the NAMOC is characterized by particularly low sinuosities due to very low channel-gradients compared to other submarine channels. The channel displays several features not recognized before in the deep-sea, or not in the same detail; including submarine hanging valleys and chute pools, submarine point-bars within the channel, coarse-grained wash-over fans on the lee-side of the levees, and terraces within the channel. The <b>talweg</b> is variable in depth and meanders within the channel. An up to 80 m deep <b>talweg</b> is present in the distal NAMOC resulting from flow restrictions due to seamounts. Channel morphology as well as grain size of spill-over deposits suggest that the flow tops of turbidity currents in the NAMOC are slow ($<$ 0. 7 m/s) and dilute ($<$ 12 kg/m$ sp 3 $). Gravel deposits in the channel require velocities of 6. 5 - 8 m/s for suspension transport, suggesting a strong vertical velocity and density gradient...|$|E

The meter was placed at 3 m increments of width and at 0. 10 – 0. 45 m increments of depth in 13 cross-sections of the meander. Hardy's multiquadric method of interpolation, using a cone model, was implemented to estimate and map speeds more fully for each cross-section. The multiquadric system of equations was evaluated {{for a range of}} about 7 – 11 (× 103) locations in each of nine shallow cross-sections in the upstream limb of the meander and for about 22 – 63 (× 103) locations in each of four deeper sections in the downstream limb. These evaluated speeds were grouped into colour-coded classes and plotted to show the distribution of speeds in each cross-section. In all but two sections, there was one concentration of higher speeds which shifted towards the outer bank of the meander. The other two sections had double concentrations of high speeds. One section had a cluster at the surface, midstream and another at the bed, close to the outer bank. In the second section, one cluster was at the surface close to the outer bank and the other was near the bed midstream, confirming the action of helical flow in the meander. The mapping showed horizontal gradients of speed just as clearly as vertical and oblique gradients, especially where the <b>talweg</b> was close to the outer bank...|$|E

40|$|Gravel-bed rivers {{featuring}} a near dynamic equilibrium state usually display a good correspondence between geomorphological and riparian community gradients, whereas long-term human alterations may disrupt these patterns. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the distribution of woody riparian vegetation on three geomorphic units - floodplains, bars, islands along the Piave River, a gravel-bed river located in Northern Italy suffering from various degrees of human pressure and disturbances. A total of 214 plots (4  4 m) along three cross-sections in each of two sub-reaches of the river were surveyed in order to identify the different morphological units, dendrological characteristics of standing plants and species composition. Three riparian woody communities, with decreasing woody species richness and tree size, were identified by cluster analysis: Alnion incanae (n= 58), Salicion eleagni (n= 52) and Rhamno-Prunetea (n= 27). The first was significantly associated with floodplains and the others with bars. No community showed a relatively stronger association with islands. Linear mixed models showed that the three geomorphic units significantly differed in mean elevation, fine sediment depth and geomorphic persistence, but not all Tukey contrasts were significant and absolute differences in mean elevation above <b>talweg</b> were quite small (< 25 cm). Moreover, the three woody communities were not always related to corresponding geomorphological gradients, which reflected the river's complex history of channel adjustments. Most notably, mean grain size did not differ between either geomorphic or vegetation units. This study therefore indicates that riparian woody vegetation along altered gravel-bed rivers may differ substantially from that characterising near-equilibrium river systems...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe fractal {{approach}} {{is often used}} to characterize natural objects. Numerous studies have focused on fractal analysis of river networks in particular. However, only few papers discuss the estimation methods and the uncertainty of the main fractal indicator, the fractal dimension. Firstly, the distinction between infinite mathematical fractal and nature fractal should be taken into account to estimate fractal dimension. Moreover, the networks are most of the time integrated in GIS database and represented by vector object. This type of representation possesses its own properties and we think that the impact on fractal measure should be evaluated. In this context, the work we propose aims at testing the robustness of different fractal dimension estimators for the characterization of vector <b>talweg</b> networks. We focus on the two most popular estimators: a classical estimator for river networks, based on a topological approach with the Horton-Strahler ratios, and the box-counting dimension, based on a geometric approach. A third estimator, the less known correlation dimension, also based on a geometric approach, offers interesting possibility for calculating a stable fractal indicator, in particular {{in the case of a}} reduced number of stream-segments. These methods are applied on both virtual (such as Scheidegger network), and actual vector networks. The actual case is a network extracted from a high resolution DTM of the Draix badlands in the French Alps. Three main methodological results can be highlighted: 1 - the study of virtual network contributes to the assessment of the estimators relevance, according to the network branching structure; 2 - an empirical fractal domain must be determined on the Log-Log curve with an objective method to estimate fractal dimensions that can be compared; 3 - the observation of uncertainty of the fractal dimension is necessary for any valid comparison...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to providing new tools and methods for studying the trend to equilibrium of gradient flows in metric spaces in the entropy and metric sense, to establish decay rates, finite time of extinction, and to characterize Lyapunov stable equilibrium points. More precisely, our main results are. - Introduction of a gradient inequality in the metric space framework, which in the Euclidean space is due to Łojasiewicz [Éditions du C. N. R. S., 87 - 89, Paris, 1963] and Kurdyka [Ann. Inst. Fourier, 48 (3), 769 - 783, 1998]. - Establish trend to equilibrium in the entropy and metric sense of gradient flows generated by a functional satisfying a Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality in a neighborhood of an equilibrium point of the functional. - Sufficient conditions are given implying decay rates and finite time of extinction of gradient flows. - Constructions of a <b>talweg</b> curves in metric spaces are given yielding the validity of a Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality. - Characterise Lyapunov stable equilibrium points of energy functionals satisfying a Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality near such points. - Characterisation of the entropy-entropy production inequality with the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality near equilibrium points of a functional. As an application of these results, the following results are established. - New upper bounds on the extinction time of gradient flows associated with the total variational flow. - If the metric space is the p-Wasserstein space, then new HWI-, Talagrand-, and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities are obtained for functionals associated with nonlinear diffusion problems modeling drift, potential and interaction phenomena. It is shown that these inequalities are equivalent to the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality and so, imply trend to equilibrium of the gradient flows with decay rates or arrive in finite time.

40|$|The {{study area}} {{comprises}} the western {{portion of the}} Marília Plateau, State of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The geological substrate encompasses Cretaceous sedimentary rocks of the Bauru Group and local Neocenozoic units like colluvium aprons, fluvial terrace deposits, in situ regoliths, and modern alluvial deposits. In a geomorphologic sense, the study area might be characterized as showing two main pediplanes, viz. P 1 Surface (upper) and P 2 Surface (lower), both surfaces are presently under dissecation processes. After the 1920 's {{the expansion of the}} railroad system fostered the removal of the natural vegetation, which in turn was followed by the introduction of coffee, peanut, corn and cotton crops. This intense exploitation was conducted without respect to the soil carrying capacity and its natural susceptibility to erosional processes, including an aggressive form known as voçoroca. As a result, the study shows that the most susceptible material includes colluvium aprons, in situ regoliths, and colluvium-alluvium or alluvium deposits. The most critical situation is in the P 2 Surface context, {{near the bottom of the}} Marília Plateau scarpment, where surface runoff can be very strong. Another point of active erosion is represented by the exposed walls of gullies and voçorocas, mainly in fluvial reaches subjected to <b>talweg</b> lowering. In a general sense, this study shows current evidence of erosional stability due to the ìntroduction of pastures as a predominant type of land occupation and to a series of erosion control procedures. Among these actions are terrace implantation, construction of small pits for runoff control, natural or induced reforestation by land owners. Despite these efforts, some erosion points remain chiefly in steeper country roads and trail stretches, in areas of concentration of cattle tracks (e. g., near cattle ponds), gullies or voçorocas exposed walls, and badly planned urbanization. The permanence of these erosion points demonstrates the necessity of a continuous monitoring of surface dynamics as well as a rapid and effective intervining measures of erosion and/or silting control...|$|E
