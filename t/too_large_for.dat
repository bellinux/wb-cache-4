5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Baith Israel {{merged with}} Degraw Street's Talmud Torah Anshei Emes Synagogue, a growing {{congregation}} {{that had become}} <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the row house in which it held services. Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary.|$|E

Although the game's core gameplay mechanics, story and narrative are unchanged in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports, some features (such as the Nemesis system) are less complex than the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. According to the game's developer, the Nemesis system was <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> older consoles.|$|E

5|$|Once <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> Sanders to manage, Kentucky Fried Chicken grew to {{overwhelm}} John Y. Brown as well. In July 1971, Brown sold {{the company to}} the Connecticut-based Heublein, a packaged food and drinks corporation, for US$285 million (around US$1.6 billion in 2013). Brown personally gained around $35 million from the sale. Reuters opined that the takeover probably saved the company from disaster. Heublein planned to increase KFC's volume with its sales and marketing expertise.|$|E
5|$|The Grumman XTSF was a {{proposed}} twin-engine torpedo scout aircraft, designed by Grumman for the United States Navy {{towards the end}} of World War II. Based on the design of the Grumman F7F Tigercat fighter, enlarged and {{with the addition of a}} bomb bay, the XTSF was deemed <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> carrier operations, and the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built. Instead, the Navy chose to order the single-engine XTB3F, which became the successful AF Guardian.|$|E

Working with the Avon Wildlife Trust, Somerset Wildlife Trust and other environmental groups, Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants, and created a venue for visitors.|$|E

50|$|Gates of Prayer {{was criticized}} {{as being a}} {{non-cohesive}} collection of prayers, resulting in a prayer book that was <b>too</b> <b>large,</b> and <b>for</b> its retention of masculine pronouns.

5|$|This form of Cotes's spirals {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the two Poinsot's spirals (Figure 8). The possible values of λ range from zero to infinity, which {{corresponds to}} values of μ greater than the positive number L12/m. Thus, Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse-cube central forces, and applies in the case that L is not <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the given μ.|$|E
5|$|A mockup of the cockpit, center {{fuselage}} and wing {{center section}} was built and was inspected by the BuAer {{in the fall}} 1944. However, the contract for the prototype XTSF-1s was terminated in January 1945. This was due {{to a variety of}} factors, including the Navy's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat, the F7F, and the F8F Bearcat, that the XTSF-1 would be <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> practical operations from escort carriers, and because it was believed the Grumman G-70, to be built as the XTB3F, was a better prospect. In addition, the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers, further prejudicing the Navy against the design.|$|E
5|$|Hightail {{was founded}} as YouSendIt Inc. in 2004 by three cofounders: Ranjith Kumaram, Amir Shaikh and Khalid Shaikh. In its early years, Amir pursued {{advertising}} revenues, Jimmy Vienneau managed business development, Francis Wu created the graphic design including the logo, while Kumaran {{focused on the}} user experience and Khalid did technical work. By May 2004, the company had 300,000 users and was growing 30 percent each month. That September, Cambrian Ventures invested $250,000. At first, YouSendIt was mainly used to send large files, such as photos or audio files, which were <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the file-size limits set by email providers at the time.|$|E

5|$|In his new positions, Khrushchev {{continued}} his kolkhoz consolidation scheme, which decreased {{the number of}} collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in Pravda in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a person with a disability as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E
5|$|Saints Row 2 is {{a mobile}} tie-in action game {{developed}} by G5 Entertainment {{and published by}} THQ Wireless to accompany the Saints Row 2 console game. It was released in October 2008. The game follows {{the story of the}} series where the player returns from jail and fights to protect and expand his gang's territory. The player can steal, carjack, mug, shoot, stab, and kill computer players. There are special minigames for robbing, stealing, and carjacking. Completing missions earns money to be spent towards replenished supplies and player upgrades. Reviewers contended that the game was <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the small screen, which exacerbated difficult driving controls.|$|E

The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002, and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine. At the time, two experts working on the stained glass restoration called it the largest such project that had ever been undertaken in the United States; <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it would be necessary to form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Park {{was a major}} {{supplier}} of materiel in the First and Second World Wars, producing the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. At its peak in 1945, an estimated 75,000workers were employed in the park. That number began to decline in the 1960s as companies closed in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. By 1967 employment had fallen to 50,000, and the decline continued throughout the 1970s. The new generation of container ships was <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the Manchester Ship Canal, {{which led to a}} further decline in Trafford Park's fortunes. The workforce had fallen to 15,000 by 1976, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared from the park.|$|E

Nevertheless, it failed to find a buyer at the Summer Exhibition, and was instead bought by fellow artist John Martin. The painting proved <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold {{it on to the}} Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was built}} as a {{replacement}} for Grant Park's outdoor concert facilities, larger annual events such as the Chicago Blues and Chicago Jazz Festivals and Taste of Chicago are <b>too</b> <b>large</b> <b>for</b> Jay Pritzker Pavilion and continue to be held in and around Petrillo Music Shell. The pavilion has hosted smaller festivals, such as the Chicago Gospel Music Festival, since 2005. Public opinion has been in favor of moving some of the smaller Blues and Jazz festival events to the pavilion, with its better, more modern acoustics. By 2009, as the city grappled with a budget deficit, it considered realigning parts of the larger festivals and made definite plans to move some of the smaller ones to the more modern venue.|$|E
