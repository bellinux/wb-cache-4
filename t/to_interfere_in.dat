5|$|Because General Maurice Sarrail had {{demonstrated}} a tendency <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> politics, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau relieved {{him of his}} command in December 1917. There was a strong French influence in Korçë even after the Autonomous Republic ceased to exist. The Albanian National Lyceum remained active until 1939; a French Military Cemetery was built and can still {{be seen in the}} city.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1190s, the Georgian {{government}} began <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> {{the affairs of}} the Ildenizids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Ildenizid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Ildenizids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.|$|E
5|$|Stationed off Haiti was the British frigate HMS Southampton under Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo, {{tasked with}} observing the {{political}} situation but with orders not <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the intermittent conflict between Christophe and Pétion. Yeo's orders did not include Borgella's ships and Yeo reasoned that the Haitian flagship, the large frigate Heureuse Réunion (recently renamed from Améthyste and often reported under its former name), presented {{a serious threat to}} international trade in the region.|$|E

5|$|The House of Wangchuck {{currently}} {{rules the}} country. This monarchy {{was established in}} 1907. The same year, Punakha Dzong {{was the site of}} the coronation of Ugyen Wangchuck (or Deb Nagpo) as the first Druk Gyalpo. At that time, Punakha was the capital of Bhutan. Three years later, a treaty was signed at Punakha whereby the British agreed not <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser {{established}} a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and {{the dissolution of}} all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E
5|$|Charuseela {{returns to}} Devarakota and assumes that Harsha {{is trying to}} impress her family with the {{intention}} of marrying her. Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is going to take over all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the land will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha confronts them and warns them not <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> his work of developing the village.|$|E
25|$|Later in the year, Zach and Kendall {{start to}} have problems. These issues are mostly due <b>to</b> Kendall <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> {{the affairs of}} Ryan, Annie Lavery, Greenlee, Aidan, and Josh Madden (Kendall's thought to be aborted half-brother).|$|R
25|$|Islam is {{the largest}} and the {{official}} state religion of the UAE. The government follows a policy of tolerance toward other religions and rarely <b>interferes</b> <b>in</b> the activities of non-Muslims. By the same token, non-Muslims are expected <b>to</b> avoid <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> Islamic religious matters or the Islamic upbringing of Muslims.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Birch {{came out}} of {{retirement}} and returned to WWE at the SmackDown tapings on April 20, where he lost to Shelton Benjamin in a dark match. On April 25 at Extreme Rules, he reappeared on television as a masked member of CM Punk's The Straight Edge Society stable and interfered in Punk's match with Rey Mysterio, helping him pick up the win. Birch continued <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Punk's matches during the following months, before being unmasked by Big Show on the July 23 episode of SmackDown. This led to a handicap match at SummerSlam where Big Show defeated the entire Society. In early September {{it was reported that}} Mercury had undergone surgery on a torn pectoral muscle.|$|E
5|$|In early 1813, Ernest was {{involved}} in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown {{to be one of}} three trustees who were able to dictate who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, German {{forces were}} {{defeated}} in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences. In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner. Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk. Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric Flair faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} Flair on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through {{the table with a}} Splash. Near the end of the match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2011, Hardy {{made his}} debut for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at the Genesis pay-per-view, {{as part of}} the heel stable Immortal. He was the {{surprise}} opponent for Rob Van Dam, and defeated him to prevent Van Dam from receiving a match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, held by Hardy's brother Jeff. In the main event, Hardy attempted <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Jeff's World Heavyweight Championship match with Mr. Anderson, but was stopped by Van Dam, which led to Jeff losing both the match and the championship. On the January 13 episode of Impact!, the Hardy Boyz reunited to defeat Anderson and Van Dam in a tag team match, following interference from Beer Money, Inc.. Two weeks later, Hardy suffered his first loss in TNA when he was defeated by Mr. Anderson. On February 13 at Against All Odds, Rob Van Dam defeated Hardy in a rematch.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Bahraini {{authorities}} summoned the Lebanese ambassador in Bahrain {{to file a}} complaint against a conference held by Bahrain Rebellion Movement in Beirut. In the conference, opposition activists called for civil disobedience and mass protests, the BNA reported. A number of Bahraini opposition politicians and human rights activists have based their activities in Beirut where they enjoy more freedom. The BNA added that the Lebanese ambassador said his government was not supportive of the conference and {{that they did not}} wish <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Bahraini internal affairs. A day earlier, the salafist Al Asalah Islamic Society had criticized Lebanon for hosting the conference.|$|E
50|$|Shane Helms got {{his title}} {{shot at the}} WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Chavo Guerrero, Jr. at the Greed pay-per-view, where he {{defeated}} Guerrero to win the title. Totally Buffed received their title shot at the WCW World Tag Team Championship against Chuck Palumbo and Sean O'Haire at the event but failed to win the title. Diamond Dallas Page got a title shot for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Scott Steiner due <b>to</b> <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> Steiner's title match against Nash at SuperBrawl Revenge. Steiner defeated Page to retain the title in a falls count anywhere match.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty stipulated {{the return}} of Azov to the Ottomans, Taganrog and several Russian fortresses were to be demolished, and the Tsar pledged <b>to</b> stop <b>interfering</b> <b>in</b> {{the affairs of the}} Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which the Russians {{increasingly}} saw as under their sphere of influence.|$|R
50|$|Sigismund was {{captured}} during the battle, {{but as the}} Polish-Lithuanian crowned head of state, {{allowed to return to}} the commonwealth. He'd engendered the civil war by violating his pledge <b>to</b> not <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> religious matters in Sweden, nor to further the Catholic cause in Sweden.|$|R
5|$|Punk {{then turned}} his sights to Heyman's other client, Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel. On September 15, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a No Disqualication, Handicap {{elimination}} match at Night of Champions, {{in which he}} made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left. In the process of attacking Heyman, Ryback attacked Punk and placed Heyman on top of Punk for the pinfall. A month later, at Battleground, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a low blow, while the referee was distracted by Heyman attempting <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> the match. On October 14, Punk defeated Axel in a Beat the Clock challenge match to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one Handicap match in the Hell in a Cell also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Ahhiyawa in western Anatolia is mentioned in various Hittite accounts from c. 1400 to c. 1220 BC. Ahhiyawa is generally {{accepted as a}} Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece (Achaeans in Homeric Greek), but a precise geographical {{definition of the term}} cannot be drawn from the texts. During this time, the kings of Ahhiyawa were evidently capable of dealing with their Hittite counterparts both on a diplomatic and military level. Moreover, Ahhiyawan activity was <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Anatolian affairs, with the support of anti-Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers, which the Ahhiyawan king used as agents for the extension of his influence.|$|E
5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse <b>to</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>in</b> Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Muhammad Hassan (managed by Daivari). During Hassan's entrance, men in masks {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} ring to represent his Arabic culture. The masked men proceeded <b>to</b> <b>interfered</b> <b>in</b> the match, but Undertaker retaliated and removed all of the masked men from the ring. Midway through the match, Undertaker attempted to use a Tombstone piledriver on Hassan, but Hassan escaped the move and attempted a Clothesline. The Undertaker countered by chokeslamming Hassan and scored the pinfall on Hassan to win the match. Following this, Undertaker executed a Last Ride through the stage floor on Hassan, writing him out of storylines.|$|R
