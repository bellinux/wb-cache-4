40|$|Abstract — Proper {{matching}} of {{tractors and}} implements {{is crucial for}} maintaining high operational efficiency on the farm. An object-oriented program in Visual C++ was developed to predict the performance of tractor-implement system. The Brixius Model and ASAE Standards D 497. 5 were used to predict the tractor performance and implement draft respectively. A simulation subroutine in the program selects the optimum field speed that matches the pull provided by a tractor with the Draft requirement of an implement and displays some performance parameters of the tractor-implement system. Tractor and implement performance parameters such as field speed, drawbar pull, drawbar power, <b>total</b> implement <b>draft,</b> <b>field</b> capacity, and actual operating hours are predicted for the selected tractorimplement system. The program is appropriate for farm machinery management, educational and research purposes. It is user-friendly and could be run on Windows desktop with or without Visual C++ environment. The databases of the tractors and implements could be edited and/or updated to suit the required task of the user.

40|$|By using {{analytical}} correlations derived as {{a result}} of theoretical research, a computer algorithm has been worked out for simulating the functions of the plough body and the forces exerted by soil upon the operating parts, as well as its draft resistance. These correlations allow to determine the draft resistance of the plough depending on the parameters of its body, as well as to evaluate the impact of the physical and mechanical properties of soil, such as friction upon it. The greatest influence upon the draft resistance is exerted by soil hardness, density and slip resistance along the surfaces of the operating parts. The latter is also affected by soil adhesion, which particularly manifests itself in wet clay soils at lower temperatures. It has been clarified that the friction resistance constitutes 46 – 62 % of the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> resistance of the plough body. The main ways of lowering the friction resistance and the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> resistance of the plough are the introduction of a more rational design of its body having optimum parameters, decreasing the resistance of the share-mouldboard surface and the values of reactions of the supporting surfaces, as well as the application of antifriction materials and better modes of joining with tractors...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, as more farm power is being demanded on farms, due to {{increased}} farm sizes and operating speeds, larger and heavier farm machines are deployed in various farming operations. Their cumulative negative effects have become more apparent with increased incidences of soil compaction problems. This has forced many farmers to practice deep tilling, using subsoilers to break up compacted subsoil layers. In some maize growing regions of South Africa, conventional subsoilers are used in a tandem configuration. The farmers believe {{that the use of}} subsoilers in this mode reduces the draft force per unit area tilled. This probably happens because the critical depth for the rear subsoiler is increased beyond its working depth of 600 mm. Operating in this mode necessitated this study, with the ultimate goal of testing an appropriate existing force model for a single tine in predicting the force requirements of the front subsoiler in a tandem configuration. Secondly, to develop an alternative model for the rear subsoiler based on the three-dimensional failed soil-profile and to determine the relative position of the front subsoiler at which energy utilization is optimized. To develop the proposed model, an analytical approach based on limit equilibrium analysis was used and a Matlab-based computer program was coded to solve it. Its verification was conducted through field experiments in sandy clay loam soil. The experiments consisted of a continuous measurement of the horizontal and vertical forces acting on each subsoiler by a two-dimensional force transducer system. At the same time, the three-dimensional and thus the cross-sectional areas of the disturbed soil-profiles at different sections were measured, as well as the soil characteristics. A manual method employing a pin-profile meter was used to measure the vertical cross-sectional areas of the failed soil-profiles at 100 mm intervals. Further more, a technique using an automatic penetrometer and a computer program was developed to identify and map the three-dimensional failed soil-profiles. This technique indicated that the subsoiler failed the soil beyond its maximum operating depth and width. The results also indicated that the soil-failure pattern at close spacing is in phase at both subsoilers, leading to reduced <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force requirements. At a wider spacing, the soil-failure pattern was out of phase, thus resulting in increased <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force requirements. At the same time, the cross-sectional area tilled per unit draft force increased with increased spacing. This was because the failed maximum cross-sectional area increased in size faster than the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> force as the spacing was increased. The proposed model verification results show that the predicted and recorded forces at the rear subsoiler correlated reasonably well at a wider spacing. When the front subsoiler was shallow working and close to the rear subsoiler, the model under- predicted the measured forces on the rear subsoiler, whilst the Swick-Perumpral model over predicted the applied forces to the front subsoiler and this was generally the case at wider spacings. Furthermore the efficiency of the subsoilers was maximized when the longitudinal spacing was such that it allowed the soil failed by the front subsoiler to stabilize before the rear subsoiler reached it. The maximum cross-sectional area failed per unit draft force was recorded when the depth of the front subsoiler was equal to about 80 % of the rear subsoiler-operating depth. The knowledge contributed by this research will not only facilitate qualitative field operations and optimize energy use, but also promote better management decisions.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} influence of the drawing process of TWIP steel wires on their mechanical properties and the structure changes. Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment of steel containing 29. 4 % manganese and little amount of carbon (0. 0049 %C) allows to obtain TWIP effect, and the austenitic structure for this type of steel was realized. In order to investigate the structure changes, the optical microscopy was used. Mechanical properties were determined by the compression test and drawing process. Findings: The analyses of changes of mechanical properties and the structure after particular drawings stages was carried out. At the <b>total</b> <b>draft</b> of 93. 4 % the value of drawing stress was 1060 MPa, however further deformations of the wire brought relation Rm/R 0. 2 to be above 1. 6. Research limitations/implications: Continuation of the investigations with the use of transmission electron microscopy makes it possible to identify all phases that appear in this steel. Practical implications: Drawn products characterized by high strength properties together with good plasticity might be used for production of connecting elements because they can absorb large quantity of energy. Originality/value: For the first time there were obtained so high hardening level as well as so high plasticity in the drawing process...|$|R
