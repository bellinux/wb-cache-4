No shooter had significantly more runs than would be expected by chance. About half of the shooters (12 of 23 = 52%) had fewer runs than expected, and about half (11 of 23 = 48%) had more runs than expected. The researchers also compared the shooters hits and misses. The data were more in accordance with chance than the hot hand. Through their analysis of the data the conclusion was drawn that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> supported the hot hand hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In America, as had {{happened}} with H.M.S. Pinafore, the first productions were unauthorised, but once D'Oyly Carte's American production opened in August 1885, {{it was a}} success, earning record profits, and Carte formed several companies to tour the show in North America. Burlesque and parody productions, including political parodies, were mounted. About 150 unauthorised versions cropped up, and, as had {{been the case with}} Pinafore, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> Carte or Gilbert and Sullivan could do about it, since there was no copyright treaty at the time. In Australia, The Mikados first authorised performance was on 14 November 1885 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by J. C. Williamson. During 1886, Carte was touring five Mikado companies in North America.|$|E
25|$|The Athletics' {{victory over}} the New York Mets in the 1973 Series was marred by Finley's antics. Finley forced Mike Andrews to sign a false {{affidavit}} saying he was injured after the reserve second baseman committed two consecutive errors in the 12th inning of the A's Game Two loss to the Mets. When other team members, manager Dick Williams, and virtually the entire viewing public rallied to Andrews' defense, Kuhn forced Finley to back down. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> said the A's had to play Andrews. Andrews entered Game 4 {{in the eighth inning}} as a pinch-hitter to a standing ovation from sympathetic Mets fans. He promptly grounded out, and Finley ordered him benched {{for the remainder of the}} Series. Andrews never played another major league game. As it was, the incident allowed the Mets, a team that went but 82–79 during the regular season, to go seven games before losing to a superior team. Williams was so disgusted by the affair that he resigned after the Series. Finley retaliated by vetoing Williams' attempt to become manager of the Yankees. Finley claimed that since Williams still owed Oakland the last year of his contract, he could not manage anywhere else. Finley relented later in 1974 and allowed Williams to take over as manager of the California Angels.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1797, however, when [...] "notoriously scurrilous journalist" [...] James T. Callender {{published}} A History of the United States for the Year 1796, it contained accusations of James Reynolds being an agent of Hamilton, using documents from the confrontation of December 15, 1792. On July 5, 1797, Hamilton wrote to Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable asking them to confirm that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> would damage the perception of his integrity while Secretary of Treasury. All complied with Hamilton's request but Monroe, and after several rounds of argument, the two almost resorted to a duel. When Hamilton did not obtain an explicit response from Monroe, he published a 100-page booklet, later usually {{referred to as the}} Reynolds Pamphlet, in order to preserve his public reputation, and discussed the affair in exquisite detail. His wife Elizabeth eventually forgave him, but not Monroe. Though he faced ridicule from the Democratic-Republican faction, he maintained his availability for public service.|$|E
500|$|Spinosaurus {{appeared}} in the 2001 film Jurassic Park III, replacing Tyrannosaurus as the main antagonist. The film's consulting paleontologist John R. Horner was quoted as saying: [...] "If we base the ferocious factor {{on the length of}} the animal, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> ever lived on this planet that could match this creature [...] Also my hypothesis is that T-rex was actually a scavenger rather than a killer. Spinosaurus was really the predatory animal." [...] (He has since retracted the statement about T. Rex being a scavenger.) [...] In the film, Spinosaurus was portrayed as larger and more powerful than Tyrannosaurus: in a scene depicting a battle between the two resurrected predators, Spinosaurus emerges victorious by biting the tyrannosaur's neck. In the fourth film Jurassic World, there is a nod to this fight where the T-Rex smashes through the skeleton of a Spinosaurus in the climatic fight {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E

I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

500|$|NSB {{stated that}} they would demand a {{discount}} from Adtranz. Following the incident, the trains {{would have to be}} in for maintenance examinations every , rather than every [...] With each exam costing NOK50,000, NSB stated that this represented an extra cost of NOK20 million per year. The contract between Adtranz and NSB states how often trains are to be maintained, and Adtranz holds a financial responsibility if the trains systematically need more maintenance than that. By 24 June, cracks had been found in two additional units. Similar cracks had occurred in the X2 trains, but after many years of operations. The same manufacturer had been used for the axles on both trains. In Sweden impurities in the steel, combined with undersized axles, were thought to be a cause, but replacements had caused the same issues. On 26 June, NSB stated that [...] in April they had discovered that not checking the whole axle was a weakness in the maintenance procedures, but that despite this, no new examinations had been done. The reason this was ignored, was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>that</b> indicated that this part of the axle represented a weak point.|$|E
