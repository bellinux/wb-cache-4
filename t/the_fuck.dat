From November 14 to November 23, 2013, Hopsin toured with Shady Records artist Yelawolf in promotion of Knock Madness on <b>The</b> <b>Fuck</b> It Tour.

On January 18, 2014, the tour moved to North America, starting in Santa Cruz, California. The leg of the tour ran through March 22, 2014.

5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What <b>The</b> <b>Fuck</b> Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title track}} and lead single [...] "Eazy-Duz-It", written by MC Ren, {{opens with a}} woman acclaiming Eazy-E's style. Eazy then {{interrupts}} saying [...] "Bitch shut <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> up, get <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> outta here." [...] This {{is followed by a}} bass line provided by Dr. Dre. Soon, Eazy begins to rap about himself and things that he does. The song declares that Eazy is a [...] "hardcore villain" [...] who collects money from his prostitutes, and feels great when his [...] "pockets are fat." [...] The chorus, repeated three times, states that he [...] "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several drugs.|$|E

500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{wasted no}} time in {{recording}} new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled Who <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Are Arctic Monkeys?. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – [...] "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play". The release of the EP Who <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Are Arctic Monkeys? just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, who have seen it as [...] "money-grabbing" [...] and [...] "cashing in on their success". The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the [...] "boredom" [...] of [...] "spending three years touring on one album".|$|E

Stephan Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "is an effective follow-up to their first two alt-metal landmarks." [...] Erlewine also said that the songs were [...] "vehicles for the metal grind". Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B–. Reviewer Jim Farber said that the lyrics [...] "provide a new blend of metal and remnants of alt-rock." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times said the album was [...] "choppy", and also said that lead singer Jonathan Davis was [...] "wrestling with self-hatred, violent impulses, parental execration, and a confused sexual identity..." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said that, although Korn [...] "deny they're metal", they [...] "nevertheless demonstrate that the essence of metal ... is self-obliterating volume and self-aggrandizing display." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, while saying that Korn [...] "have an ideal record for those long, black days when {{all you can do is}} say 'What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck!</b> What <b>the</b> <b>Fuck!</b> What the Fuck!' at bloody murder volume".
