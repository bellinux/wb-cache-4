The eggs closely {{resemble}} those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and lace monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E

5|$|Major André was {{captured}} near Tarrytown on Saturday, September 23 by three Westchester militiamen named John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart, and David Williams. The papers were found exposing the plot to capture West Point {{and sent to}} Gen. Washington, and Arnold's intentions came to light after Washington examined them. Meanwhile, André convinced <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Colonel John Jameson, to whom he was delivered, to send him back to Arnold at West Point. However, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, {{a member of the}} Culper Ring established under Washington's orders, insisted that Jameson order the prisoner to be intercepted and brought back. Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant who had been delivering André into Arnold's custody, but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of André's arrest.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of the Chinese counteroffensive, the PVA 120th Division first accidentally {{stumbled}} upon the US 9th Infantry Regiment on the northern bank of the Ch'ongch'on River. The surprise encounter between the two sides soon left the 9th Infantry Regiment with only three rifle companies combat effective. Unaware that the 1st Battalion of the US 23rd Infantry Regiment had pulled up behind the US 61st Field Artillery Battalion, four Sharp Sword Companies from the PVA 359th Regiment of the 120th Division proceeded to cross the river and attacked the US artillery positions. Although the 61st Battalion was routed by surprise, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment quickly knocked out two of <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Chinese companies. The surviving Chinese troops drifted eastward and occupied a hill named Chinaman's Hat, enabling the Chinese to overlook the entire 23rd Infantry Regiment's positions.|$|E
5|$|The Prometheus {{lands on}} the barren, mountainous surface near a large, {{artificial}} structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew {{to return to the}} ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.|$|E

5|$|Xiphias is next {{mentioned}} in the Battle of Kleidion in 1014, when Basil II was attempting to force the pass known as Kleidion or Kiava Longos, which the Bulgarians under their ruler Samuil had strongly fortified. Xiphias, still strategos of Philippopolis, suggested to the Emperor to bypass the Bulgarian positions and strike them from the rear. After Basil agreed, Xiphias led a picked infantry detachment over Mount Belasica, and on 29 July 1014, led his troops on a charge on <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Bulgarians, who panicked and broke before the unexpected attack. For this feat, which resulted {{in one of the}} most decisive victories in the long Bulgarian war, he was rewarded with promotion to the rank of patrikios. In early 1015, Xiphias, along with Constantine Diogenes, subdued the region of Moglena, which had rebelled against imperial rule. Towards the end of the same year he campaigned from Mosynopolis to the region of Triaditza (Sofia), razing its environs and capturing the fort of Boyana. Finally, in the last year of the Bulgarian war, in 1018, starting from Kastoria he subdued the remaining Bulgarian strongholds in the region of Servia.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the first}} and second falls, Barr began to mockingly perform jumping jacks in the ring, showing how little {{physical}} exertion it took to win the first fall. This was followed by Guerrero once again mocking the Mexican crowd by pretending to be swimming to infuriate the crowd. Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out the second fall as they had the first, locking up {{in the center of the}} ring. When Octagón entered the ring, Guerrero dropped to his knees, feigning an apology for a moment, before poking Octagón in the eye to gain the advantage. Later on, Hijo del Santo entered the ring and all four men ended up in the ring at the same time, until the tecnico team sent La Pareja del Terror to the floor, followed by a double Topé Suicida (Suicide dive headbutt) by Hijo del Santo and Octagón. Later in the match, Guerrero performed a Huracanrana with Hijo del Santo sitting on the top rope and gained a pinfall, leaving Octagón at a disadvantage in the second fall. Barr and Guerrero double-teamed Octagón, with Barr throwing Octagón up on the air, thinking Guerrero caught him for a move. Instead, Octagón rolled up Guerrero for the pinfall as Barr celebrated, mistakenly thinking Guerrero got the pinfall. Moments later, <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Barr was rolled up into Octagón's trademark submission hold La Escalera and was forced to submit, tying the match at one fall each.|$|E
5|$|Rain and fog {{were heavy}} {{throughout}} {{the morning of}} July 6, and visibility was limited for the emplaced troops. Just after daybreak, 13 North Korean T-34 tanks were spotted stopped at the bridge. Following them were two columns of infantry. The American forces originally believed {{that they might be}} survivors of Task Force Smith until they realized the forces were deploying in numbers too great, and began preparing to attack <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> North Koreans. The battalion's commander ordered mortar fire on the North Korean forces, causing them to disperse as the lead tank began firing on the positions of A Company, on a hill southwest of the road. Mortar fire destroyed a truck, but a round from a North Korean tank stunned the artillery observer and no one took his place in the confusion, ending the American mortar attack. North Korean forces immediately began advancing on A Company's position, but the company was not able to return fire effectively, with fewer than half of its soldiers using their weapons. For several minutes only squad and platoon leaders shot back {{while the rest of the}} soldiers hid in their foxholes. Within fifteen minutes, B Company was able to return fire effectively, and by this time the North Korean forces had advanced steadily toward 1st Battalion's position. Later examinations found many American soldiers' weapons were assembled incorrectly or were dirty or broken. The Americans had nothing with which to fight the tanks, and were unable to do anything to stop them.|$|E

5|$|The Puranas {{introduce}} {{themes that}} are echoed in later works, including the deception of <b>the</b> <b>unsuspecting</b> Ahalya by Indra's devious disguise as Gautama in his absence. The Padma Purana states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath, Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him. Ahalya, engrossed in worship, rejects him, considering it inappropriate {{to have sex}} {{at the cost of}} neglecting the gods. Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him. Finally Ahalya gives in, but Gautama learns of Indra's deception through his supernatural powers and returns to the ashram. A similar account is found in the Brahma Purana. At times, Indra {{takes the form of a}} cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions, as in the 18th-century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior-poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty. In other versions, he uses an accomplice, such as the moon-god Chandra, to distract Gautama. In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Ahalya comes to bathe in the Svarnadi (heavenly river) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her. Assuming Gautama's form, Indra has sex with her until they sink to the river bed in exhaustion. However, Gautama catches them in the act. Another version in the same Purana focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra. In this version, Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour, which is flatly refused by Ahalya. Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective.|$|E
