5|$|The {{schedule}} for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period {{as they had been}} awake since early morning.

5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be buried by the mudflows.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Dorchester around 790. According to a chronicler, the King's reeve {{assembled}} a few men and sped to meet them <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were merchants from another country. When he arrived at their location, he admonished them and instructed {{that they should be}} brought to the royal town. The Vikings then slaughtered him and his men.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General George Rogers Clark's {{invasion}} of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the Battle of Piqua on August 7. In October, when Boone was hunting with his brother Ned, Shawnees shot and killed Ned. Apparently <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had killed Daniel Boone, the Shawnees beheaded Ned and took the head home as a trophy. In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under Banastre Tarleton captured Boone and several other legislators near Charlottesville. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone's term, Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky unabated. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the Battle of Blue Licks, in which his son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Thi led {{a revolt}} against Diệm after {{lobbying}} by his Airborne Division deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông. Đông had become discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in military affairs. Diệm, who promoted officers {{on religion and}} loyalty, rather than skill, gave orders directly to individual commanders, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from becoming effective, lest they try to challenge his rule. Đông later stated his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country. Đông was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Triệu Hồng, and Hong's uncle, Hoang Co Thuy, members of the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which was an anti-communist political organization whose members had been marginalized by Diệm. The coup was organized {{with the help of}} some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam, known as Đại Việt) members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armored regiment, a marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The operation was launched on November 11 at 05:00. The coup was executed ineffectually; although the rebels captured the headquarters of the Joint General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to block the roads leading into Saigon and cut off loyalist reinforcements. Thi’s men also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to appeal for aid from loyal units. After taking the key military points, the paratroopers headed towards Independence Palace. At first, they did not attack, believing that Diệm would capitulate. Most of Thi's soldiers had been tricked into <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were attacking in order to save Diệm from a Presidential Guard mutiny. When the attack finally started, Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes when gunfire hit his bed, but he had arisen just a few minutes earlier. Despite their numerical advantage, the paratroopers' first assault was repelled by the loyalists. Thi and Dong held fire; they brought in reinforcements and attacked again, but the loyalists held firm. In the meantime, Thi's rebels had captured the national police offices, the studios of Radio Saigon and the Presidential Guard barracks. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest.|$|E

At the time, Quinn's purchase was welcomed by the other NHA owners, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would gain an operating franchise. Quinn's action gave Quinn and Livingstone three votes at NHA meetings. Livingstone still had the voting shares of the Ontarios and Torontos NHA franchises.|$|E

25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a stereotype about the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{at least}} some of the apparitional experiences reported by normal subjects appear to mimic normal perception to such a degree that the subject is deceived into <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> what <b>they</b> are experiencing actually is normal perception. [...] Similar close mimicking of normal perception is reported by some of the subjects of a lucid dream and out-of-body experiences, which therefore pose similar problems for the theory of direct realism.|$|R

He also quoted lines from The Art of War in his memorial to support his point on using deception to lure the enemy into a trap. Zhao Zi (趙咨), a Wei official, supported Man Chong's idea and managed to convince Cao Rui to approve it.|$|E
25|$|A truce {{was agreed}} between the rebels and the King (October/November 1536), {{during which time}} the King's {{position}} became much stronger. It is said this information reached Hull, and Hallam was expelled from the town by the emboldened Mayor (William Rogers), Alderman Eland, and a Mr. Knowles and other local people. However soon after (9 November) it was retaken, and garrisoned by forces under Robert Constable, with cannon installed in the harbour to prevent besieging from the sea. On 2 December the rebellion ended, with the King's pardon being proclaimed; the rebel forces dispersed, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had obtained the concessions they desired.|$|E

The size, scale and number of any headsails were a captain's personal choice, but were often be used to fool other pilots into <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being passed by a fishing boat, or as a signature to be recognised by approaching cargo boat captains.|$|E
50|$|Inquiry-based {{learning}} is fundamental {{for the development}} of higher order thinking skills.

The higher order <b>thinking</b> skills <b>that</b> students have the opportunity to develop during inquiry activities will assist in the critical <b>thinking</b> skills <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be able to transfer to other subjects.|$|R

The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were learning true aikijitsu.

The Persians, seeing them raising much dust and <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were the main Byzantine army, quickly gathered their forces and turned to meet them. Dorotheus then led his own men to attack the Persian rear. Despite their bad tactical position, facing attack from both front and rear, the Persian army resisted effectively, due to its greater numbers. At one point, however, a Byzantine commander, Florentius the Thracian, charged his unit into the Persian centre and managed to capture Mihr-Mihroe's battle standard. Although he was killed soon after, {{the loss of the}} flag caused fear among the Persian ranks. Their army began to retreat to their camp, abandoning the battlefield.|$|E
