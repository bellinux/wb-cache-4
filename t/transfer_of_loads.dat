The investigated methods for spatial coupling - the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> and deformations between the wetted surface and the strucutral model - are the method of Finite Interpolation Elements and two other, newly-implemented interpolation methods. All three are suitable for reduced structural models, and the geometries of the wetted surface and the structural model {{do not have to}} coincide. The aeroelastic simulation tool employed and the theoretical background of the spatial coupling schemes are outlined. Different measures for the quality of the spatial coupling are derived and applied to test cases of increasing complexity. The influence of user-defined coupling parameters on the deformation projection is assessed. Based on these results and on practical considerations, the available coupling methods are compared and conclusions are drawn regarding their applicabilit...|$|E

This kind of connection typically allows the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> within wooden elements by means of threaded steel rods glued with a structural adhesive. This paper relates to experimental and numerical investigations on small sized specimens, with the aim of providing a better knowledge about the elastic behavior according to temperature. Experimental results reveal that stiffness of bonded-in rods significantly decrease once the glass transition temperature of the adhesive is reached. However, the ultimate shear strength is constant and sudden failures occur in the wood close to the adhesive, whatever the temperature is. Then, an elastic finite element model allows the evolution of the Young modulus of the adhesive with temperature changes and also reveals the stress distribution along the glued-in depth during the elastic regime...|$|E

Although {{there has been a}} significant amount of research dedicated to characterizing and modeling the response of SMA alone, little research has focused on the transformation behavior of embedded SMAs. In the current work, photoelasticity was used to quantify the internal stresses induced by the actuation of a thin SMA ribbon in a polymer matrix. Through the use of a CCD camera and a frame grabber, photoelastic fringes were digitally recorded at discrete time increments. The stress contours were then analyzed quantitatively as a function of time. A numerical simulation of the embedded ribbon was also carried out using a coupled SMA constitutive model. The thermomechanical model accurately predicted the stress contours throughout the experiment...|$|E

ACL insufficiency causes deterioration of the physiologic roll-glide mechanism of the femorotibial joint and results in an increased anterior tibial translation {{as well as an}} increased internal tibial rotation. In the advent of muscular fatigue or deficient neuromuscular control, the patient will experience this combined anterior and rotatory instability as a subluxation of the femorotibial joint. According to the concept of primary and secondary restraints, failure of a primary restraint will cause recruitment of secondary structures in order to resist external forces and to stabilise joint motion. The increase in loads applied to secondary structures may render them more susceptible to degeneration or secondary failure [44, 45, 46]. Studies investigating the long-term functional outcome after conservative treatment of ACL ruptures, though not characterised by well designed prospective cohort studies, reported on the prevalence of radiographic osteoarthritis in 60 %- 90 % of subjects 10 – 15 years after injury [2, 3, 44, 47].|$|E

However, due to the complicated three-dimensional load transfer a very few or no numerical studies have been performed for a number of different fastening situations i. e. influence of the embedment depth, crack-width inftuence (fastening in cracked concrete), influence of the edge distance etc. Therefore, in the present study some results of the axisymmetric and three-dimensional numerical analysis of the headed studs embedded in plane concrete block are presented. Influence of different geometrical and material parameters have been studied employing finite element method and nonlocal microplane model. Comparison between experimental and numerical results indicate reasonable good agreement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{various parts}} of the world, the {{behavior}} of reinforced concrete moment resisting frame structure during recent earthquakes has highlighted the consequences of poor performance of reinforced concrete beam-column joints. Reinforced concrete beam-column joints in a reinforced concrete moment resisting frame are crucial zones for <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads,</b> effectively between the connecting beams and columns in the structure.

In the present work, effect of wire mesh orientation on the strength parameters of stressed exterior beam-column joints retrofitted with ferrocement jackets have been presented. The beam-column joints were stressed to ultimate load and then retrofitted with ferrocement jackets with two different wire mesh orientations. The results show a significant increase in ultimate load carrying capacity of retrofitted beam-column joints using ferrocement jackets with two layers of wire mesh with orientation at L-shape and at 45 degree to the longitudinal axis of the joint, varies from 6. 70 percent to 22. 57 percent along with the increase in the yield load and stiffness of the joint.

Frames together with the walls represent structural systems for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> in vertical and horizontal directions.

First, we designed a column to axial and shear loads in normal conditions of use. For the design we must take into account the effects of second-order theory. The appropriate design in case of fire.

Many of these individuals depend on artificial limbs to perform routine activities, but prosthetic suspensions using traditional socket technology can prove to be cumbersome and uncomfortable for a person with limb loss. Moreover, for those with high proximal amputations, limited residual limb length may prevent exoprosthesis attachment all together. Osseointegrated implant technology is a novel operative procedure which allows firm skeletal attachment between the host bone and an implant. Preliminary results in European amputees with osseointegrated implants have shown improved clinical outcomes by allowing direct <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> to the bone-implant interface.

The aim of the present effort {{was to investigate the}} effects of adding aerodynamic nonlinearity on the elastic behavior, in particular identifying the areas of nonlinearities and their importance. Care was taken to evaluate the Euler solver and the transfer of data between the aerodynamic and structural modules to identify sources of numerical error that may contribute to incorrect modeling of large deflections. It was found that sensitivities near the wing tip and leading edge required additional attention when clustering the computational aerodynamic grid near the surface. Further, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> from the Euler code to the structural code requires that the nonlinear drop of forces and moments be modeled as exactly as possible. Otherwise errors in the predicted geometric deformations of up to 10 % can occur. These are exacerbated for cases with large deflections and twist. For loosely coupled static aeroelastic simulations, the nonlinear aerodynamic predictions provided by the solution of the Euler equations are lower than the predictions of the vortex panel code. This results in lower predicted bending and twist by the higher-order aerodynamic code, indicating that the divergence and possibly flutter speeds predicted by lower-order aerodynamics may be overly conservative...|$|E

Dissecting cellular responses to mechanical forces is challenging, as even ‘‘simple’ ’ mechanical stimulation in vitro can cause multiple interdependent changes in the cellular microenvironment. These stimuli include solid deformation, fluid flows, altered physical and chemical surface features, and a complex <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>loads</b> between the various interacting components of a biological culture system. The active mechanical and biochemical responses of cells to these stimuli in generating internal forces, reorganizing cellular structures, and initiating intracellular signals that specify cell fate and remodel the surrounding environment further complicates cellular response to mechanical forces.

Microtechnology-based approaches to these challenges can yield key insights into the mechanical nature of cellular behaviour, by decoupling stimulation parameters; enabling multimodal control over combinations of stimuli; and increasing experimental throughput to systematically probe cellular response.
