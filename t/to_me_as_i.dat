I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and it occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{was in the room}} as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered what he would have thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{thought that}} the first Next Generation film, Star Trek Generations, was too much like a {{television}} episode but thought that his character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, was redefined as a [...] "movie hero" [...] in [...] He was concerned that in the new film, the character would return to that seen in the television series. Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E

6000|$|When {{there was}} a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so strange <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was walking home, to think that Dora was at home! It was such a {{wonderful}} thing, at first, to have her coming softly down to talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> ate my supper.
