The 5 W task seeks {{to extract the}} semantic information of nouns in a natural language sentence by distilling it into {{the answers to the}} 5 W questions: Who, What, When, Where and Why. As Bengali is a resource constraint language, the building of annotated gold standard corpus and acquisition of linguistics tools for features extraction are described in this paper.

40|$|This {{demonstration}} paper {{presents a}} novel content-based music search system that accepts a query containing multiple tags with multiple levels of preference (denoted as an MTML query) to search music from an untagged music database. We select {{a limited number}} of most frequently used music tags to form the tag space and design an interface for users to input queries by operating the scroll bars. To effect MTML content-based music retrieval, we introduce a tagbased music aspect model that jointly models the auditory features and <b>tag</b> <b>labels</b> of a song. Two indexing methods and their corresponding matching methods, namely pseudo song-based matching and tag affinity-based matching, are incorporated into the pre-learned tag-based music aspect model. The content-based music search system is implemented on the MajorMiner dataset, which consists of 2, 472 10 -second music clips and their associated human <b>labeled</b> <b>tags</b> crawled from the MajorMiner website. The MTML query interface contains 36 top tags used in the dataset. We randomly select 1, 648 music clips with their <b>tag</b> <b>labels</b> for training the tag-based music aspect model and 824 clips without using their <b>tag</b> <b>labels</b> for building the untagged music database for content-based retrieval. � 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} content-based automated tag learning. In particular, we address semantic variations (sub-tags) of the tag. Each video in the training set {{is assumed to be}} associated with a sub-tag label, and we treat this sub-tag label as latent information. A latent learning framework based on LogitBoost is proposed, which jointly considers both the <b>tag</b> <b>label</b> and the latent sub-tag label. The latent sub-tag information is exploited in our framework to assist the learning of our end goal, i. e., tag prediction. We use the cowatch information to initialize the learning process. In experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves significantly better results over baselines on a large-scale testing video set which contains about 50 million YouTube videos...|$|E
40|$|Visual Recognition is {{a central}} problem in {{computer}} vision, and it has numerous potential applications in many dierent elds, such as robotics, human computer interaction, and entertainment. In this dissertation, we propose two discriminative latent variable models for handling challenging visual recognition problems. In particular, we use latent variables to capture and model various prior knowledge in the training data. In the rst model, we {{address the problem of}} recognizing human actions from still images. We jointly consider both poses and actions in a unied framework, and treat human poses as latent variables. The learning of this model follows the framework of latent SVM. Secondly, we propose another latent variable model {{to address the problem of}} automated tag learning on YouTube videos. In particular, we address the semantic variations (sub-tags) of the videos which have the same tag. In the model, each video is assumed to be associated with a sub-tag label, and we treat this sub-tag label as latent information. This model is trained using a latent learning framework based on LogitBoost, which jointly considers both the latent sub-tag label and the <b>tag</b> <b>label.</b> Moreover, we propose a novel discriminative latent learning framework, kernel latent SVM, which combines the benet of latent SVM and kernel methods. The framework of kernel latent SVM is general enough to be applied in many applications of visual recognition. It is also able to handle complex latent variables with interdependent structures using composite kernels...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of RFID tags in different applications {{is important in}} order to gain greater functionality in products. Upon packaging, box tracking in logistics or in the supply chain can easily be achieved [1]. High manufacturing costs have led to the search for alternative manufacturing methods at an ultra-low cost and various printing processes have been considered such as inkjet, gravure, flexo, offset and screen printing. Currently, investigations are focused on the use of these printing technologies for the mass production of RFID directly on different printing materials such as papers, cardboards and foils [2 – 12]. This paper is an upgrade of our preliminary research [13] focused on antenna design and optimization of printing conditions. The analysis of the readability of UHF RFID tags, which were printed on real pharmaceutical packaging (of tablets) and on ID cards with printed and multi-layered laminated plastic cards were done. Two different antenna designs were printed. The first one on a packaging box and the second one on a foil layer which was then laminated with seven different foil layers. For printing thermal drying silver conductive printing ink was used. The NXP plastic strap chips were integrated with printed antennas using conductive glue. We found that printed antennas of UHF RFID tags and inline chip integration can swap the RFID <b>tag</b> <b>label</b> on packaging and RFID tag inlays in ID cards with printed ones. Preliminary results are promising, but to achieve better performance significant improvements have {{to be made in the}} near future...|$|E

40|$|I kid you not. This {{is a time}} in Pacific {{regional}} history {{where as}} a middle-aged Tongan woman with European, Maori, and Samoan ancestries who {{was born and raised}} in New Zealand, I teach students taking my undergraduate papers how not to go about making stereotypical assumptions. The students in my classes are mostly Maori and Pakeha (white, European) New Zealanders. They learn to interrogate typecasts produced by state policy, media, and academia classifying the suburbs of South Auckland as overcrowded with brown people, meaning Pacific Islanders; overburdened by non-communicable diseases, like obesity and diabetes; and overdone in dismal youth statistics for crime and high school drop-outs. And then some well-meaning but incredibly uninformed staff members at the university where I am a senior lecturer have a bright idea to give away portions of roast pig on a spit to Pacific Islanders at the South Auckland campus open day. Who asked the university to give us free roast pig? Who asked us if this is what we want from a university that was planted out South in 2010 to sell degrees to a South Auckland market predicted to grow to half a million people, largely young people, in the next two decades? (AUT University, 2014). Who makes decisions about what gets dished up to Pacific Islanders in South Auckland, compared to what their hopes might be for university education prospects? To rephrase Julie Landsman’s essay, how about “confronting the racism of low expectations” that frames and bounds Pacific Islanders in South Auckland when a New Zealand university of predominantly Palangi (white, European) lecturers and researchers on academic staff contemplate “closing achievement gaps?” (Landsman, 2004). Tackling “the soft bigotry of low expectations” set upon Pacific Islanders getting into and through the university system has prompted discussion around introducing two sets of ideas at Auckland University of Technology (The Patriot Post, 2014). First, a summer school foundation course for literacy and numeracy on the South campus, recruiting Pacific Islander school leavers wanting to go on to study Bachelor’s degrees. Previously, the University of Auckland had provided bridging paths designed for young Pacific peoples to step up to degree programmes (Anae et al, 2002). Second, the possibility of performing arts undergraduate papers recognising a diverse and youthful ethnoscape party to an Auckland context of theatre, drama, dance, music, Maori and Pacific cultural performance, storytelling, and slam poetry (Appadurai, 1996). Although this discussion is in its infancy and has not been feasibility scoped or formally initiated in the university system, it is a suggestion worth considering here. My inquiry is frank: Why conflate performance and South Auckland Pacific Islanders? Does this not lend to a clichéd mould that supposes young Pacific Islanders growing up in the ill-famed suburbs of the poor South are naturally gifted at singing, dancing, and performing theatrics? This is a characterisation fitted to inner-city Black American youth that has gone global and is wielded to <b>tag,</b> <b>label,</b> and brand urban Pacific Islanders of South Auckland. Therefore, how are the aspirational interests of this niche market reflected in the content and context of initiatives with South Auckland Pacific Islander communities in mind...|$|E

We also group tags into broader genres, to check their validity against past findings. Our results are robust across both tag and genre levels of analyses, and consistent with existing literature.

40|$|An 11 -residue peptide {{with the}} {{sequence}} DSLEFIASKLA was identified from a genomic library of Bacillus subtilis by phage display as an efficient substrate for Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling by small molecule-CoA conjugates. We name this peptide the “ybbR tag,” {{because part of}} its sequence {{is derived from the}} ybbR ORF in the B. subtilis genome. The site of Sfp-catalyzed ybbR <b>tag</b> <b>labeling</b> was mapped to the underlined Ser residue, and the ybbR tag was found to have a strong tendency for adopting an α-helical conformation in solution. Here we demonstrate that the ybbR tag can be fused to the N or C termini of target proteins or inserted in a flexible loop {{in the middle of a}} target protein for site-specific protein labeling by Sfp. The short size of the ybbR tag and its compatibility with various target proteins, the broad substrate specificity of Sfp for <b>labeling</b> the ybbR <b>tag</b> with small-molecule probes of diverse structures, and the high specificity and efficiency of the labeling reaction make Sfp-catalyzed ybbR <b>tag</b> <b>labeling</b> an attractive tool for expanding protein structural and functional diversities by posttranslational modification...|$|R
