5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, {{but it was not a}} significant concern.|$|E
5|$|Mission {{managers}} {{called up}} to <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> alert them of the find, advising Altman ("Scooter") {{that one of the}} orbiter's wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent, around 104 – 106 seconds following liftoff, which may have been the cause of the damage seen in that area.|$|E

5|$|Monssen {{avoided the}} wreck of Barton and steamed onward looking for targets. She was noticed by Asagumo, Murasame, and Samidare who had just {{finished}} blasting Laffey. They smothered Monssen with gunfire, damaging her severely and forcing <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> abandon ship. The ship sank some time later.|$|E
5|$|On stardate 1254.4, while {{exploring}} {{near the}} center of the galaxy, the Federation starship USS Enterprise is caught inside an energy/matter vortex and all her computer systems fail. A being named Lucien (voiced by James Doohan) appears on the bridge, repairs the ship's systems and takes <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> explore his planet, Megas-Tu.|$|E
5|$|The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center was {{predicting}} {{less than}} favorable weather for Friday's landing, so managers asked <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> power down some non-critical systems to help conserve power, {{in the event}} that the orbiter is not able to land until Saturday.|$|E
50|$|This week Status Quo {{received}} the most votes over JabbaWockeeZ and Kaba Modern. The last challenge was for <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> illustrate <b>the</b> evolution of hip-hop using the same music. <b>The</b> final three <b>crews</b> had <b>to</b> perform to these songs using classic hip-hop moves such as Popping, Locking and Breakdancing. <b>The</b> <b>crews</b> were also <b>to</b> dance to Pop and new jack swing.|$|R

5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the crew {{experienced}} fuel flow disruptions to both right side engines, eventually leading {{both of them}} to shut down, after multiple unsuccessful attempts by <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> restore proper fuel flow and engine operation. Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which were operating normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E
5000|$|... "Scabs" [...] is {{the fourth}} episode of the second season of the American {{television}} drama series Hell on Wheels, which aired on September 2, 2012 on AMC. The fourteenth episode of the series is written by Catherine Hardwicke and directed by Chris Mundy. In the episode, the Sioux torture a railroad worker, causing <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> strike. Cullen (Anson Mount) telegraphs for replacement workers ("scabs"), forcing <b>the</b> <b>crews</b> <b>to</b> band together and save their jobs. Eva (Robin McLeavy) tells both Elam (Common) and Toole (Duncan Ollerenshaw) that she is pregnant with Elam's baby.|$|R

5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition cameras, the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make a film about the life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas of unemployment and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> watching audition tapes. Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was a challenging process that included over eighty locations.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, the {{remaining}} Vertigo Tour concerts were postponed when {{the daughter of}} guitarist The Edge fell ill. During the interim, footage from the seven filmed shows was edited together, prompting <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> request additional wide shots {{from the back of}} the stadium and close-ups of the band members. When the tour was on its fifth leg in November 2006, an additional two shows were filmed in Melbourne to capture the extra footage. At the time, the songs appearing in the final cut of the film had already been selected and therefore only specific songs from the concerts were filmed.|$|E

5|$|In their spare time, {{crews were}} able {{to catch up with}} work, observe the Earth below, respond to letters, {{drawings}} and other items brought from Earth (and give them an official stamp to show they had been aboard Mir), or make use of the station's ham radio. Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> read and watch.|$|E
5|$|Johner (Ron Perlman) is a {{crew member}} and {{mercenary}} on the Betty. After the crew boards the Auriga they encounter Number 8, whom Johner tries to seduce.

The Aliens escape captivity, forcing Johner and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with Number 8 to escape from the Auriga. When he asks Number 8 how Ellen Ripley defeated the Aliens, she replies that Ripley died. Aboard the Betty, Johner and Vriess co-pilot their damaged ship to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into {{the hole in the}} hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> stop two of the three pumps.|$|E

5|$|Several planned filming {{locations}} {{were abandoned}} due to budget constraints. For thematic reasons, the film's penultimate fight scene between JTRO and L Dubba E was originally set at Dawn's Liquor Marta key {{location in the}} film. The store's owners refused permission for filming and the location was changed to a long-abandoned gas station. Bryan Goddard, who portrays Sugga Nigga, acquired permission for <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>to</b> film on the property.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s and 1990s {{were a very}} unsafe {{time for}} bulk carriers. Many bulkers sank during this time, 99 were lost between 1990 and 1997 alone.
