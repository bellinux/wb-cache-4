5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it <b>to</b> <b>deform.</b> This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the three}} {{prototype}}s began in late 1945 and the first prototype began manufacturer's testing on 30 December. The ground testing revealed that the engine exhaust caused a low-pressure area under the rear fuselage which caused the fighter to tilt tail-down during engine tests. The rigidly mounted heatshield caused {{the underside of the}} rear fuselage <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> because the steel and the duralumin skin of the fuselage had different expansion ratios when heated. The rear fuselage and the heatshield were both redesigned to eliminate these problems. On 23 March the prototype was trucked to the Flight Research Institute (LII)'s airfield at Ramenskoye to begin preparations for flight testing.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field <b>to</b> <b>deform.</b> When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the bilayer, Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the bilayer. Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a bilayer and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and bilayer thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{red blood}} cell {{elasticity}} {{is central to the}} pathophysiology of sickle-cell disease. Normal {{red blood cell}}s are quite elastic, which allows the cells <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> to pass through capillaries. In sickle-cell disease, low oxygen tension promotes red blood cell sickling and repeated episodes of sickling damage the cell membrane and decrease the cell's elasticity.

As a consequence, these rigid blood cells are unable <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> as they pass through narrow capillaries, leading to vessel occlusion and ischaemia.|$|E

40|$|This paper first generalises the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov unobstructedness theorem to {{the case}} of Calabi-Yau threefolds with {{canonical}} singularities. The deformation space of such a Calabi-Yau threefold is no longer smooth, but the general principle is that the obstructions <b>to</b> <b>deforming</b> such a threefold are precisely the obstructions <b>to</b> <b>deforming</b> the singularities of the threefold. Secondly, these results are applied to smoothing singular Calabi-Yau threefolds with crepant resolutions. Any such Calabi-Yau threefold with isolated complete intersection singularities which are not ordinary double points is smoothable. A Calabi-Yau threefold with non-complete intersection isolated singularities is proved to be smoothable under much stronger hypotheses...|$|R

25|$|The main {{advantage}} of press forging, {{as compared to}} drop-hammer forging, is its ability <b>to</b> <b>deform</b> the complete workpiece.
