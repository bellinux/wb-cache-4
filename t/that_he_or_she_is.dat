5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E

The work describes three encounters of the Girondin sympathizer Charlotte Corday with Jean-Paul Marat, leading figure of the radical Jacobin faction, two attempts and finally the assassination itself.|$|E

50|$|As a noun, {{the term}} is usually used in the plural form, even if it only refers to a single event: if a judge fines a party, it is not said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> imposed a sanction, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> imposed sanctions.|$|R
50|$|The {{acceptance}} of an unconditional benefit, therefore, is generally taken for granted, but not where the acceptance involves a liability, in which event the beneficiary has a choice or election whether to accept or to repudiate the benefit. For example, where the will leaves property {{to a person}} on condition <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> pays a sum of money to another person, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> gives another person some {{of his or her}} own property, <b>or</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> maintains and supports some other person.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission {{encourages}} {{any individual}} who believes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> Hispanic to self-identify as Hispanic. The United States Department of Labor - Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs encourages the same self-identification. As a result, any individual who traces {{his or her}} origins to part of the Spanish Empire or Portuguese Empire may self-identify as Hispanic, because an employer may not override an individual's self-identification.|$|E
25|$|According to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance, {{the winning}} {{candidate}} in the Chief Executive election shall, within 7 working days after the election, publicly make a statutory declaration <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{not a member of}} any political party and will not become a member of any political party or do any act that has the effect of subjecting himself to the discipline of any political party during his or her term of office.|$|E
25|$|A deployable, or delayed surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is an {{inflatable}} marker which the diver inflates while underwater and sends {{up at the}} end of a line to indicate position, and usually either <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> ascending, or that there is a problem. The use of a DSMB is common when divers expect to do decompression stops away from a fixed reference, or will be surfacing in an area with boat traffic, or need to indicate their position to the dive boat or surface team.|$|E

Certificates to this effect will be issued by the respective committees not later than the day before nomination day.|$|E
25|$|Drivers often flash {{headlights}} {{to indicate}} the intention to overtake or pass another driver, or to signal a driver who has just overtaken <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> far enough ahead to change back into the lane of the overtaken vehicle. Flashing is also commonly used to request or insist that a leading driver speed up or change lanes {{to get out of}} the way of a faster following driver. Headlight flashing may also be a part of aggressive driving, and can be used in an attempt to intimidate others into speeding or otherwise driving unsafely.|$|E
25|$|Genealogical DNA {{tests have}} become {{popular due to}} the ease of testing at home and their {{usefulness}} in supplementing genealogical research. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy {{whether he or she}} is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to a pecuniary interest, other forms of personal interest that an adjudicator has in a decision may give the impression <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> biased. As the High Court stated in Re Singh Kalpanath (1992), a likelihood of bias may arise because an adjudicator (1) has already indicated partisanship by expressing opinions antagonistic or favourable to the parties before him; (2) has made known his views about {{the merits of the}} very issue or issues of a similar nature {{in such a way as}} to suggest prejudgment; or (3) has a personal relationship with the party or there is close kinship between the adjudicator and a party.|$|E
25|$|On {{nomination}} day, {{the returning}} officer {{and his or}} her representatives will be present at designated nomination centres between 11:00am and 12:00 noon to receive prospective candidates' nomination papers, political donation certificates, and minority certificates (if required). Each nomination paper must contain a statement signed by the prospective candidate that he or she consents to the nomination; must include a statutory declaration by the prospective candidate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> qualified to be elected; and must be signed by a proposer, a seconder, and four or more persons as assentors, each of whom must be a person on the register of electors for the electoral division in which the person seeks election.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor {{with the introduction of}} pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|E

25|$|To begin, affective {{emotions}} {{and the effect}} infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both {{men and women alike}} feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful (Johnson, 2017). If some individual suspects <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> being cheated on they begin to question their partners actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. For example, they may ask more questions about the whereabouts of their partner or get upset more frequently and more often whenever they feel that their partner is lying or going out without them. Bursts of frustration without thinking it through or realizing why an individual is having those emotions can be an affective response in a difficult situation. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.|$|E
25|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that Negeri Sembilan {{has the largest}} number of converts, with 840 applications made to officially renounce Islam in 2005, 62 of which succeeded. An academic has suggested that this is because Negeri Sembilan is the only state which (officially) permits conversion. A convert must first apply to the Syariah Court for a declaration <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> no longer a Muslim; the convert will then be counselled for about a year by a Mufti. If, after this period, the convert still wants to convert, the judge may permit the application. This process is unique to the state; no other state allows Muslims to officially convert. In 2006, the Negeri Sembilan Court also permitted Wong Ah Kiu, a convert from Islam to Buddhism legally known as Nyonya binti Tahir, to be buried in the Buddhist fashion, although her conversion had not been legally recognised while she was still alive. The case marked the first time non-Muslims had testified in a Syariah court in Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|More {{information}} {{in regards to}} [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was revealed by Gaga, {{in an interview with}} Google where she explained the song as being about one's final moments on Earth, before death. Another inspiration for the song was actor Sylvester Stallone's 1976 film Rocky, which is Gaga's favorite film. The singer felt that the song was about looking at life directly, with the feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a champion—like the emotion displayed by the character Rocky Balboa in the film.|$|E

Still another exception is [...] "the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing {{the truth of the matter}} asserted."

He asserts that its symbolic function {{is to be found in}} this very [...] "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence."
