5|$|Harold's brother Tostig made probing attacks {{along the}} {{southern}} coast of England in May 1066, landing at the Isle of Wight using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders.

According to the Norman writer William of Jumièges, William had meanwhile sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> Harold of his oath to support William's claim, although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear.
