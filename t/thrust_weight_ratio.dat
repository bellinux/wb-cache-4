The configuration was sized to carry 290 passengers 6, 000 nautical miles nonstop. The final configuration has a maximum takeoff gross weight of 687, 200 pounds, a wing loading of 69. 8 lbf/sq. ft. and a <b>thrust</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of. 278.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{concepts}} for numerical simulation {{with the aim}} of improved un- derstanding of a miniaturized HEMP (High Eficiency Multistage Plasma) Thruster are pre- sented. A downscaled HEMP-Thruster is developed at Astrium GmbH at Friedrichshafen in cooperation with the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The aim is to reach the low thrust level and noise of the requirement for LISA (Light Interferometer Space Antenna) and similar for- mation flight space missions. With a complete model of the thruster and its environment, {{it should be possible to}} optimize characteristics like thrust beam divergence, <b>thrust</b> <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> and power consumption, as well as to determine if and how the LISA requirements can be met. Both an analytical and a particle model for calculating the electron confinement in the complex magnetic field topology are presented. A simplified fluid model gives first estimations of plasma density and electron temperature. Information about plasma potential and ring currents through E B drift is gathered. Comparison of the results of the different models are drawn...|$|E

General Electric was awarded a contract {{for the development of}} the J85 and Fairchild was awarded a contract for a competing engine, the J83. Fairchild proposed a lightweight engine of conventional design. GE used a more advanced design which yielded a higher <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

40|$|An initial {{assessment}} of the feasibility of a function space gradient method for computing solutions to minimum-fuel power-limited transfers encompassing {{a wide range of}} <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> is conducted.

At the lower end, there is reduced sensitivity of the fuel consumption to the control profiles. The minimum fuel consumption and the trajectory are computed quite accurately but the control profiles are in error.

50|$|The RS-83 is {{loosely based}} on the RS-68 that powers the Delta IV {{expendable}} launch vehicle. The RS-83 design is more efficient, lighter, slightly stronger, and yet reusable. The engine design weight was 12,700 lb (5,760 kg) with an engine <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of 52:1 at launch.|$|R
25|$|The {{proposed}} General Electric engine had a {{more advanced}} design, involving more risk, but having a higher <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> The XSM-73 was powered by the Fairchild J83 on all test flights but was also capable of using the General Electric J85.

[...] This {{is a function}} of achieving lower wing loading, higher <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> and superior aerodynamics. [...] This is sometimes described colloquially as “wrapping the smallest possible airframe around the most powerful available engine.” Professional analysis through 4th generation fighters shows that among heavier fighters only the F-15 has been generally competitive with lighter fighters, and its maneuvering performance is exceeded by several lighter fighters such as the F-16. [...] Light fighters have no inherent aerodynamic advantage for speed and range, but when designed to be as simple as possible they do tend to have lower wing loading and higher <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio.</b> [...] Additionally, smaller fighters are lower in inertia, allowing a faster transient response in maneuvering combat.|$|R

50|$|However, the Grumman {{design was}} {{able to create a}} design in which the FDAF and AS {{requirements}} did not significantly compromise each other. The F-14 would use a wing sweep program to optimize lift and drag at all combat speeds, twin tails for stability, greatly reduced weight through extensive use of titanium to achieve a better <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> than the F-4, a pancake fuselage for increased lift, a raised tandem cockpit for reduced drag and increased visibility, a gun for close-in fighting, and widely spaced engines for weapons carriage and survivability.

40|$|Research {{on nuclear}} thermal {{propulsion}} systems (NTP) {{have been in}} forefront of the space nuclear power and propulsion due to their design simplicity and their promise for providing very high thrust at reasonably high specific impulse. During NERVA-ROVER program in late 1950 's till early 1970 's, the United States developed and ground tested about 18 NTP systems without ever deploying them into space. The NERVA-ROVER program included development and testing of NTP systems with very high thrust (~ 250, 000 lbf) and relatively high specific impulse (~ 850 s). High <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> in NTP systems is an indicator of high acceleration that could be achieved with these systems. The specific impulse in the lowest mass propellant, hydrogen, {{is a function of}} square root of absolute temperature in the NTP thrust chamber.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{design for a}} transport aircraft has been created, tailored for human-itarian missions along the equator with its home base in the European Union while optimizing for fuel eciency and speed. An initial estimate of the empty weight was made using historical data and Breguet equations, based on a required payload of 60 tonnes and range of 5 500 nautical miles. A constraint diagram consisting of require-ments for stall speed, takeo distance, climb rate and landing distance {{was used to determine}} wing loading and <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio,</b> resulting in a main wing area of 387 m 2 and <b>thrust</b> to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0 : 224, for which two Rolls Royce Trent 1000 -H engines were selected. A high aspect ratio wing was designed with blended winglets to optimize against lift induced drag. Wing placement and tail volume were decided by iterative calculations, resulting in a centre of lift located aft of the centre of gravity during all stages of the mission. The resulting aircraft model has a high wing with a span of 62 m, length of 49 m with a takeo gross weight of 221 tonnes, of which 83 tonnes are fuel...|$|R
