Spinach pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce, and cheese. Variations can include black olives or pepperoni with <b>the</b> <b>spinach.</b>|$|E
25|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of <b>the</b> <b>spinach</b> family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Similarly, the Virginia creeper, a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E
