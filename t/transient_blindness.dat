40|$|Summary: <b>Transient</b> {{cortical}} <b>blindness</b> is {{an uncommon}} but well-known complication following cerebral angiogra-phy. One possible {{cause of this}} complication is an adverse reaction to contrast agent, resulting in an osmotic disrup-tion of the blood-brain barrier {{that seems to be}} selective for the occipital cortex. We report the case of a 16 -year-old male patient with cortical blindness after intravenous ap-plication of nonionic contrast agent during CT angiogra-phy performed because of seizure that was attributed to thrombosis of the basilar artery on the basis of clinical findings. To our knowledge, the development of cortical blindness after CT angiography has not been described in the literature. The patient’s symptoms were triggered by hyponatriemia and diabetes insipidus. <b>Transient</b> cortical <b>blindness</b> is a well-known but rare complication following administration of angio-graphic contrast agent. The onset of <b>transient</b> cortical <b>blindness</b> occurs within minutes to as much as 12 hours after contrast agent administration (8). Cortical blindness is self-limiting and characterized by bilat-eral amblyopia or amaurosis, normal papillary re-flexes, unaltered extraocular movements, and normal fundi. A combination with further symptoms (eg, hemiparesis, dysphasia, seizure, headache, memory loss) is possible (1). <b>Transient</b> cortical <b>blindness</b> was reported in cerebral, vertebral, brachial, aortic arch, renal, and coronary angiography, translumbal aortog-raphy, and myelography (1 – 5). The largest series of cortical blindness after cerebral angiography reported an incidence of 0. 3 – 1 % (6). The highest incidence was reported following vertebral angiography (7). To the best of our knowledge, there is no report of cortical blindness after contrast-enhanced CT in the litera-ture. We report the case of a 16 -year old boy with this rare condition and give possible explanations for this phenomenon. Case Report A 16 -year-old male patient was admitted to our unit with acute symptoms following first grand mal.

40|$|Objective. This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} specific findings related to acute posttraumatic atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation in pediatric patients. Methods. We studied 14 children with acute atlanto-axial rotatory subluxations {{admitted to a}} hospital over a 5 -year period after craniocervical injury. Clinical and radiological findings were reviewed to identify new findings related to atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation. Results. Most patients exhibited a typical picture of atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation, but one child also experienced <b>transient</b> <b>blindness</b> that was related to peculiar anatomical findings on neuroradiological images. A characteristic C 2 -C 3 anterior pseudo-subluxation was detected among the radiographic signs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no clear break in the alar ligaments, which were oriented horizontally. However, unlike the case in adult anatomy, in these children, the alar ligaments were laterally attached at the occipital condyle-axis condylar joints. In all children, atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation spontaneously reduced {{within a few hours}} after short bed rest without halter traction but with a cervical collar. No recurrence was observed during follow-up. Conclusions. Acute posttraumatic atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation in pediatric-aged patients is a rapidly resolving disease of the cranio-cervical junction. The disease appears to be related to an elasticity of the contralateral alar ligament, which is attached to the occipital condyle-axis condylar joint. Neurological symptoms (blindness) occurred in one patient when the vertebrobasilar blood flow was impaired and no compensation was provided from the anterior circulation. Use of a cervical collar and short bed rest without halter traction is recommended, based on our observations of complete recovery and no recurrence following the use of this treatment strategy...|$|E
30|$|While {{the risk}} of a crash within a tunnel is lower than that on an open road, a crash inside a tunnel often results in much more severe {{consequences}} (Amundsen and Ranes 2000). Furthermore, according to the Norway Highway Bureau, about 63.7  % of tunnel accidents occur at entrance zones. Similar results are also found in the analysis of tunnel accidents in China (Ma et al. 2009). These trends suggest that the driver’s difficulty in adapting to the change of light conditions inside and outside of the tunnel is a major factor in tunnel accidents. Therefore, many previous studies have examined drivers’ visual features while driving through a tunnel to assess {{the risk of}} crash and identify the potentially hazardous locations related to tunnel travel (Liu et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2015; Yan et al. 2015). Among these studies, illumination inside the tunnel has attracted wide interest (Cheng et al. 2006; Pachamanov and Pachamanova 2008; Bai et al. 2012; Du et al. 2014 a; Hu et al. 2014). Du et al. (2014 b) reported that the rapid change of illumination at a tunnel’s entrance induces driver’s visual shock or <b>transient</b> <b>blindness</b> that increases the visual load. Bertozzi et al. (2011) also reported similar findings. More specifically, Martens et al. (1997) found that tunnel design (i.e. tunnel wall, lane width, longitudinal profile, road signs and markings, et al.) and illumination have some immediate effects on the driver’s driving behaviors, and similar findings were also reported in the previous researches of Kayser and Oasderski (1991), Kircher and Ahlstrom (2012) and Miller and Boyle (2015). Accordingly, countermeasures should be taken at the transition zones near tunnel entries and exits to decrease the risk of crashing.|$|E

40|$|Amaurosis fugax (<b>transient</b> monocular <b>blindness)</b> is {{a symptom}} of retinal {{ischemia}} just as contralateral hemiparesis and sensory loss are symptoms of cerebral ischemia. These symptoms are produced by atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid vessels at the ipsilateral carotid bifurca-tion and emboli from these areas causing focal, repetitive, retinal ischemia. A study of 31 endarterectomy patients was undertaken to see if eight patients with amaurosis fugax (25 %) could be differentiated from 22 patients with transient cerebral ischemia. The patients with amaurosis fugax were found to be younger. They all had 75 % or greater stenosis of the internal carotid artery at the bifurcation on the symptomatic side. They all had unilateral visual symptoms and these symptoms were relieved by surgery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In a {{prospective}} study {{it was our}} intention to evaluate the reliability and the predictive value of expiratory ethanol for the early detection of the occurrence of TURP syndrome and emphasize {{the role of the}} serum levels of glycine in clinical manifestation. METHODS: We studied 30 patients scheduled for elective traditional transuretral resection of the prostate performed with subarachnoid anesthesia. Serum sodium and glycine concentrations, serum osmolality and end-expiratory ethanol levels were monitored at scheduled intervals. Continuous heart rate and blood pressure monitoring was performed during the perioperative period in the operativing room and, later, in the recovery room. Occurrence of cardiocirculatory, respiratory and neurologic symptoms were recorded. Statistics included Bonferroni's t-test and Fisher's exact test. A decision level plot for end-expiratory ethanol level was performed for the choice of predictivity criterion. RESULTS: In our population we identified three groups of patients: Group I (15 patients) in which no symptom was recorded; Group II (6 patients) in which non-specific anesthesia-related symptoms occurred; Group III (9 patients) in which TURP syndrome of various degree of severity was observed. In this group of patients changes in serum sodium and glycine concentrations, serum osmolality and end-expiratory ethanol levels were significantly different compared with the other two groups. In regard to end-expiratory ethanol levels, we identified a cut-off point at 0. 05 mg/ml. In Group III two patients developed <b>transient</b> <b>blindness.</b> These patients had the highest serum glycine concentrations (> 4000 mumol/ml). Mortality was nil. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the reliability and accuracy of end-expiratory ethanol levels as a predictive test of the occurrence of TURP syndrome.

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) lymphomatosis is a fatal {{complication}} of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In lymphoblastic or Burkitt lymphoma, without specific CNS prophylaxis {{the risk of}} CNS relapse is 20 - 30 %. DLBCL has a lower risk of relapse (around 5 %) but several factors increase its incidence. There is no consensus or trials to conclude {{which is the best}} CNS prophylaxis.

Other options are the administration of intrathecal (IT) MTX, cytarabine or liposomal cytarabine (ITLC). Our aim is to analyze the experience of the centers of the Balearic Lymphoma Group (BLG) about the toxicity and efficacy of ITLC in the prophylaxis and therapy of CNS lymphomatosis. We retrospectively reviewed cases from 2005 to 2015 (n = 58) treated with ITLC. Our toxicity results were: 33 % headache, 20 % neurological deficits, 11 % nausea, 9 % dizziness, 4 % vomiting, 4 % fever, 2 % <b>transient</b> <b>blindness</b> and 2 % photophobia. In the prophylactic cohort (n = 26) with a median follow-up of 55 months (17 - 81) only 3 CNS relapses (11 %) were observed (testicular DLBCL, Burkitt and plasmablastic lymphoma, with a cumulative incidence of 8 %, 14 % and 20 % respectively). In the treatment cohort (n = 32), CSF complete clearance was obtained in 77 % cases. Median OS was 6 months (0 - 16). Death causes were lymphoma progression (19 patients, 79 %), treatment toxicity (2 patients) and non-related (3 patients, 12 %). Toxicity profile was good especially when concomitant dexamethasone was administered. In the prophylactic cohort the incidence of CNS relapse in DLBCL group was similar to previously reported for HDMTX and much better than IT MTX. A high number of ITLC injections was associated with better rates of CSF clearance, clinical responses, PFS and lower relapses.
