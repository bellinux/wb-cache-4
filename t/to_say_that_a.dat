5|$|It is {{one thing}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not make any sense <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that}} he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

5000|$|<b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> such <b>a</b> {{proposition}} {{is justified}} is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we have grounds for asserting that any proposition {{of the form}} (t) is true where t is any expression that denotes, or could denote <b>an</b> object. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> assertion is unjustified, on the other hand, is merely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{we do not have}} such grounds; and that {{is not the same thing}} as <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we have grounds for denying it.” ...|$|R

25|$|Although the {{relationships}} listed above {{are likely to}} be instances of inalienable possession, ultimately what is classified as inalienable depends on language- and culture-specific conventions. It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> particular relationship is an example of inalienable possession without specifying the languages for which this holds true. For example, neighbor may be an inalienable noun in one language, but alienable in another. Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as alienable or inalienable can be arbitrary, and in this respect alienability is similar to other types of noun classes, such as grammatical gender.|$|E
25|$|Naturally, in an {{organisation}} {{of critical}} thinkers that has endured for a century, {{the existence of}} some disagreement is inevitable. Indeed, it would be true <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fair number of internal debates and disagreements have arisen in the Socialist Party concerning issues {{not covered by the}} Declaration of Principles and not addressed in the initial membership test – in other words, issues which are somewhat peripheral or incidental rather than core and fundamental. These issues have included the Party's exact attitude to trade unionism, its view of capitalist economic crises, and – in more recent years – whether something akin to law will exist in socialist society.|$|E
25|$|It is {{one thing}} to impose a tax {{dependent}} upon the conduct of the taxpayers, or of the state in which they live, where the conduct to be stimulated or discouraged is unrelated to the fiscal need subserved by the tax in its normal operation, or to any other end legitimately national. … It is quite another thing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tax will be abated upon the doing of an act that will satisfy the fiscal need, the tax and the alternative being approximate equivalents. In such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the bounds of power.|$|E

25|$|The {{high level}} of {{similarities}} leads Crossan {{to believe that there}} must have been a common source. Similar to the reasoning behind the two-document hypothesis for the existence of a Q source, the percentage of common material found in Thomas and Q would suggest an earlier source shared by the authors of both documents. However, unlike Q, the Common Sayings Source is presumed to be oral, due to a lack of common order or sequence. This is not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> written document is an impossibility. It is clear in the Synoptic Gospels that it was common for authors to edit works for their own needs, including the slight change in the order or sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed so far as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could have found out the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd {{was told by the}} elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave told Mr Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. Then Mr Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Mr Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement {{from the fact that it}} was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E

50|$|In practice, {{the terms}} STS-1 and OC-1 are {{sometimes}} used interchangeably, though the OC designation {{refers to the}} signal in its optical form. It is therefore incorrect <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> OC-3 contains 3 OC-1s: an OC-3 {{can be said to}} contain 3 STS-1s.|$|R
500|$|Hitler {{disapproved of}} the {{military}} personnel's freedom to smoke, and during World War II he said on 2 March 1942, [...] "it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, {{at the beginning of}} the war". He also said that it was [...] "not correct <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> soldier cannot live without smoking". He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke. He even began to offer a gold watch to any of his inner circle who could quit. However, Hitler's personal distaste for tobacco was only one of several catalysts behind the anti-smoking campaign.|$|E
500|$|While deconstructionists have {{concluded}} that we must abandon any further attempts to create a comprehensive vision of the world, Cobb and other constructive postmodernists believe that metaphysics and comprehensive world-models are possible and still needed. [...] In particular, they have argued for a new Whiteheadian metaphysics based on events rather than substances. [...] In this formulation, it is incorrect <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> person or thing ("substance") has a fundamental identity that remains constant, and that any changes to the person or thing are secondary to what it is. [...] Instead, each moment in a person's life ("event") {{is seen as a}} new actuality, thus asserting that continual change and transformation are fundamental, while static identities are far less important. [...] This view more easily reconciles itself with certain findings of modern science, such as evolution and wave-particle duality.|$|E
500|$|The next type of uncertainty, ascertainability, {{is where}} it is {{impossible}} to find the beneficiaries, either because they have died, moved or changed names. This is not necessarily fatal; the test for deciding if it is or not was laid out by Wynn-Parry J as: [...] "mere difficulty of ascertainment is not of itself fatal to the validity of the gift. As has been pointed out, {{it is a matter of}} degree, and it is only when one reaches, on the evidence, a conclusion that it is so vague or that the difficulty is so great that it must be treated as virtually incapable of resolution, that one is entitled, to my mind, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> gift of that nature is void for uncertainty". If a beneficiary cannot be found despite strenuous steps to find one, the trustees can apply for a Benjamin Order, named after the case of Re Benjamin, which authorises them to distribute the property as if the beneficiary is dead. The final type of uncertainty is administrative unworkability — where the trust is, by its very nature, so impractical that the trustees cannot carry out their duties. Where this prevents the trustees carrying out their duties, the trust will be declared invalid, and not applied.|$|E
