People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful house/You may tell yourself, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful wife".|$|E
500|$|Not My Life is a 2011 American {{independent}} {{documentary film}} about human trafficking and contemporary slavery. The film was written, produced, {{and directed by}} Robert Bilheimer, who {{had been asked to}} make the film by Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Bilheimer planned Not My Life as the second installment in a trilogy, the first being A Closer Walk and the third being the unproduced Take Me Home. The title Not My Life came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, who said that many people deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, saying, [...] "No, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E

500|$|Bilheimer {{said that}} the level of cruelty he saw in {{shooting}} Not My Life was greater than anything he had seen when documenting apartheid in South Africa for The Cry of Reason. Bilheimer attested to becoming more aware of the global extent of human trafficking as he went about making Not My Life. The film's title came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, an organization dedicated to human rights education operating in ten African countries. As Bilheimer and Melching spoke in Thiès, Senegal, discussing how people often deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, Melching said, [...] "People can say, 'No, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> life.' But my life can change. Let's change together." ...|$|E

Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: [...] "I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push 'God Save The Queen' for the number one spot. This campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. It is certainly not my personal plan or aim. I am proud of what The Sex Pistols achieved and always will be but this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> campaign.

2500|$|In the Notebook poems, Lowell {{included}} the poem [...] "In The Cage," [...] a sonnet {{that he had}} originally published in Lord Weary's Castle. He also included revised, sonnet versions of the poems [...] "Caligula" [...] and [...] "Night-Sweat" [...] (originally published in For the Union Dead) and of [...] "1958" [...] and [...] "To Theodore Roethke: 1908-1963" [...] (originally published in Near the Ocean). In his [...] "Afterthought" [...] {{at the end of}} Notebook 1967-1968, Lowell explained the premise and timeline of the book: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> diary, my confession, not a puritan's too literal pornographic honesty, glad to share private embarrassment, and triumph. The time is a summer, an autumn, a winter, a spring, another summer; here the poem ends, except for turned-back bits of fall and winter 1968 ... My plot rolls with the seasons. The separate poems and sections are opportunist and inspired by impulse. Accident threw up subjects, and the plot swallowed them--famished for human chances. I lean heavily to the rational, but am devoted to surrealism. In this same [...] "Afterthought" [...] section, Lowell acknowledges some of his source materials for the poems, writing, [...] "I have taken from many books, used the throwaway conversational inspirations of my friends, and much more that I idly spoke to myself." [...] Some of the sources and authors he cites include Jesse Glenn Gray's The Warriors, Simone Weil's Half a Century Gone, Herbert Marcuse, Aijaz Ahmad, R. P. Blackmur, Plutarch, Stonewall Jackson, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.|$|E
