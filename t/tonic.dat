5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza – Trio. The {{first part}} of the scherzo proper cadences not in the <b>tonic</b> or dominant, but in the subdominant. The second, B part, {{continues}} to modulate by ascending fourths, until it reaches the key of D-flat major. In this key, a new theme is presented, emphasizing the local subdominant (G-flat major, a further fourth upward) – first in the major mode, then in the minor, with an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor. This harmonic excursion eventually leads, through A major and a B diminished triad, back to the <b>tonic</b> and the opening section. The trio is in binary form and in B-flat minor, the first presentation of the <b>tonic</b> minor in the sonata.|$|E

5|$|I. Allegro. The sonata {{begins with}} a forte, heavily {{textured}} chordal fanfare emphasizing a low A pedal and duple-meter stepwise diatonic ascent in thirds in the middle voices, followed immediately by quiet descending triplet arpeggios punctuated by light chords outlining a chromatic ascent. These highly contrasting phrases provide the motivic material {{for much of the}} sonata. The second theme is a lyrical melody written in four-part harmony. The exposition follows standard classical practice by modulating from <b>tonic</b> (A) to dominant (E) for the second theme, even preparing the latter tonality with its own V – the only first movement {{to do so in the}} mature Schubert. Despite this traditional approach, both exposition themes are built in an innovative ternary form, and in each resulting 'B' section a highly chromatic development-like section based on the exposition's second phrase modulates through the circle of fourths, only to return to the <b>tonic.</b> This novel structure creates a sense of harmonic movement without actually committing to a thematic modulation, and is one of the techniques Schubert uses to achieve a sense of scale in the movement. The development proper is based on a scalar variation of the second theme heard at the end of the exposition. Here, in contrast to the striking modulatory excursions nested in the exposition, the tonal plan is static, shifting constantly between C major and B major (later B minor). After the development theme is finally stated in the <b>tonic</b> minor, the dramatic retransition has the unconventional role of only shifting to the major mode to prepare the recapitulation, rather than fully preparing the <b>tonic</b> key (which in this case has already been established). The recapitulation is traditional – staying in the <b>tonic,</b> and emphasizing the <b>tonic</b> minor and the flat submediant (F major) as subdominant tonalities. The coda restates the first theme, this time in a much more 'hesitant' manner, pianissimo and with further allusions to subdominant tonalities. The movement ends with serene arpeggios; however, for the penultimate chord, Schubert chose a striking Italian sixth on II, instead of the more usual dominant or diminished seventh chords. This choice is not arbitrary – it is a final statement of the chromatically-based ascending minor second motive that pervaded the movement, a motive that will be reversed into a descending minor second in the following movement.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{identify}} the possible safety-influencing factors in {{use of the}} <b>tonics</b> of Chinese medicine. MethodsThe related case reports published in periodicals published from 1949 to 2006 were analyzed with the bibliometrics method. Possibility on safety assessment of Chinese materia medica was discussed {{as well with the}} method of link analysis. ResultsThe total number of the <b>tonics</b> selected for the present study was 101, including 44 single drugs and 46 set prescriptions with adverse drug reactions (ADR) found in these <b>tonics.</b> It was found that ADR of 10 single drugs and 29 preparations were not specified in authoritative Chinese materia medica monographs. Among all the set prescriptions, the problem of injection has been standing on the top. Statistical analysis on single factor demonstrates that the most frequently referred ADR come from drug abuse (accounting for 29. 20 %), and overdose (24. 54 %). ConclusionThe safety problem of injection remains in a trend of robust growth at least for a period of time, thus reappraisal of the safety issue for the <b>tonics</b> of injection is imperative. It is essential for the public to take doctor's advice to guarantee safe administration of the <b>tonics,</b> especially for the patients with allergic constitution or those suffering from the liver and heart diseases...|$|R

5|$|The first {{movement}} is in 3/4 time, hitherto uncommon among Haydn's opening movements. In this movement, Haydn departs from the monothematic approach that characterises {{many of his}} other sonata form movements in the set.

5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, is replete with Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the <b>tonic</b> {{at the end of}} the recapitulation and apparent coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating an illusion of finality. However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E

5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal <b>tonic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The orchestral exposition, 99 {{measures}} long, presents {{two groups}} of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the <b>tonic</b> of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. The theme is tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.|$|E
5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the <b>tonic.</b> It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the <b>tonic</b> that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
