5|$|Although {{connected}} with the council, Gilbert was tried after the council closed, at a consistory held in the Archbishop of Reims' chambers. A consistory was a specialized form of trial held to investigate questionable theological teachings, and was beginning {{to be used for}} this purpose in this period. The consistory lasted <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> included John of Salisbury, who had previously been a student of Gilbert's, but was now in Eugene's service. The trial likely took place on 2–3 April 1148, as it lasted took <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> most accounts state that it took place during the week before Palm Sunday, which was 4 April that year. As the consistory took place after the closing of the council on 1 April, that only allows 2 and 3 April for the trial. However, if the council closed earlier than 1 April, then the trial could have taken place on 29–30 March 1148. In the end, no verdict of heresy was placed against Gilbert, who remained Bishop of Poitiers until his death in 1154.|$|E

The military police raided the party and called the local police for assistance after confronting Maxwell's group. Maxwell was fined £20 and sent back to his unit for his actions.|$|E

5|$|The chicks' {{eyes open}} after about four days and, {{at an age}} of about eight days, the young birds get their first down. If both parents perish, the ensuing {{intensive}} begging sounds of the young often attract replacement parents which feed them until they can sustain themselves.

Dick Miller, who had starred as the protagonist of A Bucket of Blood was offered the role of Seymour, but turned it down, instead taking the smaller role of Burson Fouch. Production at the Bucket of Blood sets was compressed into three days of cast rehearsals, immediately followed by <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> one night of principal photography.|$|E

5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the gradual}} {{evolution}} of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively; this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as prime ministers. Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> Waldegrave after three. Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as Prime Minister, {{and they are not}} listed.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States Grand Prix on 24 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at various racing circuits across Europe between 26–29 September {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren's test driver Olivier Panis flew to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours to undertake preparations for Suzuka and development work on their 2001 car. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent two days at the Fiorano Circuit testing mechanical components and ran on an artificially wet track for testing of Bridgestone's wet weather tyre compounds. Williams, with rookie competitor Jenson Button, went to the Autódromo do Estoril for <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> tried wet weather tyres and different aerodynamic configurations. Prost travelled to Magny-Cours and their test driver Stéphane Sarrazin collected three days of chassis design data for the upcoming AP04 chassis. Benetton opted to miss testing prior to the event but their test driver Mark Webber tried developments at the Circuit de Catalunya that were incorporated into their 2001 car.|$|E
