40|$|In 3 GPP networks, the {{signaling}} path between a calling user and a called user can be partitioned into segments, {{referred to as}} traffic legs. Each <b>traffic</b> <b>leg</b> may span networks belonging to different operators and will have its own characteristics that can be different from other traffic legs in the same call. A <b>traffic</b> <b>leg</b> might be associated with multiple SIP dialogs, e. g., in case a Back-to-Back User Agent (B 2 BUA) that modifies the SIP dialog identifier is located within the <b>traffic</b> <b>leg.</b> This document defines a new SIP URI parameter, ’iotl ’ (an abbreviation for Inter-Operator <b>Traffic</b> <b>Leg).</b> The parameter {{can be used in}} a SIP URI to indicate that the entity associated with the address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the address, represents the end of a specific <b>traffic</b> <b>leg</b> (or multiple traffic legs). The SIP URI ’iotl ’ parameter defined in this document has known uses in 3 GPP networks. Usage in other networks is also possible. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.

50|$|Born in Asbury Park, New Jersey, he {{graduated}} from Ocean Township High School and resides in Hollywood, California. In 2010, Rindner {{was involved in a}} <b>traffic</b> accident. His <b>leg</b> was badly injured and he spent nearly a year recovering.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Line {{planning}} {{is an important}} step to determine the optimal frequencies of trains given the forecasted demand for each train type. The main input data for line {{planning is}} the <b>leg</b> <b>traffic</b> demand which can be derived using suitable traf-fic assignment models. However most assignment models require a line plan, in other words, train frequencies or headways, so that inconsistent results just by the procedural approach to find an optimal line plan after determining <b>leg</b> <b>traffic</b> can be avoided. This paper suggests a unified model that can consider the traffic assignment and line planning, simultaneously. We further provide an elaborated approximation algorithm and, finally, provide experimental results determined for the Korea...|$|R
50|$|<b>Traffic</b> on both <b>legs</b> of the Lake-Dan Ryan {{line was}} nearly level until the mid-1970s when {{passenger}} volumes began to shift on the West-South Route and the North-South Route (Howard-Englewood/Jackson Park), inclusive, with heavier {{traffic on the}} Howard and Dan Ryan branches, and lesser traffic on the Lake Street and South Side branches. In February 1993, the CTA overhauled its system and launched a color-coded route plan. In the process, the Lake-Dan Ryan route was split. The Lake Street branch running west of the Loop {{became a part of}} the Green Line, and the Dan Ryan branch running south of the Loop became a part of the Red Line.|$|R
50|$|A {{major portion}} of the highway from the US 2 {{junction}} to Colville has been realigned and straightened over the years, including sections near Loon Lake, Chewelah, and Arden. The largest bypass was that of Loon Lake, which was built in 1957. Another bypass circumvented Old US 395 around Springdale. That highway eventually became SR 231 while its spur was officially dubbed SR 292. Further north {{near the town of}} Arden, a new highway section was built that paralleled the Old Arden Highway, which is now used mostly by local <b>traffic.</b> The last <b>leg</b> of US 395, from Colville to the Canada-United States border, has maintained almost exactly the same alignment since it was originally built. A pair of bridges linking Stevens County to Ferry County, known as the Kettle Falls Bridges, were constructed in 1941 in the vicinity of Kettle Falls over the Columbia River. After passing through some dense forest, the highway finally ends its journey at the border station in Laurier; where the highway transitions itself onto British Columbia Highway 395. In recent years, a number of changes have been made to address growing traffic issues; including (but not limited to) the addition of left-turn channelization at important intersections, a variety of different paving projects, the construction of two roundabouts in downtown Colville, a truck route that starts and ends at those roundabouts, and the addition of uphill passing lanes in some places.|$|R
