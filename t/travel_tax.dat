40|$|In recent years, air <b>travel</b> <b>taxes</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} by different countries throughout Europe. Often, these tax measures serve a revenue-raising goal, but are promoted as measures that aim to cut back carbon emissions by the aviation industry. Their effectiveness {{with respect to the}} reduction of carbon emissions is limited, however. After all, it holds no incentive for airlines to actively reduce emissions. The paper shows that the level of ‘pass through’ is of substantial importance for the effects that result from this introduction. Passenger reactions as a result of (partial) pass through include demand reduction, modal shift, origin airport shift and destination shift. The sum of the environmental effects is expected to be limited or even negative. Finally, the introduction of air <b>travel</b> <b>taxes</b> leads to revenue loss for airports and the tourist industry and to tax revenues for the government. On the other hand, governments face decreasing VAT and profit tax revenues and increasing unemployment expenses...|$|R

50|$|The Air <b>Travel</b> <b>Tax</b> was an Irish tax {{applied to}} flights departing from {{airports}} in Ireland. It {{was introduced in}} the 2009 Budget. Until 28 February 2011, there were two rates of tax, €10 for each passenger flying to an airport more than 300 km from Dublin Airport, and €2 per passenger flying to any other airport within 300 km. As the differential rate was considered by the EU to be an interference with the internal market, this was changed to a flat rate of €3 from 1 March 2011. The tax was opposed by airlines and the tourism industry. Transit passengers are excluded.|$|E

As Minister of Finance he tried to cause an economic upheaval in Israel by abolishing foreign currency regulations and <b>travel</b> <b>tax,</b> as well as cheapening imported goods.

5000|$|However, Darby faced {{extensive}} challenges at LIAT.

Furthermore, he had not anticipated the complexity of three islands with limited budgets having stakes in the airline, with resultant necessity for consensus in decision-making and [...] "lack of clear shareholder direction". However, in April 2009 Darby was dismissed from LIAT over a dispute surrounding his decision to compensate workers for going beyond the call of duty, saying the payments to staffers were not exorbitant and were in the range of EC$1,000 - EC$2,000 (US$375-US$750) a month. The board claimed he had acted above his authority; he later sued successfully for unfair dismissal. He described his three years at LIAT as [...] "fascinating and hard work, but rewarding".|$|R

5000|$|Begin's {{economic}} policies sought to liberalize Israel's socialist economy towards a more free-market approach, and he appointed Simha Erlich as Finance Minister. Erlich unveiled {{a new economic}} policy that {{became known as the}} [...] "economic transformation". Under the new plan, the exchange rate would from then on be determined by market forces rather than the government, subsidies for many consumer products were cancelled, foreign exchange controls were eased, the VAT tax was raised while the <b>travel</b> <b>tax</b> was cancelled, and customs duties were lowered to encourage imports of more products. The plan generated some improvement; cheap and high-quality imported products began to fill consumer shelves, the business sector benefited greatly, and the stock market recorded rising share prices. However, the program did not improve the lives of the Israeli people as Begin had hoped. The combination of the increased VAT, the end of subsidies, and a rise in the U.S. dollar exchange rate set off a wave of inflation and price increases. In particular, the fact that government spending was not significantly reduced in tandem with the liberalization program triggered a massive bout of inflation. On July 17, 1978, the Israeli cabinet met to discuss rising inflation, but Begin, declaring that [...] "you cannot manage economics over the housewife's back", halted all proposals. In the end, the government decided not to take any actions and allow inflation to ride its course. Begin and his other ministers did not internalize the full meaning of the liberalization plan. As a result, he blocked attempts by Erlich to lower government spending and government plans to privatize public-sector enterprises out of fear of harming the weaker sectors of society, allowing the privatization of only eighteen government companies during his six-year tenure. In 1983, shortly before Begin's resignation, a major financial crisis hit Israel after the stocks of the country's four largest banks collapsed and were subsequently nationalized by the state. Inflation would continue rapidly rising past Begin's tenure, and was only brought under control after the 1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan, which among other things greatly curbed government spending, was introduced. The years of rampant inflation devastated the economic power of the powerful Histadrut labor federation and the kibbutzim, which would help Israel's approach towards a free-market economy.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide additional empirical evidence of what explains respondent uncertainty in contingent valuation (CV) and how this in turn affects stated willingness to pay (WTP). Air travelers asked to pay a carbon <b>travel</b> <b>tax</b> to offset carbon emissions from flying were asked how likely it is that they will actually pay if the tax is voluntary. When changing the market compliance imperative from a mandatory carbon tax to a voluntary contribution, a third of all air travelers consider it unlikely they will actually pay their stated WTP amount. An ordered probit estimation approach is applied to identify the sources of respondent uncertainty. Besides the bid price, respondent sense of responsibility and belief in the effectiveness of the voluntary carbon market are among the main reasons for the experienced uncertainty. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Tourism’s {{increasing}} {{contribution to}} climate change, especially {{through the use}} of air travel, is now acknowledged. This study seeks to explore tourists ’ knowledge and awareness of aviation’s impact on the climate, their sense of personal responsibility and their reactions to specific climate change policies. A focus group approach – in-formed by interviews with international tourists leaving New Zealand – was chosen to involve tourists in discussing climate change and travel. In the focus groups, three policy options were discussed: voluntary initiatives, a global air travel charge and a per capita carbon budget. The global air <b>travel</b> <b>tax</b> emerged as a realistic compromise between restricting travel and achieving emissions reduction. When discussing in-dividual responsibility for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, tourists distinguished between their travel and their everyday life, where responsibility for mitigation was perceived to be greater. The value of freedom to travel is firmly established {{in the minds of many}} tourists and limiting travel is considered unacceptable by the (hy-per) mobile tourists who participated in this research. Only major societal changes to bring about behavioural change seem likely to reduce air travel’s contribution to climate change. doi: 10. 2167 /jost 710. ...|$|E

Try to find the cheapest apartment in Oxford considering rent, <b>travel,</b> <b>tax</b> and heating costs; or a cheap, reasonable reviewed 11 ” laptop with an SSD drive. Data extraction flushes structured information out of this sty: It turns mostly unstructured web pages into highly structured knowledge. In this chapter, we give a gentle introduction to data extraction including pointers to existing systems. We start with an overview and classification of data extraction systems along two primary dimensions, the level of supervision and the considered scale. The rest of the chapter is organized along the major division of these approaches into site-specific and supervised versus domain-specific and unsupervised. We first discuss supervised data extraction, where a human user identifies for each site examples of the relevant data and the system generalizes these examples into extraction programs. We focus particularly on declarative and rule-based paradigms. In the second part, we turn to fully automated (or unsupervised) approaches where the system by itself identifies the relevant data and fully automatically extracts data from many websites. Ontologies or schemata have proven invaluable to guide unsupervised data extraction and we present {{an overview of the}} existing approaches and the different ways in which they are using ontologies. 1...|$|E
