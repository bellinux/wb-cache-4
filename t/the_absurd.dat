5|$|In 2016, in {{correspondence}} of the 70th Anniversary birthday, The Theatre of <b>the</b> <b>Absurd,</b> an Italian independent artists group, {{published a}} short movie {{in honor of}} Syd Barrett named Eclipse, with actor-director Edgar Blake {{in the role of}} Syd. Some footage from this movie was also showed at the Syd Barrett - A Celebration during Men on the Border's tribute: the show took place at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, with the participation of Syd's family and old friends.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often {{with a sense of}} humor that bordered on <b>the</b> <b>absurd.</b>|$|E
5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> explanation that this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E

5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the Theatre of <b>the</b> <b>Absurd.</b> Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E
5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of <b>the</b> <b>absurd,</b> and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's famous 9-page paper started {{life as a}} talk at Princeton {{and then}} became a paper in German, which was {{eventually}} translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows: When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest, {{and so did the}} economist Nicholas Kaldor, and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist Léon Walras. Von Neumann found some faults in that book and corrected them, for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras' Law, which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> result that the profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, absurdism is a {{philosophical}} {{school of thought}} stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information {{as well as the}} vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of <b>the</b> <b>Absurd</b> and how individuals, once becoming conscious of <b>the</b> <b>Absurd,</b> should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.|$|E

25|$|For Camus, {{the beauty}} people {{encounter}} in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning {{in their own}} lives, {{which may not be}} the objective meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>absurd,</b> lest the fictitious meaning take the place of <b>the</b> <b>absurd.</b>|$|E

25|$|Theatre of <b>the</b> <b>Absurd</b> {{is a new}} and {{somewhat}} rare genre {{in the history of}} Urdu Literature.

25|$|When used {{to detect}} whether a {{difference}} exists between groups, a paradox arises. As improvements are made to experimental design (e.g., increased precision of measurement and sample size), the test becomes more lenient.

Abdicate, and wash his hands of it,--in favour of the first that would accept! Other clear wisdom there was none for him. As it was, he stood gazing dubiously, <b>the</b> <b>absurdest</b> mortal extant (a very Solecism Incarnate), into <b>the</b> <b>absurdest</b> confused world;--wherein at lost nothing seemed so certain as that he, the incarnate Solecism, had five senses; that were Flying Tables (Tables Volantes, which vanish through the floor, to come back reloaded). and a Parc-aux-cerfs.|$|R

25|$|When {{the market}} for {{etchings}} collapsed {{during the great depression}} in the early 1930s, Blampied reinvented himself as a cartoonist and caricaturist at an exhibition in 1931 called “Blampied’s Nonsense Show”. This brought out his love of <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> and led to his only book, obscurely entitled Bottled Trout and Polo. In this period Blampied also published more than 30 humorous lithographs, many of dogs, that are not recorded in either of the catalogues raisonné (see Bibliography).|$|E
25|$|The {{relevant}} {{point here}} was, that price-value divergences occurred both {{with regard to}} inputs to production and with regard to outputs; but Marx himself had ignored the input price-value divergences in his simple quantitative illustrations {{of the distribution of}} profit. Since outputs become inputs, and inputs become outputs, critics alleged that unless input values are transformed in the calculation as well, <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> mathematical effect in the model is that capitalist producers selling a good obtain a sale price that differs from the price paid by capitalist producers buying the same good.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instance}} of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in The Sickness Unto Death, which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Exploring {{the forms of}} despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced {{at the beginning of}} the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of <b>the</b> <b>Absurd</b> Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.|$|E
