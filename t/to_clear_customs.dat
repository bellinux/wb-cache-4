5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs</b> and then flew to Croydon {{where it was}} {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Derby Aviation ceased flying training, {{following}} the award of a licence to operate scheduled flights from Burnaston and Wolverhampton to Jersey. Flights {{in each direction}} were required to land at Elmdon Airport in Birmingham to allow passengers <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs.</b> The first flight was made on 18 July 1953, using a Dragon Rapide. The following year, Wolverhampton Aviation was merged into Derby Aviation, and, in 1955, the company purchased its first Douglas DC-3, a converted former military transport.|$|E
500|$|In May 1919, Lympne {{was one of}} {{the first}} four customs and excise [...] "Appointed Aerodromes" [...] in the United Kingdom; along with Hadleigh in Suffolk, Hounslow Heath in Middlesex and New Holland in Lincolnshire. Although Lympne had a customs {{clearance}} point there was no permanent customs officer there; a telephone call to Folkestone Harbour was needed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs.</b> On 1 May the ban on civilian flying was lifted and a Sopwith Gnu was flown from Hounslow Heath to Lympne carrying a cargo of newspapers during that first day. In September, Sir Philip Sassoon purchased an Avro aircraft in which he commuted between London and his Lympne residence. In October the Air Ministry announced that searchlights would temporarily be displayed to assist aircraft to find certain airfields. Lympne was to be identified by three searchlights arranged in a triangle, their beams shining vertically. In November a Notice to Airmen was issued advising that radio telephony was in use at Hounslow Heath and Lympne, using the 900-metre wavelength. The practice of using the aircraft registration as a callsign was instigated. In December 1919 two Westland Limousine aircraft bound for the Paris Aero Show were delayed at Lympne by fog. Conditions later improved so that both aircraft were able to fly to Le Bourget, where G-EAJL was dismantled and transported to the Grand Palais where it was exhibited to the public. The other aircraft remained at Le Bourget where it gave pleasure and demonstration flights.|$|E

50|$|Constructed from 1992 to 1997, Woodlands Train Checkpoint {{was opened}} on 1 August 1998 as the Singapore border control {{facility}} for rail passengers. At that {{time there were}} no boarding facilities, as northbound passengers heading towards Malaysia were required <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> Malaysian <b>Customs</b> and Immigration at Tanjong Pagar railway station in central Singapore, and northbound trains stopped at Woodlands Train Checkpoint for Singapore exit immigration checks only. However, southbound passengers could disembark after <b>clearing</b> Singapore <b>Customs</b> and Immigration at Woodlands Train Checkpoint, as they had already cleared Malaysian Immigration at Johor Bahru railway station.|$|R

It {{is a small town}} located {{directly}} across the Rio Sixaola from Sixaola, Costa Rica. An elevated former railroad grade and bridge connects Guabito to Sixaola. This border crossing is popular with tourists going between Costa Rica and Bocas del Toro, though few tourists stop in Guabito longer than necessary <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> Panamanian <b>customs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|There were {{significant}} bottlenecks created {{by lack of}} infrastructure and red tape. [...] The United Nation's Children's Fund reported on Thursday that aid for 200,000 people, including medical supplies, soap and tarpaulin, was being held at Jakarta for a day <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs.</b> [...] The US consul in Medan in southern Sumatra reported that aid there was piling up at the airports of Medan and Banda Aceh because there were not enough trucks to transport it.

Plans {{call for the}} service starting from 1–2 trains per month in April–June 2014, gradually increasing the frequency to 1–2 trains per week in 2015. A new customs facility is under construction in Wuhan's Wujiashan (吴家山) industrial area; after its planned opening in October 2015, [...] exports from the Wuhan region will be able <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> Chinese <b>customs</b> there, instead of Alashankou.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. In order for DOD sponsored items <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> foreign <b>customs,</b> DOD employs a {{unique set of}} paperwork, Government Bills-of-Lading (GBL) that are different from that used in the commercial sector. The use of GBL allows duty-free passage of government sponsored shipments through foreign offices for delivery to U. S. Forces. USTRANSCOM issued the policies and regulations that govern Customs Clearance procedures for DOD sponsored shipments to deployed forces around the world. In compliance with the directive to "Adopt Best Business Practices" from the commercial sector, this thesis examines the policies and/or procedures currently in place that govern the movement of material in and through Foreign Customs Offices.

5000|$|In 2012, it was {{announced}} that certain officers and directors at Layne Christensen Company were under investigation in connection with allegations that certain payments by the company <b>to</b> <b>customs</b> <b>clearing</b> agents in connection with importing equipment into the Democratic Republic of Congo potentially might have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Layne voluntarily alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice of the possible discrepancies.

5000|$|As {{a legacy}} of the British colonial period, the Malaysian rail network had its {{southern}} terminus at Tanjong Pagar railway station in central Singapore. The land on which the station and the rail tracks stood was leased to Keretapi Tanah Melayu, the Malaysian state railway operator. Consequently, Malaysia had partial sovereignty over the railway land. Passengers had <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> Malaysian <b>customs</b> and immigration checks at Tanjong Pagar before boarding the train to Malaysia, even after Singapore shifted its border control facility to the actual border in 1998 and objected to the continued presence of Malaysian officials at the station. After a 20-year long dispute, the station was closed in 2011 and the railway land reverted to Singapore. A remnant of the rail corridor is still in use; KTM trains now terminate at Woodlands Train Checkpoint in northern Singapore near the border, which houses Malaysian and Singaporean border controls for rail passengers.|$|R
50|$|On December 22, 2015 at 8:45 a.m. a Porter Airlines flight with 66 {{on board}} was {{diverted}} to Williamsport Regional Airport due to reports of thick {{smoke in the}} cockpit and cabin. The flight from Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport to Washington Dulles International Airport had to make an emergency landing in Williamsport. Two crew members were taken to Williamsport Regional Medical Center to be checked out due to smoke inhalation. The sixty six passengers {{were taken to the}} terminal <b>to</b> be <b>cleared</b> by <b>customs</b> and then were able to leave airport grounds. The next day Porter Airlines brought a new Dash 8 400 to continue the passengers to Washington D.C.|$|R
50|$|All twelve vessels were {{assembled}} at Roche Harbor <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs,</b> {{that being}} the most northerly customs house from which to begin the transfer north, which they were to make under their own power. Robert Moran himself was on the lead boat, Pilgrim, which was {{under the command of}} Capt. Edward Lennan, a highly skilled Alaska pilot. Accompanying the flotilla were the steam tugs Richard Holyoke and Resolute, the steam schooner South Coast, and six supply barges.|$|E
5000|$|Service {{commenced}} on 6 March 2013 and {{was suspended}} on 6 May 2013 - no {{date has been}} published for a resumption of flights. The company indicated that the suspension of service was due to [...] "ongoing French Customs and Immigration delays in setting up a point of entry at Paris Pontoise airport". The flights had been obligated to land at another airport in France first <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs,</b> usually Rouen Airport or Le Touquet - Côte d'Opale Airport.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Virgin Islands are an {{independent}} customs territory {{from the mainland}} United States and operate largely as a free port. U.S. citizens thus do not have <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs</b> when arriving in the U.S. Virgin Islands, but do when traveling to the mainland.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that firms can reduce fixed trade costs by hiring {{intermediaries}} like trading companies. I argue that customs brokers – a type of intermediary rarely studied in economics before – can play a similar role. Using panel data of Norwegian trade transactions, I show that such brokers are commonly used <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> goods through <b>customs.</b> I find indications of lower sunk costs as well as fixed trade costs for firms that hire such services. However, engaging brokers can be risky, and traders in high-risk products like food {{are more likely to}} self-declare. Results are similar for importing and exporting, indicating that customs brokers facilitate both modes of trade...|$|R
5000|$|Nobody on {{the surface}} {{was aware of the}} level of {{casualties}} at the time, and authorities called the rescue vessel Kurtaran to the scene to help the remaining sailors. While waiting for Kurtaran, the sun began to rise, the heavy mist started <b>to</b> <b>clear,</b> and the <b>customs</b> ship spotted the emergency communications buoy that had been released by the trapped sailors. Second handsman of the customs ship Selim Yoludüz reached for the phone located inside of the communications buoy and read the inscription on it, which said, [...] "The submarine TCG Dumlupınar, commissioned to the Turkish Navy, has sunk here. Open the hatch to establish contact with the submarine".|$|R
5000|$|Rasst shipped {{the arms}} to Odessa {{but did not}} appear there in time <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> it through <b>customs.</b> As a result, the Russian {{government}} seized the consignment. Rasst {{with the help of}} the Russian embassy in Washington was able to get the shipment released and sent to Hamburg. However, there Rasst could not pay for the freight charges resulting in the German government impounding the shipment. Money from the American financier and Huerta supporter John Wesley De Kay finally achieved a release. The arms now went to Havana with German-made Mauser rifles and cartridges added to it. The arms on Ypiranga required [...] "three trains of ten cars each" [...] to unload.|$|R

40|$|The {{costs of}} {{paperwork}} and delays needed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> international <b>customs</b> are generally {{perceived as a}} time-consuming impediment to international trade. However, few studies have empirically examined the determinants {{and the impact of}} this type of government-imposed transaction costs. This paper analyses the role of firm size as a determinant of customs-related transaction costs, as well as the effect of firm size on the relationship between these costs and the international trade intensity of firms. We submit that economies of scale should be related {{to the size of the}} activities the firm is specialised in, and not directly linked to the size of a firm per se. The results of this study indicate that customs-related transaction costs repress international trade activities of firms, even at low levels of these costs. The paper identifies transaction-related economies of scale, simplified customs procedures and advanced information and communication technology as main determinants of customs-related transaction costs. When these factors are taken into account, firm size has no effect on customs-related transaction costs. Policy implications are considered for firm strategy and public policy. firm size;international business strategy;international trade intensity;trade barriers...|$|R

50|$|On 5 December 2001, pirates {{shot and}} killed Blake {{while he was on}} an {{environmental}} exploration trip in South America, monitoring global warming and pollution for the United Nations. The two-month expedition was anchored off Macapá, Brazil, {{at the mouth of the}} Amazon delta, waiting <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs</b> after a trip up the Amazon river. At around 9 pm a group of six to eight armed, masked robbers wearing balaclavas and crash helmets boarded the Seamaster. As one of the robbers held a gun to the head of a crewmember, Blake sprang from the cabin wielding a rifle. He shot one of the assailants in the hand before the rifle malfunctioned; he was then fatally shot in the back by assailant Ricardo Colares Tavares. The boarders injured two other crew members with knives, and the remaining seven were unhurt.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, Thomas Doherty {{published}} Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939, which {{explored the}} relationship between the American film industry and Nazi Germany. In his early research, Doherty was not able to locate a single copy of Hitler's Reign of Terror. Late into his research, however, Doherty received news that the Royal Belgian Film Archive in Brussels had located a copy of the film in their possession. Doherty's theory is that a Belgian film distributor must have ordered a copy of the film from outside the country before the Nazis invaded Belgium. Being a foreign film, the copy had <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>customs.</b> After the Nazis invaded the country, though, the distributor likely {{did not want to be}} caught with the film, and never picked it up from customs. As a result, the film lay on a back shelf in cold storage in Belgium for almost eighty years.|$|E

5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an Hs code (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods.

50|$|A brewery {{worker from}} a village near Augsburg, Bavaria, Kreuz spoke no English {{and had never}} {{experienced}} international travel except for a day-trip to Switzerland when he boarded a World Airways charter flight from Germany to San Francisco in October 1977. When the plane stopped at the Bangor International Airport to refuel and allow passengers <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> American <b>customs</b> and immigration before re-boarding, Kreuz mistakenly believed he had arrived in California, and took a taxi into the city. For four days, he vainly searched for the Golden Gate Bridge and other San Francisco landmarks. The only sight which resonated with his prior image of the California city were the two local Chinese restaurants. He concluded {{he was in a}} suburb of the metropolis, and only realized his mistake when a taxi driver somehow communicated to him, in response to his request to be taken to San Francisco, that it was a 3,000 mile journey. He ended up in a German-themed restaurant in nearby Old Town, Maine, whose German-speaking owner, Gertrude Romine, was the first to hear his story and give him a complete picture of where he was. The Romines found him a hotel room in the nearby town of Milford while {{trying to figure out what}} to do. His story was picked up by the local press, and soon went national.|$|R
