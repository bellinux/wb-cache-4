40|$|Naoum Abi-Rached {{wonders what}} {{foundations}} {{are necessary for}} being able to establish a dialogue and establish <b>trust,</b> <b>bearing</b> in mind that the references and the experiences one has lived through are distinct. What supports do language and ways of speaking need inorder to overcome suspicion, establish trust and culminate in a dialogue that will not be a dialogue of the deaf? For Abi-Rached, trust does not have its own existence, and it is conceived only in the process of a relationship with others. This author prefers to define the I in interaction with the Other and not through the Other. But, who is this Other? Friend or foe? Through writing, an attempt is made at re-establishing the lost balance of a society threatened at its foundations. The violence that we find in these writings issometimes a cry of pain or an interrupted dialogue, but the novels are constructed to refind the lost trust or to illustrate a trust which is being lost...|$|E
40|$|Different {{methods are}} used for {{production}} of bronze bearings. In terms of technical specifications, the success {{of each of these}} methods depends on the bond’s strength and in terms of economic, the production method is important. In this study, the aim is to study the strength and microstructure of steel-bronze thrust bearing bond that has been produced through the casting using pre-mold. In this study, in order to bond, the raw metals are chemically washed with sulfuric acid solution for five minutes at first. Then, the molten bronze SAE 660 is cast in a structural steel S 235 JR pre-mold. The bond’s strength has been measured using the shear test three times; the measurement of bond’s length has been done using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The results indicate that the strength of the bond is at least 94. 8 MPa and bond’s length is 0. 45 micrometers. Therefore, this method was successful for <b>trust</b> <b>bearing</b> application...|$|E

Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction."--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she <b>trusted</b> to its <b>bearing</b> the same construction with him.

As X-Catholics obsessed with a guilt they cant accept and committed to a subculture that gives them no peace, Exene and John Doe are prey to both misconceptions, and their struggle with them is thrilling and edifying ... Who knows whether the insightful ministrations of their guitarist will prove as therapeutic for them as for you and me, but I say <b>trust</b> a bohemian <b>bearing</b> gifts. How often do we get a great love album and a great punk album in the same package?" [...] Christgau later ranked the album third on his Personal Best list for the 80s, the highest placing of any rock album.|$|R
6000|$|Measurement of Angles.--Rude Measurements.--I {{find that}} a capital {{substitute}} for a very rude sextant is afforded by the outstretched hand and arm. The span between the middle finger and the thumb subtends an angle of about 15 degrees, and that between the forefinger and the thumb an angle of 11 1/4 degrees, or one point of the compass. Just as a person may learn to walk yards accurately, so may he learn to span out these angular distances accurately; and the horizon, however broken it may be, is always before his eyes to check him. Thus, if he begins from a tree, or even from a book on his shelves and spans all round until {{he comes to the}} tree or book again, he should make twenty-four of the larger spans and thirty-two of the lesser ones. These two angles of 15 degrees and 11 1/4 degrees are particularly important. The sun travels through 15 degrees in each hour; and therefore, by [...] "spanning" [...] along its course, as estimated, from the place where it would stand at noon (aided in this by the compass), the hour before or after noon, and, similarly after sunrise or before sunset, can be instantly reckoned. Again, the angles 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees, all of them simple multiples of 15 degrees, are by far the most useful ones in taking rough measurements of heights and distances, because of the simple relations between the sides of right-angled triangles, one of whose other angles are 30 degrees, 45 degrees, or 60 degrees; and also because 60 degrees is the value of an angle of an equilateral triangle. As regards 11 1/4 degrees, or one point of the compass, it is perfectly out of the question to <b>trust</b> to <b>bearings</b> taken by the unaided eye, or to steer a steady course by simply watching a star or landmark, when this happens to be much to the right or the left of it. Now, nothing is easier than to span out the bearing from time to time.|$|R
