500|$|Throughout December 2014, Banks {{released}} {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the breakdown video for [...] "Chasing Time", Banks revealed that the song was conceived after the aforementioned occasion of her handing a completed version of the album in to her labels. In response to their request that Banks created something more current, she produced [...] "Chasing Time". This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, we get it, you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, can you just give us one ?' So <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> 'Chasing Time', and I was just like, 'You know, this isn't gonna work out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Eisner's {{most trusted}} {{assistant}} on The Spirit, however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter {{in his own}} right. Eisner later said of their working methods [...] "You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending— I {{came up with the}} idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree".|$|E
2500|$|Heck {{became an}} Atlas staff artist on September 1, 1954; [...] his first known {{work for the}} company was the five-page horror story [...] "Werewolf Beware" [...] in Mystery Tales [...] #25 (Jan. 1955), though Heck in 1993 recalled, [...] "The first job I did was about a whale {{breaking}} a ship apart. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> [...] 'Torpedo Taylor' for Navy Combat," [...] drawing that five- or six-page feature in issues #1–14 and 16 (June 1955–Aug. 1957, Feb. 1958) and, oddly, doing one page of a five-page story finished by Joe Maneely in issue #19 (Aug. 1958). Until Atlas' 1957 business retrenchment — when it let go of most of its staff and freelancers and Heck spent a year drawing model airplane views for Berkeley Models — Heck contributed dozens of war comics stories and [...] Westerns plus a smattering of jungle and science-fiction/fantasy tales.|$|E

2500|$|He {{has long}} been a fan of Hollywood action man Steven Seagal, who he had {{mentioned}} several times on radio, and remarked that he would love to meet. However, when Seagal rang O'Connell the relationship and understanding between the two was quite difficult and left O'Connell feeling disappointed. Seagal did not understand O'Connell's ironic personality and sense of humour and much of the recorded interview had to be removed from the radio broadcast. The Observer described the interview as, [...] "a spectacularly terrible interview in which O'Connell's questions dropped into a seemingly bottomless well of apathy." [...] O'Connell described the interview remarking; [...] "It was the single worst thing I've ever done on radio. And the other week I was having a go at Michael Parkinson, saying he used to be fantastic but sadly now he's become too fawning, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the Seagal thing and I thought: I should just leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1941 Adorno {{followed}} Horkheimer to what Thomas Mann called [...] "German California", {{setting up}} {{house in a}} Pacific Palisades neighborhood of German émigrés which included Bertolt Brecht and Arnold Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with [...] a draft of his Philosophy of New Music, a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music, which Adorno himself felt, while writing, was already {{a departure from the}} theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: [...] "If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on this occasion," [...] he wrote after reading the manuscript. The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed itself from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as Philosophical Fragments, the text would wait another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, Dialectic of Enlightenment, by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This [...] "reflection on the destructive aspect of progress" [...] proceeded through the chapters which treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both Homer's Odyssey and the Marquis de Sade, as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.|$|E

What <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hear <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not hear now; what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see now. Thus it comes about that of Lesbos itself, of the shape of its {{mountains}} or the colour of its seas I can tell nothing more than I was told, because my sight never dwelt on them in any life that I can remember.|$|R

60|$|I complied, {{and still}} {{she was not}} quick enough of eye to see my draw. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it slowly, {{explaining}} to her the action of hand and then of finger. She seemed fascinated, as a woman might have been by the striking power of a rattlesnake.|$|E
