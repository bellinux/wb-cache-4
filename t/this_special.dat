5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles.

I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum riser. During live Rush shows the riser allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back).

5|$|The RAAF {{also took}} part in other Allied {{operations}} in the Mediterranean. Two RAAF squadrons, No.451Squadron (Spitfires) and No.458Squadron (Wellingtons), supported the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944. No.451Squadron was based in southern France in late August and September and when the operation ended both squadrons were moved to Italy, though No.451Squadron was transferred to Britain in December. No.459Squadron was based in the eastern Mediterranean until {{the last months of}} the war in Europe and attacked German targets in Greece and the Aegean Sea. In addition, 150Australians served with the Balkan Air Force, principally in No.148Squadron RAF. <b>This</b> <b>special</b> duties squadron dropped men and supplies to guerrillas in Yugoslavia and attempted to supply the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of <b>this</b> <b>special</b> sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
