40|$|Recently, {{generators}} using {{renewable energy}} {{have increased in}} usage within the power system. These continual increase of these generators is expected in future. Within the power system, output fluctuations of generators using renewable energy causes frequency and voltage fluctuations. Consequently, in the near future, power consumption will have the requirement to track the supply power by a demand-response system. Further, faster power fluctuations <b>that</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> by demandresponse {{will need to be}} compensated by battery systems. This paper describes a technique of frequency and voltage control by using demand-response and battery control for isolated power systems, which includes wind generators. Demand-response is executed corresponding to fluctuations in electric power price using real-time pricing. The H∞ control method installed in batteries is adopted as improvement over the conventional Droop control method. The H∞ control method is compared with the conventional improved Droop control method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation results in the Matlab/Simulink environment...|$|E

In practice, sharing human subject data can be complicated because data must be de-identified prior to sharing. Moreover, integrating varied data types collected in a study can be challenging and time consuming. For example, sharing data from structural imaging studies of a complex disorder requires the integration of imaging, demographic and/or behavioral data in a way that no subject identifiers are included in the de-identified dataset and with new subject labels or identification values <b>that</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> back to the original ones. We have developed a Java program that users can use to remove identifying information in neuroimaging datasets, while still maintaining the association among different data types from the same subject for further studies. This software provides a series of user interaction wizards to allow users to select data variables to be de-identified, implements functions for auditing and validation of de-identified data, and enables the user to share the de-identified data in a single compressed package through various communication protocols, such as FTPS and SFTP. DeID runs with Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems and its open architecture allows it to be easily adapted to support a broader array of data types, with the goal of facilitating data sharing.

40|$|A {{relatively}} new {{area of interest}} in aerospace systems survivability is the growing threat of spacecraft penetration by orbital debris. Orbital debris, or "space junk", is composed of the man-made remnants of non-functioning spacecraft still orbiting the Earth. NASA estimates that there are currently over 100, 000 orbital debris particles 1 centimeter in diameter or larger <b>that</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> by existing radar, with the population growing at approximately 4 % per year in low earth orbits. With an average velocity of over 8. 7 km/sec, these projectiles can penetrate and disable many vulnerable spacecraft systems. Since the likelihood of spacecraft penetration increases with spacecraft surface area, large spacecraft (such as the International Space Station) and communication satellite fleets (such as Iridium) have begun to adopt survivability enhancement strategies similar to those employed by combat aircraft. Collision avoidance maneuvers are commonly practiced by the Space Shuttle and are planned by the International Space Station to decrease their susceptibility to impact by trackable orbital debris; likewise, improved shielding, internal equipment placement, and improved crew operations following penetration can reduce the vulnerability of spacecraft to loss following orbital debris impact. Computer simulations such as the Manned Spacecraft and Crew Survivability (MSCSurv) program at the NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center have recently been developed to quantify and {{reduce the likelihood of}} crew or spacecraft loss following orbital debris penetration.

Si (c-Si) bulk. In both the initial and final phase of etching, where either only a-Si or only c-Si is exposed to the XeF 2 flux, we observe a similar evolution of the surface roughness {{as a function of}} the XeF 2 dose proportional to D(XeF 2) b with b~ 0. 2. In the transition region from the pure amorphous to the pure cryst. silicon layer, we observe a strong anomalous increase of the surface roughness proportional to D(XeF 2) b with b~ 1. 5. Not only the growth rate of the roughness increases sharply in this phase, also the surface morphol. temporarily changes to a structure that suggests a cusp-like shape. The remaining a-Si patches on the surface act effectively as a capping layer which causes the growth of deep trenches in the c-Si. The ellipsometry data on the roughness are corroborated by the AFM results, by equating the thickness of the rough layer to 6 s, with s the root-mean-square variation of the AFM's distribution function of height differences. In the AFM data, the anomalous behavior is reflected in a too small value of s which again suggests narrow and deep surface features <b>that</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> by the AFM tip. The final phase morphol. is characterized by an effective increase in surface area by a factor of two, as derived from a simple bilayer model of the reaction layer, using the exptl. etch rate as input. We obtain a local reaction layer thickness of 1. 5 monolayer consistent with the 1. 7 ML value of Lo et al. [Lo et al., Phys. Rev. B 47, 648 (1993) ] that is also independent of surface roughness.

In addition to ensuring confidentiality, with this mobile vote administration system the studentship of Ulm University has the opportunity of enhancing the operation of the election, because the election office is also mobile now and not fixed to any location in the University buildings. This enables that the election assistants go out for the students instead of waiting for them to come, and by that, the poll is likely to be increased.

40|$|End-to-end {{distortion}} estimation {{is critical}} to effective errorresilient video coding. The recursive optimal per-pixel estimate (ROPE) is a known approach to compute up to second moments of decoder-reconstructed pixels, and thereby optimally estimate the distortion. ROPE accurately accounts for encoding/decoding operations that are recursive in the pixel domain, and their interaction with packet loss and decoder concealment. The premise of this work is that considerable gains could be recouped by a dual estimation technique that would perform its recursion in the transform domain. This {{opens the door to}} accurate distortion estimation in conjunction with estimation-theoretic source coding approaches that involve transform domain operations, including improved prediction in both single-layer and scalable video coding. We present a novel recursive optimal estimate that operates entirely in the transform domain, namely, the spectral coefficient-wise optimal recursive estimate (SCORE). The method overcomes intricacies due to motion compensation from “off-grid ” blocks. We first demonstrate that its accuracy matches ROPE in the usual setting where ROPE is known to be optimal. Then we consider an enhanced encoding scenario involving spectral operations <b>that</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> accurately <b>tracked</b> by ROPE, but for which SCORE still maintains optimality and hence enables substantial end-to-end performance gains over a large range of packet loss rates.

40|$|During the {{adaptive}} immune response, lymphocyte populations undergo a characteristic three phase process: expansion {{through a series}} of cell divisions; cessation of expansion; and, finally, most of the accumulated lymphocytes die by apoptosis. The data used, thus far, to inform understanding of these processes, both in vitro and in vivo, is taken from flow cytometry experiments. One significant drawback of flow cytometry <b>is</b> <b>that</b> individual cells <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>tracked,</b> so <b>that</b> {{it is not possible to}} investigate interdependencies in the fate of cells within a family tree. This deficit in experimental information has recently been overcome by Hawkins et al. (2009) who report on time lapse microscopy experiments in which B-cells were stimulated through the TLR 9 receptor. Cells stimulated in this way do not aggregate, so that data regarding family trees can be recorded. In this article we further investigate the Hawkins et al. (2009) data. Our conclusions are striking: in order to explain the familial correlation structure in division times, death times and propensity to divide, a minimum of two distinct heritable factors are necessary. As the data shows that two distinct factors are necessary, we develop a stochastic model that has two heritable factors and demonstrate that it can reproduce the key features of the data. This model shows that two heritable factors are sufficient. These deductions have a clear impact upon biological understanding of {{the adaptive}} immune response. They also necessitate changes to the fundamental premises behind the tools developed by statisticians to draw deductions from flow cytometry data. Finally, they affect the mathematical modelling paradigms that are used to study these systems, as these are widely developed based on assumptions of cellular independence that are not appropriate...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{microbial}} communities play {{a central}} role in ecosystems and global cycles of elements. The microbial community compositions, functions as well as interactions between species and the environment have been studied with increasing effort. However, it is challenging to understand which parameters determine for the success of individual species to survive in a specific habitat. The often highly diverse microbial communities are continuously subjected to environmental stress such as biotic and abiotic fluctuations <b>that</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> completely <b>tracked.</b> To investigate the influence of different parameters on the ability of microorganisms to adapt to the environment, simple microbial communities, often single species are cultivated in the laboratory under strictly controlled conditions with reduced complexity. Such long-term experiments provide insight into the association between genetic and phenotypic alterations that evolve over hundreds or even thousands of generations. The availability of nutrients often affects microbial growth. This thesis describes the experimental evolution of Paracoccus denitrificans Pd 1222, a model denitrifying soil bacterium, to study the adaptation on acetate or nitrate limitation. Initially, nutrient limitation for the anaerobic growth of P. denitrificans was addressed with focus on trace elements (Chapter 2). New trace element solutions were designed based on previous reports and tested to exclude growth limitation or inhibition by these nutrients during long-term cultivation. Improved generation times of 4. 4 hours were achieved with a chelated trace element solution and lower concentrations than frequently used media. Chapter 3 describes the adaptive responses of P. denitrificans to acetate and nitrate limitation during experimental evolution in chemostats. In the course of at least 800 generations of P. denitrificans under denitrifying conditions the metabolic conversions of substrates were monitored. For deeper insights into different adaptive mechanisms of P. denitrificans under both conditions we investigated the transcriptomes and genome variations. Throughout the experiment the different treatments led to significantly different substrate conversion rates and transcriptomic profiles. Specifically, in nitrate limited cultures genes of the citric acid cycle and the nitrogen metabolism showed higher transcriptional activities than in acetate limited cultures. In the latter the transcription of genes encoding regulators and transporters was more pronounced. Additionally, more changes in transcriptional activities and in metabolism were observed over time than under nitrate limitation. Most notably, denitrification became more efficient resulting in the depletion of nitrite that accumulated in the culture during the first 500 generations. Although numerous mutations were detected in DNA obtained from this culture, they could not be related to the observed phenotypic changes. In all cultures the types and numbers of genetic variations did not considerably differ. The study indicated that P. denitrificans had a stronger potential to adapt to acetate limitation than to nitrate limitation and underlines the capacity of this bacterium to improve denitrification even in absence of environmental fluctuations. The possible explanation that phenotypic changes may have been independent of genetic variations is discussed in Chapter 4. The relevance of the insights gained in this study for natural, in particular denitrifying communities is presented and future studies towards the understanding of natural microbial community functions are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Two {{significant}} challenges face researchers tracking HIV-related socio-economic {{and demographic}} {{change over time}} in large cohort studies. Firstly, data collected in cohort studies established to describe the dynamics of HIV infection may contain no systematic data on household consumption expenditures which is an established measure of current and long-run household welfare. The second challenge is {{the choice of the}} unit of analysis in order to recognise and record impact; this is because most cohorts use the household as that unit. This means that the influence of factors outside <b>that</b> unit <b>cannot</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>tracked.</b> In this paper we show how a detailed understanding of the impact of HIV and AIDS on wider families and social networks, obtained through in-depth longitudinal research with a small number of households, can shed light on the findings from quantitative analysis from a larger cohort in the same population in rural Uganda. The findings of large-scale survey data from more than 2000 households over a 12 -year period showed a lack of a strong association between poverty, HIV status and/or death of the household head. In-depth ethnographic research with 26 households in 1991 / 2 and a restudy of the same households in 2006 / 7 provide insights into the reasons for this finding: the choice of socio-economic indicators and support from other family and community members play a part in affecting survey findings on the impact of HIV at household level. One other factor is important in explaining the findings. HIV-infected family members from outside the household may drain resources from the household, so looking at the impact of HIV and AIDS on people's wider families provides pointers to why those who have not had an AIDS-related death in their own household may have failed to prosper. Our qualitative findings show that AIDS may well throw households into disarray and poverty, but more often reduces development and hinders families from getting out of poverty. Used strategically, small longitudinal studies can provide important information with which to explain patterns observed in large-scale quantitative datasets.

40|$|During an {{adaptive}} immune response, lymphocytes proliferate {{for five to}} twenty five cell divisions, then stop and die {{over a period of}} weeks. Based on extensive flow cytometry data, Hawkins et al. (PNAS, 2007, 104, 50325037) introduced a cell-level stochastic model of lymphocyte population dynamics, called the Cyton Model, that accurately captures mean lymphocyte population size as a function of time. In Subramanian et al. (J. Math. Biol., 2008, 56 : 6, 861892), we performed a branching process analysis of the Cyton Model and deduced from parameterizations for in vitro and in vivo data that the immune response is predictable despite each cell's fate being highly variable. One drawback of flow cytometry data <b>is</b> <b>that</b> individual cells <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>tracked,</b> so <b>that</b> {{it is not possible to}} investigate dependencies in the fate of cells within family trees. In the absence of this information, while the Cyton Model abandons one of the usual assumptions of branching processes (the independence of lifetime and progeny number), it adopts another of the standard branching processes hypotheses: that the fates of progeny are stochastically independent. However, new experimental observations of lymphocytes show that the fates of cells in the same family tree are not stochastically independent. Hawkins et al. (2008, submitted for publication) report on cine lapse photography experiments where every founding cell's family tree is recorded for a system of proliferating lymphocytes responding to a mitogenic stimulus. Data from these experiments demonstrate that the death-ordivision fates of collaterally consanguineous cells (those in the same generation within a founding cell's family tree) are strongly correlated, while there is little correlation between cells of distinct generations and between cells in distinct family trees. As this finding contrasts with one of the assumptions of the Cyton Model, in this paper we introduce three variants of the Cyton Model with increasing levels of collaterally consanguineous correlation structure to incorporate these new found dependencies. We investigate their impact on the predicted expected variability of cell population size. Mathematically we conclude that while the introduction of correlation structure leaves the mean population size unchanged from the Cyton Model, the variance of the population size distribution is typically larger. Biologically, through comparison of model predictions for Cyton Model parameterizations determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments, we deduce that if collaterally consanguineous correlation extends beyond cousins, then the immune response is less predictable than would be concluded from the original Cyton Model. That is, some of the variability seen in data that we previously attributed to experimental error could be due to intrinsic variability in the cell population size dynamics...|$|R
