50|$|El Chorro Regional Park Campground {{features}} 63 campsites (43 {{sites are}} full hook-up with electricity, sewer and water; 18 sites are primitive with water nearby). Each site at the campground can accommodate approximately 6-8 people and either {{a couple of}} tents or a full-sized R.V. The maximum <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> {{at some of the}} sites is 40 feet, and {{there are a couple of}} pull-through sites.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} three common cab {{configurations}} used in tractors, two are still widely used. The conventional has an engine and hood over the front axle {{in front of the}} cab, as in most automobiles. This style is almost universal in North America. The cab over engine or cab forward has a flat nose cab with the driver {{sitting in front of the}} front axle. Widely used in the EU and Japan, this style has the advantages of good vision, maneuverability, and allows maximum <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> relative to overall length. In the North America this type of cab can be useful in straight trucks, but now has little advantage in tractors and is rarely used. A North American style cab over engine, now largely obsolete, had a flat nose cab located higher over the engine, with the driver sitting above the front axle. This allowed a sleeper compartment in a short tractor, and maximum wheelbase relative overall length, important for bridge formula weight restrictions. With the loosening of length restrictions in 1982 this style had limited applications, and is no longer manufactured for the U.S. market. This style is still however popular in Australia where length restrictions still apply on many roads and it is used to maximise the capacity of both single trailer and B double configurations, and American companies Freightliner and Kenworth still manufacture trucks in this style for this market. In Australia both styles of cab over engine truck as well as conventionals are in common use.|$|E

Trailer skirts are typically constructed of aluminum, plastic, or fiberglass, with plastic the most resistant to damage from side or bottom impacts.

50|$|In summary, {{the study}} {{concluded}} that LHVs could not be operated in the UK without changes to infrastructure, developing dedicated routes, and changing certain speed limits. It concluded that, depending on the industry take-up, LHV usage {{could lead to a}} net increase CO2 emissions by effecting a modal shift from rail, although it revealed that LHVs would result in a net reduction of fatalities due to the overall reduction in vehicles on the roads, and would substantially reduce freight transport costs (although capital investment costs had not been accounted for). The report found there could be several benefits to allowing the extension of existing articulated <b>trailer</b> <b>lengths,</b> creating Longer Semi-Trailers (LSTs).|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> on the passing ability of a double semi-trailer road train (B-Train), we built a B-Train model by using TruckSim, and confirmed the limit of the steering wheel angle when all wheels of the B-Train moved forward and the turning radius was minimum simultaneously by choosing dry pavement. Then, the turning process was simulated to analyze {{the relationship between the}} <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> and the turning channel width at low speed. The results showed that increasing <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> leads to the increase of the turning channel width of B-Train; the turning channel width is larger when the length of the first trailer is increased independently than that when the length of the second trailer is increased independently. In addition, according to the simulation results, we built the relation model between <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> variation and turning channel width using the least-square theory.

40|$|The 9 -meter {{wind tunnel}} of the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada is {{commonly}} employed in testing of class 8 tractors at full- and model-scales. In {{support of this}} work {{a series of tests}} of an identical model at full- and half-scale were performed to investigate some of the effects resulting from simulation compromises. Minimum Reynolds Number considerations drive the crucial decisions of what scale and speed to employ for testing. The full- and half-scale campaigns included Reynolds Number sweeps allowing conclusions to be reached on the minimum Reynolds number required for testing of fully-detailed commercial truck models. Furthermore the Reynolds sweeps were repeated at a variety of yaw angles to examine whether the minimum Reynolds Number was a function of yaw angle and the resulting flow regime changes. The test section of the NRC 9 -meter wind tunnel is not sufficiently long to accommodate a full-scale tractor and a typical <b>trailer</b> <b>length</b> of 482 ̆ 032 or more. Most of full-scale testing is therefore conducted with a more manageable 282 ̆ 032 trailer. To quantify the effects of this simplification the half-scale model was tested with representations of 282 ̆ 032 and 482 ̆ 032 trailers. The changes in the baseline drag curves will be presented along with the effect of trailer devices, such as skirts, on the different lengths of trailer. Copyright 9 2013 SAE International.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of a vision based Intermodal Train Monitoring System(ITMS) for extracting various features like length of gaps in an intermodal(IM) train which can later be used for higher level inferences. An intermodal train is a freight train consisting of two basic types of loads- containers and trailers. Our system first captures the video of an IM train, and applies image processing and machine learning techniques developed in this work to identify {{the various types of}} loads as containers and trailers. The whole process relies on a sequence of following tasks- robust background subtraction in each frame of the video, estimation of train velocity, creation of mosaic of the whole train from the video and classification of train loads into containers and <b>trailers.</b> Finally, the <b>length</b> of gaps between the loads of the IM train is estimated and is used to analyze the aerodynamic efficiency of the loading pattern of the train, which is a critical aspect of freight trains.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effect of specific factors on chipper performance by using a mobile industrial chipper in a real-life commercial setting. The comprehensive experimental design consisted of five replications per each combination of two types of raw material, two chip discharge systems, and two cut lengths (i. e., 5 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 40 replications). Each replication consisted of a full 18 -m 3 <b>trailer</b> load. Cut <b>length</b> was manipulated by using different drum types. When all else was equal, the doubling of cut length resulted in a 50 percent increase of average chip length, a 15 percent increase of net productivity, and a 15 percent decrease in fuel consumption. The handling characteristics of the raw material had a strong impact on chipper productivity’, causing variations {{on the order of}} 20 percent. The discharge system had no significant effect on fuel consumption or productivity, but it did impact product quality and bulk density. Using a blower allowed increasing bulk density between 4 and 7 percent, whereas the installation of a belt conveyor reduced the incidence of small chips and fine particles by up to 30 percent. ©Forest Products Society 2012...|$|R

However, he questioned [...] "how long can audiences be entranced by both the brilliance of Highmore's character's savant skills and the difficulties that come from his autism in the workplace." [...] Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer was [...] "both kinda progressive and really dated". He added, [...] "Too much felt on-the-nose — especially Hill Harper as the main character's detractor and Richard Schiff as his noble defender", while also commentating that [...] "On-the-nose/premise is how you have to trailer a show like this, and maybe spaced out over 43 minutes it won't grate." [...] Ben Travers and Steve Greene for IndieWire called it [...] "a serious trailer for a serious subject. The first glimpse of Highmore's character hints that they're toeing the line between presenting a thoughtful depiction of his condition and using his perceptive abilities as a kind of secret weapon."
