It sank and arose again--a headless, hideous, monstrous thing of menace. Its very silence rendered it the more terrible.|$|E
60|$|Through {{the open}} door of the small bedroom {{opposite}} her, Rilla saw Mrs. Anderson lying on the untidy bed; and Mrs. Anderson was dead. There was no doubt of that; neither was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that the big, frowzy, red-headed, red-faced, over-fat woman sitting near the door-way, smoking a pipe quite comfortably, was very much alive. She rocked idly back and forth amid her surroundings of squalid disorder, and paid no attention whatever to the piercing wails proceeding from a cradle in the middle of the room.|$|E

There was none on that point, none on any other. Suspicion shaped itself into conviction in an instant, and identified the stranger who had passed in the darkness {{between me and the}} bedside, with the man whose presence I had dreaded, as the presence of an evil spirit in the chamber of death.|$|E

60|$|It {{was curious}} {{testimony}} to Miltoun's character that, no more {{here than in}} the dining-hall, was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> of the integrity of his relations with Mrs. Noel. But whereas, there the matter was confined to its electioneering aspect, here that aspect was already perceived to be only the fringe of its importance.

60|$|Great was the jubilation, {{and many}} the {{inquiries}} after Primrose, {{who had once}} been nearly well, but had fallen back again, and Fly, who, Mysie said, was quite well and as comical as ever when she was well, but quickly tired. She had set out in high spirits, but had been dreadfully weary all {{the latter part of the}} journey, and was to go to bed at once. She still coughed, but Mysie was bent on disproving Nurse Halfpenny's assurance that the recovery would not be complete till May, nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> of her own air of perfect health.|$|E

He had not planned it, although he knew, now, that had he not procrastinated his going, had he not drifted, he could have foreseen it. And now, going could not mend matters. The madness of it, the hell of it and the joy of it, was that no longer was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt.</b> Speech beyond speech, his lips still tingling with the memory of hers, she had told him. He dwelt over that kiss returned, his senses swimming deliciously in the sea of remembrance.|$|E

60|$|On Saturday {{morning the}} inquest was held. There {{was not the}} {{slightest}} doubt as {{to any one of}} the incidents of the catastrophe. The servants, the doctor, and the inspector of police between them, learned that he had come home alone, that nobody had been near him during the night, that he had been found dead, and that he had undoubtedly been poisoned by prussic acid. It was also proved that he had been drunk in the House of Commons, a fact to which one of the clerks of the House, very much against his will, was called upon to testify. That he had destroyed himself there was no doubt,--nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> as to the cause.|$|E
60|$|The old Ironside who now {{appeared}} {{would not}} avouch his own disbelief in {{the identity of}} Master Peregrine, being, as he said, {{a man who had}} studied his Bible, listened to godly preachers, and seen the world; but he had no hesitation in declaring that almost every other soul in the household believed in it as firmly as in the Gospel, certainly all the women, and probably all the men, nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that the young gentleman conducted himself more like a goblin than the son of pious Christian parents. In effect both the clergyman and the Diplomate could not help suspecting that in other company the worthy butler's disavowal of all share in the superstition might have been less absolute.|$|E

6000|$|But gentlemen on {{the other}} side are {{unanimously}} agreed that General Taylor has no other principles. They are in utter darkness as to his opinions on any of the questions of policy which occupy the public attention. But is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> as to what he will do on the prominent questions if elected? Not the least. It is not possible to know what he will or would do in every imaginable case, because many questions have passed away, and others doubtless will arise which none of us have yet thought of; but on the prominent questions of currency, tariff, internal improvements, and Wilmot Proviso, General Taylor's course is at least as well defined as is General Cass's. Why, in their eagerness to get at General Taylor, several Democratic members here have desired to know whether, in case of his election, a bankrupt law is to be established. Can they tell us General Cass's opinion on this question? ...|$|E
60|$|All {{sorts of}} conjectures were rife, {{and there were}} many who said that they had all along {{expected}} harm would come of the marriage which had followed so soon after the death of Captain Sankey. The majority were loud in expression of their sympathy with the dead mill owner, recalling his cheery talk and general good temper. Others were disposed to think that Ned had been driven to the act; but among very few was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> as to his guilt. It was recalled against him that he had before been in the dock for his assault upon Mr. Hathorn, and that it had been proved that he had threatened to kill his master. His sullen and moody demeanor at the marriage of his mother told terribly against him, and the rumors of the previous quarrel when Ned had assaulted his stepfather, and which, related with many exaggerations, had at the time furnished a subject of gossip in the town, also told heavily to his disadvantage.|$|E
60|$|She {{was evidently}} {{extremely}} happy and valuable, much admired and respected, and with full exercise {{for the energy}} and cleverness, which were never more gratified than by finding scope for action. Her husband was devotedly attached to her, and was entirely managed by her, and though her good judgment kept her from appearing visibly in matters not pertaining to her own sphere, she was, in fact, his understanding. She read, listened, and thought for him, imbued him with her own views, and composed his letters for him; ruling his affairs, both political and private, and undeniably making him fill a position which, without her, he would have left vacant; nor was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that he was far happier for finding himself of consequence, and being no longer left a charge upon his own hands. He seemed fully to suffice {{to her as a}} companion, although she was so far superior in power; for it was, perhaps, her nature to love best that which depended upon her, and gave her a sense of exercising protection; as she had always loved Margaret better than Ethel.|$|E

6000|$|Neither with Nations {{that become}} miserable is it {{fundamentally}} otherwise. The ancient guides of Nations, Prophets, Priests, or whatever their name, {{were well aware}} of this; and, down to a late epoch, impressively taught and inculcated it. The modern guides of Nations, who also go under a great variety of names, Journalists, Political Economists, Politicians, Pamphleteers, have entirely forgotten this, and are ready to deny this. But it nevertheless remains eternally undeniable: nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> but we shall all be taught it yet, and made again to confess it: we shall all be striped and scourged till we do learn it; and shall at last either get to know it, or be striped to death in the process. For it is undeniable! When a Nation is unhappy, the old Prophet was right and not wrong in saying to it: Ye have forgotten God, ye have quitted the ways of God, or ye would not have been unhappy. It is not according to the laws of Fact that ye have lived and guided yourselves, but according to the laws of Delusion, Imposture, and wilful and unwilful Mistake of Fact; behold therefore the Unveracity is worn out; Nature's long-suffering with you is exhausted; and ye are here! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{death of}} the King was a great blow to what had now come to be {{generally}} styled the 'Conservative Cause.' It was quite unexpected; within a fortnight of his death, eminent persons still believed that 'it was only the hay-fever.' Had his Majesty lived until after the then impending registration, the Whigs would have been again dismissed. Nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that, under these circumstances, the Conservative Cause would have secured for the new ministers a parliamentary majority. What {{would have been the}} consequences to the country, if the four years of Whig rule, from 1837 to 1841, had not occurred? It is easier to decide what would have been the consequences to the Whigs. Some of their great friends might have lacked blue ribbons and lord-lieutenancies, and some of their little friends comfortable places in the Customs and Excise. They would have lost, undoubtedly, the distribution of four years' patronage; we can hardly say the exercise of four years' power; but they would have existed at this moment as the most powerful and popular Opposition that ever flourished in this country, if, indeed, the course of events had not long ere this carried them back to their old posts in a proud and intelligible position. The Reform Bill did not do more injury to the Tories, than the attempt to govern this country without a decided Parliamentary majority did the Whigs. The greatest of all evils is a weak government. They cannot carry good measures, they are forced to carry bad ones.|$|E
6000|$|For the rest, he is {{struggling}} between death and life; in general persuaded {{that the end}} is fast hastening on. He sends for Chief Preacher Roloff out to Potsdam; has some notable dialogues with Roloff, and with two other Potsdam Clergymen, of which there is record still left us. In these, as in all his demeanor at this supreme time, we see the big rugged block of manhood come out very vividly; strong in his simplicity, in his veracity. Friedrich Wilhelm's wish is to know from Roloff what the chances are {{for him in the}} other world,--which is not less certain than Potsdam and the giant grenadiers to Friedrich Wilhelm; and where, he perceives, never half so clearly before, he shall actually peel off his Kinghood, and stand before God Almighty, no better than a naked beggar. Roloff's prognostics are not so encouraging as the King had hoped. Surely this King [...] "never took or coveted what was not his; kept true to his marriage-vow, in spite of horrible examples everywhere; believed the Bible, honored the Preachers, went diligently to Church, and tried to do what he understood God's commandments were?" [...] To all which Roloff, a courageous pious man, answers with discreet words and shakings of the head, [...] "Did I behave ill, then; did I ever do injustice?" [...] Roloff mentions Baron Schlubhut the defalcating Amtmann, hanged at Konigsberg without even a trial. [...] "He had no trial; but was <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> he had justice? A public thief, confessing he had stolen the taxes he was set to gather; insolently offering, as if that were all, to repay the money, and saying, It was not MANIER (good manners) to hang a nobleman!" [...] Roloff shakes his head, Too violent, your Majesty, and savoring of the tyrannous. The poor King must repent.|$|E
