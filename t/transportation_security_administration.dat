5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a remote area so authorities could re-screen the plane, the passengers, and the baggage on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board the plane, and the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Administration</b> (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E

40|$|This project {{examines}} {{the impact that}} 9 / 11 has had on the everyday lives of Muslim Americans. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with South Asian and Arab American Muslim men and women living in the Chicago area, the data reveals Muslim Americans {{have been subjected to}} the process of de-Americanization, which is the stripping of social membership a privilege of citizenship. Religious signifiers, gender, and space all {{play an important role in}} the process of de-Americanization. Muslim men in the sample were more likely to experience this in private spaces while Muslim women who wear the hijab became targets in public spaces. Muslim women were more likely to resist this process by performing American values while wearing the hijab in order to reclaim their right to social membership and their right to space in the public sphere. Muslim women who wear the hijab had more encounters by non-state actors while Muslim men were targeted by state actors, such as <b>Transportation</b> and <b>Security</b> <b>Administration</b> agents. This study fills an important gap on research on 9 / 11 and Muslims in the United States as it focuses on the impact that 9 / 11 has had on Muslim Americans rather than Muslim immigrants. It also highlights the importance of aspects of citizenship that are often understudied, such as social membership and belonging, and the impact they have on individual lives. It not only reveals how Muslim Americans 2 ̆ 7 lives have changed since 9 / 11 it sociologically uncovers the boundaries of American citizenship...|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Administration</b> to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
