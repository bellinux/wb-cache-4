5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the thirteenth century onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 Boris Nemtsov, former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who {{was then}} an elected member of the State Duma {{and leader of the}} Union of Rightist Forces, paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge.

2500|$|The {{largest group}} by far <b>that</b> the <b>Russians</b> have called [...] "Tatars" [...] are the Volga Tatars, {{native to the}} Volga region (Tatarstan and Bashkortostan), who for this reason are often also simply known as [...] "Tatars", with their {{language}} known as the Tatar language. [...] they had an estimated population close to 6 million. There is a common belief <b>that</b> <b>Russians</b> and Tatars are closely intermingled, illustrated by the famous saying [...] "scratch any Russian just a little and you will discover a Tatar underneath" [...] {{and the fact that}} a number of noble families in pre-Petrine Russia had Tatar origins; however, genetics show <b>that</b> <b>Russians</b> form a cluster with Northern and Eastern Europeans (especially Belarusians and Ukrainians), and are very far from Tatar peoples.|$|R

5|$|Poti is {{the crucial}} port of Georgia on the Black Sea {{and serves as}} an {{essential}} entry point for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia. Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the port. Russia positioned ships {{in the vicinity of}} Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008. The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> troops were in Poti, although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by Russian troops in Poti. Russian deputy chief of the General staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied the Russian presence in Poti the following day. One day after Russia's declaration of the beginning of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 Russian soldiers moved into the port on the morning of 19 August. Russian forces took twenty-one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to a military base occupied by Russian troops in Senaki. The Wall Street Journal said <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy. Russian military was looting and damaging properties during their presence in Poti, even ransacking toilets.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian expert Anton Lavrov, on 8 August, Russian and South Ossetian troops {{deployed}} in South Ossetia were unaware <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> aviation {{was involved in}} the war. Russian troops and South Ossetians often assessed Russian aircraft as hostile and fired at them before precise identification took place. On 8 August, the air force performed 63 flights in support of Russian ground troops. A total of six Russian aircraft were lost during the war: one Su-25SM, two Su-25BMs, two Su-24Ms and one Tu-22M3; friendly fire was the cause of the downing of three planes. Lavrov denies that the downed Tu-22M was used for reconnaissance.|$|E

5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Crimean crisis, the Ukrainian government, in April 2014, {{announced}} that it would halt all military-technical cooperation with Russia. In August 2014, a Ukrainian court ordered the Russian Defence Ministry to make outstanding payments to Antonov. In March 2015, Russia Defence Ministry declared that it is ruling out the An-70 for state procurement. It also declared that, as in their opinion, Ukraine has withdrawn from the military and defence agreements signed before the crisis between them by completing the aircraft without Russian involvement, it would request return of 2.95 billion rubles <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> government had spent on An-70 project.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, Khrimian led the Armenian delegation at the Congress of Berlin. The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> pressure (and threat of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of autonomy for the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia.|$|E

50|$|Russian {{nationalism}} {{is a form}} of nationalism <b>that</b> asserts <b>that</b> <b>Russians</b> are a nation and promotes their cultural unity. Russian nationalism first rose in the 18th century and is closely related to Pan-Slavism, from its origin during the Russian Empire to the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{studies show}} <b>that</b> modern <b>Russians</b> are closest to Belarusians, Balts and Ukrainians. Some ethnographers, like Zelenin, affirm <b>that</b> <b>Russians</b> overall are {{more similar to}} Belarusians and to Ukrainians than {{southern}} Russians are to northern Russians. Russians in northern European Russia share moderate genetic similarities with Uralic peoples, who lived in modern north-central European Russia and were partly assimilated by the Slavs as the Slavs migrated northeastwards. Southern Russians however tend to be genetically closer related to Caucasian peoples {{as a result of}} Russian expansion.|$|R
5|$|On 17 August, Medvedev {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> {{forces would}} begin {{to pull out of}} Georgia the following day. The two countries exchanged prisoners of war on 19 August. A Georgian official said that although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians, among them two civilians, Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians. On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded towards Gori. Russia claimed that its military withdrawal was completed; however, Russian checkpoints remained near Gori and two Russian lookout stations remained near Poti. On 13 September, Russian troops began withdrawing from western Georgia and by 11:00 Moscow Time, the posts near Poti were abandoned. Withdrawals from Senaki and Khobi also took place. Russian forces withdrew from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 8 October and authority over them was transferred to the European Union monitoring mission in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd. There he attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued that the party should lead an armed insurrection to topple the Provisional Government.

Critics of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, argued <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> workers would not support a violent coup against the regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia largely loyal to the Bolsheviks that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet during Kornilov's alleged coup.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{admitted}} {{that three of}} its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber were lost. Georgia at that time claimed it had downed at least 21 Russian aircraft. Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate for air force losses, saying <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer fighter-bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost. Two helicopters, a Mi-8MTKO and a Mi-24, were wrecked in an accident after the hostilities.|$|E

5|$|The Russian Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C³I) {{performed}} poorly {{during the}} conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making {{contact with his}} combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone. Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used; the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was blacked out. Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised; an RIA Novosti editorial said <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> forces lacked reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead. However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war. General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the General staff, said that during the war, new weapons were not tried out.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the four}} ships were {{launched}} in 1915 and the fourth in 1916. Work on the gun turrets lagged, and it became evident <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> industry {{would not be able}} to complete the ships during the war. The Russian Revolution of 1917 put a stop to their construction, which was never resumed. Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to completion, they were all eventually sold for scrap by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Navy proposed in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but the plan was cancelled after political maneuvering by the Red Army led to funding not being available.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd via Vyborg.

This time, he was successful in his argument, and the motion was ratified with ten votes against two. Those critical of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, expressed the view <b>that</b> <b>Russian</b> workers would not support a violent coup against the existing regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October.
