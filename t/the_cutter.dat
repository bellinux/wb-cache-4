5|$|By early 2011, Hughes's {{velocity}} on {{his fastball}} was down several mph; John Harper of the New York Daily News speculated that Hughes's overuse of <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> was to blame, not a dead arm. Hughes {{continued to use}} <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> into {{the start of the}} 2012 season; he posted a 7.88 ERA in April, throwing <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> about 12% of the time in this span. In early May, Hughes dropped <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> from his repertoire, using it only 1.2% of the time {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June Governor King issued {{directions}} for Integritys second voyage. With Lieutenant Houstoun again in command, <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> was to transport Lieutenant-Colonel William Paterson {{to the north}} of Van Diemen's Land in order to found a new settlement at Port Dalrymple. To support the settlement, <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> was also assigned to carry nineteen soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, a ship's surgeon and ten convicts. A further fifteen soldiers and eleven convicts would accompany the expedition aboard a privately owned vessel, Contest. Once Paterson had disembarked at Port Dalrymple, Integrity was to follow the coastline of Port Phillip Bay so that Houstoun could survey the shore and determine its suitability for future colonisation. <b>The</b> <b>cutter</b> would then proceed to Cape Barren Island, a remote location in Bass Strait, to investigate rumours that a group of American sailors were establishing an unlawful trade in seal skins.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cutters</b> {{disguise}} {{themselves as}} Uglies {{in order to}} crash a party in Uglyville and search {{for members of the}} New Smoke. Tally successfully finds a girl giving out pills which cure the pretty lesions, which she encourages the Uglies to take to the Crims - Tally and Shay's old clique. <b>The</b> <b>Cutters</b> attempt to capture the girl, but she escapes on a hoverboard with David's help. Giving chase, <b>the</b> <b>Cutters</b> are ambushed by Smokies with unusually advanced technology, including infra-red masking sneak suits and electrical weapons. The Smokies kidnap Fausto, one of <b>the</b> <b>Cutters,</b> and leave Shay and Tally injured.|$|R
50|$|After talking, <b>the</b> <b>Cutters</b> (Tally, Shay, and Fausto) go hoverboarding with Aya, Hiro, Frizz and Ren. Aya has {{a signal}} {{up for her}} hovercam, and <b>the</b> <b>Cutters</b> boost it so the inhumans could find them. They are soon captured, and on the inhumans ship headed for a camp outside of the rusty ruins of Singapore. Frizz ruins their plan due to his Radical Honesty, so <b>The</b> <b>Cutters</b> knock out <b>the</b> inhumans and put the hovercar on autopilot, where more inhumans wait. <b>The</b> <b>Cutters,</b> Aya, Frizz, Hiro, and Ren {{jump out of the}} hovercar, not wanting to meet more inhumans. Soon, they have to travel through a jungle to meet David.|$|R

5|$|A year later, in July 2011, 60 of {{the owners}} of homes {{destroyed}} by the fire filed a civil lawsuit against Stihl Incorporated, the manufacturer of the brush-cutting equipment, alleging that Stihl failed to warn users that the metal blades of <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> could emit sparks capable of starting a fire in a high-risk area. In July 2013 Stihl agreed to settle the claims for an undisclosed amount of money.|$|E
5|$|In Apra Harbor, ten ships or tugs were sunk, as were {{numerous}} smaller vessels. One {{of the ships}} that survived in the harbor was <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> Basswood of the Coast Guard, which recorded a wind gust of 220km/h (140mph).

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cutters</b> {{went on to}} win the 1942-43 Boardwalk Trophy as the EAHL Champions, and {{proceeded}} to win the Walker Cup as the U.S. National Senior Hockey Champions. Apart from their EAHL schedule, <b>the</b> <b>Cutters</b> regularly played against Canadien service teams laden with NHL talent, normally defeating their foes to the north. In a contest against the Allen Cup champion Ottawa Army Commandos, <b>the</b> <b>Cutters</b> prevailed 5-2.

50|$|<b>The</b> annular <b>cutter</b> made by Hougen were {{comparatively}} safe, <b>the</b> annular <b>cutter</b> won't break free, {{the workers}} liked <b>the</b> <b>cutters</b> but <b>the</b> annular <b>cutter</b> could {{not solve the}} heavy weight problem of magnetic drilling machine. Hougen later reinvented the magnetic drilling machine making it just 28 lbs (12.70 Kg.). The reinvention of the magnetic drilling machine with its portability also gave birth to high volume sales of annular cutters.|$|R
5|$|Integritys first voyage was in February 1804, {{heading south}} along the eastern {{coastline}} of Australia to transport settlers and supplies across Bass Strait to the colonial outpost in Van Diemen's Land. The administrator of that outpost, Lieutenant John Bowen, had recently resigned his position and returned to Port Jackson. Governor King now directed that Bowen travel back to Van Diemen's Land aboard Integrity in order to formalise the transfer of colonial authority to his successor. However Bowen refused to go aboard, and <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> ultimately sailed without him in order to deliver its supplies. The voyage was a success other than a broken rudder fastener which was repaired when Integrity reached Van Diemen's Land in early March. <b>The</b> <b>cutter</b> then completed the round trip back to Port Jackson, arriving safely at her home port on 24 April.|$|E
5|$|The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but Integrity again {{ran into}} heavy weather off Cape Howe {{and was forced}} to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. <b>The</b> <b>cutter</b> entered what would later be known as Twofold Bay on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's {{surprise}} they discovered Contest, undamaged but unable to return to sea in the storm.|$|E
5|$|Batwoman also begins {{hunting down}} a crazed serial killer known as <b>the</b> <b>Cutter,</b> {{who has been}} abducting young women and cutting off parts of their face {{in order to create}} the perfect woman.

50|$|While the {{foregoing}} were primarily the materials that a machinist would be cutting, <b>the</b> <b>cutters</b> that <b>the</b> machinist uses must be harder and tougher than the materials to be cut.

5000|$|For {{this reason}} <b>the</b> <b>cutters</b> {{operating}} out of Boston were relieved of their usual patrol and cruising duties so as to assume full-time weather patrol. When <b>the</b> <b>cutters</b> were transferred to the Navy on 1 November 1941 the schedules of the weather patrol ships Mojave, , , , and [...] were not affected.|$|R
5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E
5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, displaying a tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 20 October 1793 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the French Revolutionary Wars fought off Cape Barfleur on the French coast of the English Channel. The early months of the war, which had begun in February, had seen a number of French frigates raiding British merchant shipping in the Channel, and HMS Crescent under Captain James Saumarez was deployed to watch the port of Cherbourg {{with the aim of}} disrupting the operations of the French frigates Réunion and Sémillante that were based in the harbour. On 20 October, Saumarez was waiting off Cape Barfleur for French movement when his lookout sighted Réunion and <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> Espérance approaching from open water.|$|E

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>the</b> <b>cutters</b> {{that produce}} counterbores are often also called counterbores; sometimes, to avoid ambiguity, <b>the</b> term counterbore <b>cutter</b> is used instead.|$|R
25|$|When {{planning}} the replacement for <b>the</b> Point-class <b>cutter,</b> designers {{took into consideration}} the need for different berthing arrangements that would accommodate a mixed-gender crew. Another important feature lacking on <b>the</b> Point-class <b>cutter</b> that was desired on a replacement was a stern launch ramp for the rapid deployment of <b>the</b> <b>cutter's</b> small boat for use in search-and-rescue missions and in law-enforcement work. Both of these requirements were designed into the Marine Protector-class that began replacing <b>the</b> Point-class <b>cutters</b> during <b>the</b> late 1990s. <b>The</b> last Point-class <b>cutter</b> was replaced in 2003.|$|R
5|$|The raking fire inflicted massive {{damage and}} {{casualties}} on the French ship, and although Dénian continued to resist for some time, his ship {{was no longer}} effectively able to respond once Saumarez had crossed his bow. Eventually, with Circe now rapidly approaching with a strengthening of the wind, Dénian accepted {{that he had no}} choice but to surrender his vessel after an engagement lasting two hours and ten minutes. <b>The</b> <b>cutter,</b> which had been ignored during the battle, successfully escaped to Cherbourg while the captain of Sémillante, anchored in the harbour, made a fruitless effort to reach the engagement, delayed by contrary wind and tides that prevented the frigate from sailing.|$|E
5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale <b>the</b> <b>cutter,</b> and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

5|$|Before the battle, Captain Charles Elliot, {{the chief}} {{superintendent}} of British trade in China, sailed to Kowloon in <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied by the}} schooner Pearl and a pinnace from HMS Volage. Upon encountering three Chinese junks, Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff with demands to re-allow the supply of provisions. After several hours of unsuccessful correspondence, Elliot delivered an ultimatum that if provisions were not received, the junks would be sunk. When it expired with no results, the British opened fire on the junks, which returned fire {{with support from the}} fort on shore. During the engagement, the larger junks pursued the British boats which were sailing away after running low on ammunition. But after replenishing their cartridges, the British re-engaged the ships, which retreated to their former position, ending the clash in a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|In his frigate HMS Phoenix, Halstead {{was able}} to cut the Batavian frigate Argo off from the shore {{and bring it to}} battle, forcing it to {{surrender}} in just 20 minutes as other British ships closed with the combat. The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan's fleet, pursued by the frigate HMS Pegasus and brig-sloop HMS Sylph. After a lengthy chase, Phoenix caught <b>the</b> <b>cutter</b> Duke of York, Sylph seized the brig Mercury, while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs, Echo and Gier ashore, where both were believed wrecked. Duncan's blockade of the Texel was instrumental in British control of the North Sea, and a year later it would achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E

50|$|By using sets of {{screens and}} cuts, this 2-1-2 {{formation}} can be maneuvered into a 1-3-1 formation, with the ball-handler on the wing. Once in position, the {{player in the}} low post (<b>the</b> second <b>cutter)</b> will set a screen for the ball-handler (<b>the</b> first <b>cutter).</b> <b>The</b> first <b>cutter</b> quickly passes <b>the</b> ball to the player on top at the perimeter (<b>the</b> fourth <b>cutter),</b> and then, {{depending on how the}} defense react, makes a cut to the basket either down the base line or over the top from the free throw line. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> fourth <b>cutter</b> will pass <b>the</b> ball to the player on the other wing (the fifth player), and quickly go down to the free throw lane and set a screen for <b>the</b> second <b>cutter.</b> <b>The</b> second <b>cutter</b> then make another cut across the free throw line. After the first two cuts are clear, the player in the middle at the free throw lane (<b>the</b> third <b>cutter),</b> who have been setting double screens for the previous two cuts, will now fake a step towards the basket and then break off to the top {{on the side of the}} circle, and <b>the</b> fourth <b>cutter</b> will go to the wing position initially taken by <b>the</b> first <b>cutter.</b> Note that at this point the players are again in the original 1-3-1 formation, except flipped to the other side.|$|R
