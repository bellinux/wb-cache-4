Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded.

Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

In the predecessor to this paper [A. B. Hopkins, F. H. Stillinger and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. E 81 041305 (2010) ], we described our method for finding <b>the</b> putative <b>densest</b> packings of N spheres in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd and presented those packings in R 2 for values of N up to N = 348. We analyze the properties and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> local packings in R 3 and employ knowledge of the Rmin(N), using methods applicable in any d, to construct both a realizability condition for pair correlation functions of sphere packings and an upper bound on the maximal density of infinite sphere packings. In R 3, we find wide variability in <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> local packings, including a multitude of packing symmetries such as perfect tetrahedral and imperfect icosahedral symmetry. We compare <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> local packings of N spheres near a central sphere to minimal-energy configurations of N+ 1 points interacting with short-range repulsive and long-range attractive pair potentials, e. g., 12 - 6 Lennard-Jones, and find that they are in general completely different, a result that has possible implications for nucleation theory. We also compare <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> local packings to finite subsets of stacking variants of <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> infinite packings in R 3 (the Barlow packings) and find that <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> local packings are almost always most similar, as measured by a similarity metric, to the subsets of Barlow packings with the smallest number of coordination shells measured about a single central sphere, e. g., a subset of the FCC Barlow packing. We additionally observe that <b>the</b> <b>densest</b> local packings are dominated by the spheres arranged with centers at precisely distance Rmin(N) from the fixed sphere's center.
