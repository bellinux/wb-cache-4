5|$|Birmingham is chiefly {{a product}} of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; its growth began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from its earlier history and those <b>that</b> <b>do</b> are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E

For the mortality outcome, we excluded trials in which eligibility for inclusion was unclear (based on ICU admission), and further explored odds ratio (OR) {{as an alternative to}} RR analysis. For the ICU LOS outcome, we excluded trials <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not directly report SDs.

5|$|Amanita exitialis is {{classified}} in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita.

Consistent with previous studies (Bruine de Bruin et al. 2007; Strough et al. 2008, 2011), individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy tended to be younger than those <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not. Additionally, they reported being significantly more bothered by emotional problems, and reported waiting longer to seek medical attention when they were feeling ill, than individuals <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not commit the sunk-cost fallacy. Moreover, individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy had significantly lower incomes. Examining {{the data from the}} BSI- 18, individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy displayed more signs of depression than those <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not. This relation, however, was not observed for somatization, or either of the two anxiety subscales. Similarly, individuals that committed the sunk-cost fallacy scored higher on the Binge Eating Scale than those <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not.|$|R
