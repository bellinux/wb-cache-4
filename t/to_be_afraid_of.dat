For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E

25|$|Hengist {{was struck}} by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the {{approach}} of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Aurelius, for he had brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near Sheffield), intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.|$|E
25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression {{is used by}} the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates {{is that it is a}} way for males to train females <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E

After praising God and blessing and wishing peace on Muhammad, Uthman invited {{the attention of}} the people to the commandment in the Quran requiring the people to obey God, His Apostle, and those in authority among them. He observed that the Muslims had been enjoined to settle all matters by mutual consultation. He said that he had kept the doors of consultation wide open. All the allegations that had been levelled against him had been duly explained by him and shown to be false. He had expressed his readiness to solve the legitimate grievances of the people, if any. He observed that under the circumstances it was uncharitable {{on the part of some}} persons to create disturbances in Mecca. He said that he was not afraid of death, but he did not want the Muslims to be guilty of bloodshed. To him the solidarity of the Muslim community was very dear and in order to prevent dissension among the Muslims he had instructed his supporters to refrain from violence. He wanted the people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> God and not to indulge in activities subversive of Islam. He pointed out that the foreign powers smarting under their defeat inflicted by the Muslim arms had sponsored some conspiracies to subvert Islam. He warned the people not to play in the hands of the enemies of Islam. He appealed to the rebels to retire from Madina. He wanted the people of Madina to support the cause of truth and justice and withhold their support from the rebels bent on mischief.|$|E

500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> whatever might come".|$|E

500|$|Feng's case {{became a}} focal point for {{newspaper}} editorials against China's one-child policy and abortion in general. Opponents of the one-child policy said the case is a potential turning point in the efforts to end the rule. [...] On June 26, Reuters said the story had sparked [...] "a firestorm domestically and around the world," [...] explaining that [...] "Feng Jianmei's abortion was portrayed in the Chinese and international press {{as an example of the}} extreme measures some officials would take to control China's population, even if it meant breaking Chinese law." [...] A story in The Wall Street Journal remarked that the case [...] "dramatize the harshness of the one-child policy." [...] The incident prompted Evan Osnos, the New Yorker writer, to create a feature piece titled [...] "Abortion and Politics in China." [...] Osnos said that [...] "the Feng case is emblematic of some of the most inflammatory issues on Chinese public life," [...] including money, government corruption, the household registration system, and of course family planning, and that [...] "the case is a dramatic demonstration of exactly why the Communist Party had reason <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the Internet." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared with Vitalogy and No Code, Yield {{represented}} {{more of a}} {{team effort}} between {{all members of the}} group. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for the albums Vitalogy and No Code; however, {{at the end of the}} No Code recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would be better for the other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that [...] "everybody took that to heart," [...] and O'Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder's reaction to the rest of the band's new material kept [...] "everybody energized about their place in the band." [...] Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder's attitude during the recording of Yield, stating, [...] "I used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him and not want to confront him on things ...

500|$|Itachi has ranked {{high in the}} Weekly Shonen Jump {{popularity}} {{polls for}} the series, continuously placing in the top 10. He was ranked in fifth position in the polls of 2011, his highest ranking to date. The character received generally positive reviews from several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media. IGN reader Jason Van Horn characterized Itachi as [...] "badass" [...] and jokingly mentioned {{that he is a}} character <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> since, in his first fight in the series, he does not make any remarkable move. He found that [...] "there is just something about the cold and numb Itachi," [...] that makes the viewer [...] "want to breakout in chills". IGN's Charles White liked the episode where the relationship between young Sasuke and Itachi is revealed, and hoped to see more of their past to resolve the mystery of Itachi's character commenting that learning about their [...] "past has been intriguing". NTT customers voted him as their tenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Itachi as one of his favorite characters from Naruto.|$|E
500|$|In September 1965 Mao {{agreed to}} {{rehabilitate}} Peng by promoting {{him to a}} position managing the industrial development of Southwest China, a project known as the Third Front. Peng initially refused this position, so Mao called him personally, and convinced Peng to accept it by suggesting that the condemnation of Peng at the Lushan Conference {{may have been a}} mistake. Peng was then appointed [...] "Deputy Commander of the Great Third Line of Construction in Southwest China" [...] and [...] "Third Secretary of the Control Commission of the CCP's Southwest Bureau". In practice, Peng's responsibilities were to oversee the industrial development of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet, with a focus on developing military industries and logistical networks. These positions were far below what Peng's position had been before 1959, but signaled his return to national politics. Peng worked energetically until August 1966, when the beginning of the Cultural Revolution had him recalled to Chengdu and the first Red Guards began patrolling the streets, violently attacking their perceived enemies. Peng's bodyguards warned him to avoid contact with the Red Guards, but Peng disregarded their advice, saying: [...] "a CCP member does not have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the masses." [...] Peng's disregard for personal danger and his confidence in the Chinese Communist Party {{made him one of the}} Cultural Revolution's first victims.|$|E
500|$|In {{making people}} of each {{ethnicity}} look alike, Spiegelman hoped {{to show the}} absurdity of dividing people along such lines. [...] Spiegelman has stated that [...] "these metaphors... are meant to self-destruct" [...] and [...] "reveal the inanity of the notion itself". [...] Professor Amy Hungerford saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor. [...] Rather, it signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their races—the gentile Françoise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims. [...] When asked what animal he would make Israeli Jews, Spiegelman suggests porcupines. [...] When Art visits his psychiatrist, the two wear mouse masks. [...] Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's making—in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, {{but by the time}} the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask. [...] In Maus, the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans. Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.|$|E
