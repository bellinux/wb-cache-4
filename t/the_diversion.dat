5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|HMS Lord Nelson {{was laid}} down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow on 18 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 4 September 1906.

When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly recognises the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E
5|$|General E. P. Scammon led the December expedition, {{which was}} a {{diversion}} with mixed results. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> was to draw Confederate forces away from a Union force led by General Averell, which was conducting a raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad near Salem, Virginia. Although Scammon captured Lewisburg, he soon retreated—making the situation for Averell more difficult.

5|$|HMS Agamemnon {{was ordered}} in 1904 {{and was the}} first warship built by the William Beardmore and Company's Dalmuir Naval Construction Works. She was laid down on 15 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 23 June 1906 before the dockyards themselves were finished. Her completion was greatly delayed by labour troubles and by <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> of the 12-inch (305mm) guns intended for her to expedite completion of HMS Dreadnought, and she was not finally completed until June 1908, six months before her sister Lord Nelson.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E
5|$|Operation Slapstick did {{not provide}} <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> General Eisenhower had hoped for.

Heidrich had expected to be confronted by an overwhelming Allied force and had withdrawn his units north, although he endeavoured to delay the Allied advance where possible by ambushes and roadblocks. The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E

On {{the first day of the}} road works, there were traffic jams of more than 4 km at the exits leading to <b>the</b> <b>diversions.</b> On <b>the</b> <b>diversions</b> themselves, traffic collapsed completely at times.

In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in violation of a 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diversion</b> {{of three}} {{quarters}} of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted Britain to reconsider its grand strategy.

The second was at Kibbutz Gezer from where <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> attacks had been launched. A force the strength of a battalion, made up of Legionnaires and irregulars and supported by a dozen armoured vehicles, attacked the kibbutz in the morning.

5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Delays in {{shipping}} Spitfires to Australia disrupted No.1 Wing's formation. In late June 1942 the British Government diverted all but six of {{the initial}} 48 aircraft to Egypt to reinforce the three RAF Spitfire squadrons there after the German victory in the Battle of Gazala; most of these aircraft were allocated to No. 92 Squadron RAF with the remainder forming a reserve to replace future losses. The Australian Government protested against this action, but reluctantly accepted it after Churchill refused to counteract <b>the</b> <b>diversion.</b> During the same period, {{the men of the}} three Spitfire squadrons sailed from Liverpool on board the MV Stirling Castle on 21June and disembarked at Melbourne with the six remaining Spitfires on 13August. A shipment of 43 Spitfires left England on 4 August and arrived in Australia in late October, and further deliveries continued to be made until June 1945.|$|E
5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war in December 1941 the {{decision}} was made to bring the 6th Division back to bolster the Allied defences in the Pacific, and the 2/3rd Battalion left the Middle East on 10 March 1942, aboard the steamer Orontes. The original intention was that they would be sent to reinforce Java; however, while they were at sea concerns about a Japanese attack on Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) prompted <b>the</b> <b>diversion</b> of the 16th and 17th Brigades to Colombo, and they arrived there on 21 March. The freighter Ben Rennies, carrying the battalion's vehicles, arrived shortly afterwards and the 2/3rd took up defensive positions in the southeast part of the island, which was considered to be the most likely location for a Japanese invasion force to land.|$|E

Fish populations in two irrigation diversions were sampled and fish were collected during a one year period to determine habitat suitability, the relative abundance, and fate of fishes.

Irrigation diversions generally did not provide habitat suitable for fish and did not support large fish communities.
