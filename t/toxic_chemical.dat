5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> runoff {{ingested}} {{by their}} prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E

40|$|<b>Toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> used {{in product}} design and {{manufacturing}} are grave concerns {{due to their}} significant impact on human health. Sustainable material selections are needed by industry to reduce the overall impact of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in both design and manufacturing. In this paper, we integrate the human health impact assessment into standard material selection process for developing a sustainable material selection metric for decision support in design and manufacturing. A schematic method is presented for characterizing and benchmarking the human health impact of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> A case study is performed on six <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> used as solvents in semiconductor manufacturing. Reliability of the schematic benchmarking results is checked and validated {{by comparing the results}} with that of conventional Human Toxicity Potential (HTP) method...|$|R
50|$|In 1986, the United States {{enacted the}} Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Pollution Prevention Act, which {{required}} companies releasing <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> {{to report to}} the EPA when and how much of the chemical was being spread.

5|$|Use of CS in war is {{prohibited}} {{under the terms}} of the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by most nations in 1993 with all but five other nations signing between 1994 and 1997. The reasoning behind the prohibition is pragmatic: use of CS by one combatant could easily trigger retaliation with much more <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> weapons such as nerve agents. Only four nations have not signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and are therefore unhindered by restrictions on the use of CS gas: Angola, Egypt, North Korea and Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical.</b> The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E

40|$|A simple nutrient–phytoplankton {{model is}} {{proposed}} and analyzed {{in the presence}} of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> released by toxin-producing phytoplankton (TPP) to understand the dynamics of seasonally recurring bloom phenomena. We observe that the presence of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> helps to explain the bloom phenomenon. We have further studied our proposed system by varying the toxin liberation rate. Our model displays a wide range of dynamical behaviours, from simple cyclical blooms to irregular chaotic blooms. We also observe skipping phenomenon. The effect of <b>toxic</b> <b>chemicals</b> released by TPP cannot, thus, be ignored in ‘bottom-up’ models...|$|R

That same year, a twenty-five foot area crumbled exposing <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> drums, which then filled with water during rainstorms.

Ethylene glycol is listed as a <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> requiring care in handling and disposal.|$|E
25|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a nerve agent because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Tabun {{is the first of}} the G-series nerve agents along with GB (sarin), GD (soman) and GF (cyclosarin).|$|E

25|$|Serious {{environmental}} {{threats from}} plastic {{have been suggested}} {{in the light of}} the increasing presence of microplastics in the marine food chain along with many highly <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> pollutants that accumulate in plastics. They also accumulate in larger fragmented pieces of plastic called nurdles. In the 1960s the latter were observed in the guts of seabirds, and since then have been found in increasing concentration. In 2009, it was estimated that 10% of modern waste was plastics, although estimates vary according to region. Meanwhile, 50-80% of debris in marine areas is plastic.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{estimated}} {{material damage}} from the revolutionary war to be US$480million. The FSLN took over a nation plagued by malnutrition, disease, and pesticide contaminations. Lake Managua was considered dead because of decades of pesticide runoff, <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> pollution from lakeside factories, and untreated sewage. Soil erosion and dust storms were also a problem in Nicaragua at the time due to deforestation. To tackle these crises, the FSLN created the Nicaraguan Institute of Natural Resources and the Environment. It was created 10 years after the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} tabun appear slowly when tabun is absorbed {{through the skin}} rather than inhaled. A victim may absorb a lethal dose quickly, {{although}} death may be delayed for one to two hours. A person's clothing can release the <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Inhaled lethal dosages kill in one to ten minutes, and liquid absorbed through the eyes kills almost as fast. However, people who experience mild to moderate exposure to tabun can recover completely, if treated {{almost as soon as}} exposure occurs. The LCt50 for tabun is about 400mg-min/m3.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{environmental}} benefits of using recycled material, plastic ties usually replace timber ties soaked in creosote, the latter being a <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical,</b> and are themselves recyclable. Hybrid plastic railroad ties and composite ties are used in other rail applications such as underground mining operations, industrial zones, humid environments and densely populated areas. Hybrid railroad ties are also used to be partly exchanged with rotten wooden ties, which will result in continuous track stiffness. Hybrid plastic ties and composite ties also offer benefits on bridges and viaducts, because they lead to better distribution of forces and reduction of vibrations into respectively bridge girders or the ballast. This is due to better damping properties of hybrid plastic ties and composite ties, which will decrease the intensity of vibrations {{as well as the}} sound production.|$|E
25|$|Bags {{of cement}} {{routinely}} have {{health and safety}} warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly alkaline, but the setting process is exothermic. As a result, wet cement is strongly caustic (water pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe skin burns if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with mucous membranes can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause allergic dermatitis. Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent chromate (CrO42−) into trivalent chromium (Cr3+), a less <b>toxic</b> <b>chemical</b> species. Cement users need also to wear appropriate gloves and protective clothing.|$|E
