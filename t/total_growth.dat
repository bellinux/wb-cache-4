25|$|Muslims in India have a {{much higher}} total {{fertility}} rate (TFR) {{compared to that of}} other religious communities in the country. Because of higher birthrates the percentage of Muslims in India has risen from about 10% in 1951 to 14.23% by 2013. The Muslim population growth rate from 1991-01 was higher by more than 10% of the <b>total</b> <b>growth</b> compared to that of Hindus. However, since 1991, the largest decline in fertility rates among all religious groups in India has occurred among Muslims. The Population Growth rate is also attributable to the fact that majority of Muslim populations are concentrated in the states that are lagging behind in social reforms and services which have shown higher birth rates than other states. However, the Sachar Committee Report shows that the Muslim Population Growth has slowed down and will be on par with national averages. The Sachar Committee Report estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilise at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100.|$|E
25|$|Until 1970, Ibadan was {{the largest}} city in Sub-Saharan Africa by surface. In 1952, it was {{estimated}} that the total area of the city was approximately 103.8km2 However, only 36.2km2 was built up. This meant that the remaining 67km2 were devoted to non-urban uses, such as farmlands, river floodplains, forest reserves and water bodies. These “non-urban land uses” disappeared in the 1960s: an aerial photograph in 1973 revealed that the urban land-scape had completely spread over about 100km2. The land area increased from 136km2 in 1981 to 210–240km2 in 1988-89 (Areola, 1994: 101). By the year 2000, it is estimated that Ibadan covered 400km2. The growth of the built-up area {{during the second half of}} the 20th century (from 40km2 in the 1950s to 250km2 in the 1990s) shows clearly that there has been an underestimate of the <b>total</b> <b>growth</b> of the city. In the 1980s, the Ibadan-Lagos expressway generated the greatest urban sprawl (east and north of the city), followed by the Eleiyele expressway (west of the city).

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to measure the}} productivity performance of the Indian fertilizer industry at the aggregate level, with adjustment for variations in capacity utilization {{during the period from}} 1979 - 80 to 2003 - 04. Using a translog specification, our econometric analysis reveals a decelerating trend in <b>total</b> factor productivity <b>growth</b> resulting in negative impact of economic reforms on the Indian fertilizer industry. The study also indicates a declining trend of economic capacity utilization suggesting the adverse impact of liberalization after the mid 90 ’s, due to slow increases in actual output; this probably results from stagnated demand and rapid expansion of capacity {{as a result of the}} abolition of the licensing rule consequent to economic reforms. <b>Total</b> output <b>growth</b> in the Indian fertilizer industry is found to be mainly as a result of inputaccumulation rather than productivity driven.

2500|$|The Department of Health and Human Services, {{primarily}} Medicare, {{funds the}} vast majority of residency training in the US. [...] This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education or DME payments. [...] Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education or IME payments, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals that is tied to admissions of Medicare patients in exchange for training resident physicians in certain selected specialties. [...] Overall funding levels, however, have remained frozen over the last ten years, creating a bottleneck in the training of new physicians in the US, according to the AMA. On the other hand, some argue that Medicare subsidies for training residents simply provide surplus revenue for hospitals which recoup their training costs by paying residents salaries (roughly $45,000 per year) that are far below the residents' market value. Nicholson concludes that residency bottlenecks are not caused by a Medicare funding cap, but rather, by Residency Review Committees (which approve new residencies in each specialty) which seek {{to limit the number of}} specialists in their field to maintain high incomes. In any case, hospitals trained residents long before Medicare provided additional subsidies for that purpose. [...] A large number of teaching hospitals fund resident training to increase the supply of residency slots, leading to the modest 4% <b>total</b> <b>growth</b> in slots from 1998–2004.|$|E
