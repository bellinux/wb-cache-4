5|$|Although Mullum Malarum {{opened to}} a <b>tepid</b> box office {{reception}} at its 15 August 1978 (Independence Day) release, positive reviews from critics and favourable {{word of mouth}} helped make it a success. Rajinikanth's performance as Kali received unanimous praise, and it is widely considered the best performance of his career. The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Film– Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize (for Rajinikanth).|$|E
5|$|An Independence Day {{video game}} was {{released}} in February 1997 for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC, each version receiving mostly <b>tepid</b> reviews. The multi-view shooter game contains various missions to perform, with {{the ultimate goal of}} destroying the aliens' primary weapon. A wireless mobile version {{was released in}} 2005. A computer game entitled ID4 Online was released in 2000.|$|E
5|$|It was {{released}} in Israel on 27 March 2008, and it received a <b>tepid</b> response from Israeli audiences. It {{was released}} internationally through IFC Films on 17 April 2009. From there, the film has achieved critical success and it has received nominations for several awards such as Best Actress and Best Screenwriter at the 21st European Film Awards.|$|E
5|$|Original members Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden {{and drummer}} Ryan Dusick first came {{together}} as Kara's Flowers in 1994, {{while they were}} still in high school. The band self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a <b>tepid</b> response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college.|$|E
5|$|Woman of the Year was {{followed}} by an adaptation of John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat (1942) which met with a <b>tepid</b> response. MGM {{did not hesitate to}} repeat the teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery Keeper of the Flame (1942). Despite a weak critical reception the film was a popular success, outgrossing its predecessor and confirming the strength of the partnership.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to a 5–11 {{record in}} 1995. Much {{of the blame}} for the Giants' poor {{performance}} was placed on Brown. He put up lackluster numbers for the second straight year. Though the Giants defense still played well, and young players like Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead began to emerge,* Freeman, Mike. , The New York Times, October 30, 1995, accessed December 6, 2010. the Giants inspired <b>tepid</b> interest league-wide and sent no players to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in <b>tepid</b> water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} phase of Malliswari lasted {{for two years}} and the film was released on 20December 1951. It opened to a <b>tepid</b> response at the box office, but soon saw a growth in ticket sales due to favourable word of mouth. It grossed over 0.8 million and was commercially successful. Malliswari was later screened at the 9th International Film Festival of India and the 1952 Peking film festival, making it the first Telugu film to be screened in an international film festival. Narasimha Reddy planned to dub the film into English, but backed out due to budget considerations.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany conquered Poland in September 1939, it {{was faced}} with the {{disposition}} of the large Jewish population. In view of the German populace's <b>tepid</b> response to the orchestrated violence of Kristallnacht, the Nazis perceived an urgent need for films that would move German popular sentiment {{in favor of the}} Nazi Final Solution to the 'Jewish question'. Frustrated with the delays on the Jud Süß project, Goebbels ordered Fritz Hippler, the head of his film department, to sack Brauer and bring in Veit Harlan to take over as director.|$|E
5|$|American pop {{rock band}} Maroon 5 has {{released}} six studio albums, three live albums, two compilation albums, one remix album, three extended plays (EPs), 18 singles, six promotional singles, and 23 music videos. The group originally formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers {{while they were}} still attending high school. With a line-up of Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick, they released their independent album, We Like Digging?. In 1997, they signed to Reprise Records and released an album, The Fourth World. After a <b>tepid</b> response to the album, the band parted with their record label and attended college. In 2001, the band regrouped and added James Valentine to the lineup, and pursued a new direction under the name Maroon 5.|$|E
5|$|Hawke {{starred in}} the 2005 action thriller Assault on Precinct 13, a loose remake of John Carpenter's 1976 film of the same title, with an updated plot. The film {{received}} ambivalent reviews; some critics praised the dark swift feel of the film, while others compared it unfavorably to John Carpenter's original. Hawke also appeared that year in the political crime thriller Lord of War, playing an Interpol agent chasing an arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage. In 2006, Hawke was cast in a supporting role in Fast Food Nation, directed by Richard Linklater based on Eric Schlosser's best-selling 2001 book. The same year Hawke directed his second feature, The Hottest State, based on his eponymous 1996 novel. The film was released in August 2007 to a <b>tepid</b> reception.|$|E
5|$|The Viva Piñata {{team was}} a model for {{productivity}} and regular output within Rare and Microsoft Studios. Though compared to the 12-person teams behind earlier Rare games, the company's Xbox 360 development teams consisted of 50 to 60 people. The Viva Piñata team included about 50 people at its zenith. Microsoft transitioned its development teams to use its XNA package to streamline and reduce duplication in engineering efforts. Microsoft pressured the Viva Piñata development team to keep the game's themes children-friendly, as the parent company planned for the game and resulting franchise to increase the market appeal of their Xbox 360. In 2006, a Microsoft Games executive called the game its most important franchise. But its reception was <b>tepid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{received}} a <b>tepid</b> response from sports fans, and provoked criticism from media members. It continued into January 1999, threatening {{cancellation of the}} entire season. After division within the players union, however, NBPA executive director Billy Hunter reached an agreement with NBA commissioner David Stern on January 6 to end the work stoppage. Quickly ratified by the owners and players, the deal was signed later in January, ending the lockout after 204 days. The settlement provided for maximum salaries for players and a pay scale for first-year players. In the months after the lockout, television ratings and ticket sales declined during the 50-game season, and both remained below pre-lockout levels in subsequent seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the {{southern}} state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a <b>tepid</b> commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran {{for more than five years}} at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{critically}} appreciated for its lyrical content and composition, and was declared by reviewers {{as one of}} Madonna's most personal efforts; however, some critics felt it was <b>tepid</b> and lacklustre compared to other tracks from Ray of Light. In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was {{due to lack of}} airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Walton {{revised the}} score of Troilus and Cressida, and the opera was staged at Covent Garden in 1976. Once again it {{was plagued by}} misfortune while in preparation. Walton was in poor health; Previn, who was to conduct, also fell ill; and the tenor chosen for Troilus pulled out. As in 1954, the critics were {{generally}} <b>tepid.</b> Some of Walton's final artistic endeavours were {{in collaboration with the}} film-maker Tony Palmer. Walton took part in Palmer's profile of him, At the Haunted End of the Day, in 1981, and in 1982 Walton and his wife played the cameo roles of King Frederick Augustus and Queen Maria of Saxony in Palmer's nine-hour film Wagner.|$|E
5|$|Since Woman of the Year, Hepburn had {{committed}} to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less {{for the remainder of}} the decade than she had done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a <b>tepid</b> response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record number of tickets over Easter-weekend 1945.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations lacked {{an armed}} force {{of its own}} and {{depended}} on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action {{on behalf of the}} League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially <b>tepid</b> to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, {{while at the same time}} advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the <b>tepid</b> {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
5|$|The Report was {{received}} warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and {{distributed in the}} state, but {{there was not much}} public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was <b>tepid.</b> Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1993, Carey began conceptualizing Music Box (1993), {{which became}} the highest selling album of Carey's career. For her past two albums, Carey's {{creative}} choices were heavily controlled by her label Columbia Records, {{as well as her}} husband and CEO of the company, Tommy Mottola. Carey's previous effort, Emotions (1991), drew influence from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music, and failed to achieve the same success matched by her debut album. Following its <b>tepid</b> commercial performance, Columbia aimed for Music Box to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. Music Box went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and earned its place among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey more control over the music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed is an indie action video game, {{created by}} {{developer}} Benedict Fritz and designer Greg Wohlwend, {{in which the}} player balances a rolling seed on an ascending, horizontally slanted vine past procedurally generated obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. It is based on the mechanical arcade game Ice Cold Beer and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a <b>tepid</b> critical reception for the game's slow sales, but were proud of their work.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, {{reviews for}} the album were mixed, with {{criticism}} directed towards both the new {{material and the}} decision to include only Carey's number one hits in the United States. While receiving <b>tepid</b> reviews from music critics, the album became a large commercial success throughout the world. It debuted at number four on Billboard 200, number one in Japan, and in the top-ten throughout almost every major music market around the globe. #1's was certified five-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of five million copies throughout the United States. Aside from the US, the album experienced its strongest sales in Japan, where the album sold 3,250,000 copies {{in the first three}} months after its release. The album was certified the triple-million award, and currently remains the best-selling album of all-time in Japan by a non-Asian artist. In Europe, #1's was certified double-platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), denoting shipments of two million copies throughout the continent.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} discontinued incentives in 2014 amid {{a limited}} public charging infrastructure and <b>tepid</b> reception. Further, many Italian houses were equipped with electric contracts allowing only 3kW of peak consumption, making home charging of electric cars impractical.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the recent}} gains, investors remain wary of making {{placements}} in second-tier {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs). Purchasers of new issues were disappointed after prices fell in numerous medium-sized companies that made offerings in 1996 and 1997. IPO activity in Mexico remains <b>tepid</b> and the market for second-tier IPOs is barely visible. There were three IPOs in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{faced an}} ugly dilemma. If he {{rejected}} Dred Scott, {{he would lose}} Southern support he needed for the presidential election of 1860. If he embraced Dred Scott, he would lose northern support. He tried to avoid both hazards, issuing a <b>tepid</b> endorsement of the decision, while continuing to assert popular sovereignty without explicitly saying the Court was wrong.|$|E
25|$|Fitzgerald {{considered}} Tender Is the Night to be {{his greatest}} work. Although it received a <b>tepid</b> response upon release, it has grown in acclaim {{over the years and}} is widely regarded as among Fitzgerald's best books. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked the novel 28th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Doherty and Barât {{remained}} out {{of contact}} for several months after the Libertines had ended, due to Doherty's spiralling drug abuse. Members of the band reunited several times on stage through the years to play Libertines songs, but talks of a reunion remained <b>tepid</b> as Doherty and Barât concentrated on their respective bands Babyshambles and Dirty Pretty Things. A retrospective collection Time for Heroes - The Best of The Libertines was released in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Alberta Liberals were <b>tepid</b> {{to support}} the Independent Citizens' Association led by John Percy Page. They wanted the Independents to remain {{independent}} and were against having a new party formed based on the coalition. The Liberals maintained the party organization by keeping the Constituency Associations and Party Executive Intact. After Gray resigned the leadership on April 19, 1941 to accept a patronage position the party did not officially replace him as leader until James Prowse in 1947.|$|E
25|$|After {{five months}} of fighting, Japan {{established}} the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, and installed last emperor of China, Puyi, as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the League of Nations for help. The League's investigation led to {{the publication of the}} Lytton Report, condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country was willing to take action against Japan beyond <b>tepid</b> censure.|$|E
25|$|The WAA unsurprisingly {{dedicated}} a {{great deal}} of its political effort to pushing Congress and the Roosevelt Administration to reverse cuts to the WPA budget and to renew financial commitment to relief efforts on behalf of the unemployed. A National Jobs March was called by the WAA during the summer of 1937, but the response was <b>tepid,</b> with only 2,500 people joining the temporary city constructed in WPA-supplied tents near the Lincoln Memorial. Steady rain further demoralized the strikers, who quietly demonstrated outside the White House and Capitol before fading away.|$|E
25|$|The lackluster {{sales and}} <b>tepid</b> reviews, {{combined}} with the lineup changes, painted {{a picture of a}} band in decline. The quick departure of Cooper and Lichens, joined by longtime bassist Cates, did not help. Schlitt said Cates cited fatigue with the touring lifestyle, but that he fired Lichens and Cooper over differences about the band's musical direction and unhappiness with the possibility of recording a second praise album. Lonnie Chapin replaced Cates on bass, while two members of Schlitt's solo band, Kevin Brandow (guitar and keyboards) and Pete Orta (guitars), filled the remaining slots.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{his first}} film, From the Hip, which {{received}} poor reviews, Kelley wrote and produced three other films. 1996's To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday, a romance, co-starring his wife, Michelle Pfeiffer, received <b>tepid</b> critical and box office reception. In 1999, came two films: Lake Placid, {{a combination of}} suspense, horror and comedy, and Mystery, Alaska, about a fictional small-town ice hockey team that plays {{a game against the}} New York Rangers of the National Hockey League. Neither movie did well with either the critics or the audience.|$|E
25|$|Some limited {{evidence}} supports sponging or bathing feverish children with <b>tepid</b> water. The {{use of a}} fan or air conditioning may somewhat reduce the temperature and increase comfort. If the temperature reaches the extremely high level of hyperpyrexia, aggressive cooling is required (generally produced mechanically via conduction by applying numerous ice packs across most of the body or direct submersion in ice water). In general, people are advised to keep adequately hydrated. Whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illnesses such as the common cold is not known.|$|E
25|$|His 2000 film Brother was {{deliberately}} {{intended to be}} a hit abroad. Shot in Los Angeles, it starred Kitano as a deposed and exiled Tokyo yakuza setting up a drug empire in Los Angeles {{with the aid of a}} local gangster played by Omar Epps. However, the film met with <b>tepid</b> international response. Although in Japan it did better financially than Hana-bi. Dolls in 2002 had Kitano directing but not starring in a romantic drama with three different stories about undying love, and was loosely based on a bunraku play.|$|E
