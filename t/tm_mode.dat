The waveguide is consisting of an isotropic dielectric slab bounded by hyperbolic media. Some differences between {{the features of the}} waveguide under consideration and conventional ones are obtained. In particular, in the case of hyperbolic waveguide <b>TM</b> <b>modes</b> have two cutoff frequencies. As a result the number of modes is limited.

As the frequency approaches zero, the longitudinal component of field diminishes and the mode asymptotically approaches the TEM mode. Imageline thus shares the property {{of being able to}} propagate waves at arbitrarily low frequencies with the TEM format lines, although it cannot actually support a TEM wave. However, imageline is not a suitable technology at lower frequencies. Imageline must be precisely machined as surface roughness increases radiation losses.|$|R

50|$|In {{radio-frequency}} applications up {{to a few}} gigahertz, {{the wave}} propagates primarily in the transverse electric magnetic (TEM) mode, {{which means that the}} electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation. However, above a certain cutoff frequency, transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) modes can also propagate, as they do in a waveguide. It is usually undesirable to transmit signals above the cutoff frequency, since it may cause multiple modes with different phase velocities to propagate, interfering with each other. The outer diameter is roughly inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency. A propagating surface-wave mode that does not involve or require the outer shield but only a single central conductor also exists in coax but this mode is effectively suppressed in coax of conventional geometry and common impedance. Electric field lines for this <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> have a longitudinal component and require line lengths of a half-wavelength or longer.|$|E

50|$|While Goubau-Line, which {{requires}} a conductor having an outer dielectric or special surface conditioning provided to reduce the velocity of the wave on the conductor, has long been known, this more general transverse-magnetic (<b>TM)</b> <b>mode</b> does not have this limitation. E-Line {{is similar to the}} Goubau-Line in its use of launchers to couple to and from a radially symmetric wave propagating in the space around a single conductor but different in that it can operate on insulation-free conductors, including those that are polished and completely unfeatured. The propagation velocity of the wave is not reduced and is essentially that of a wave traveling in the same medium {{in the absence of any}} conductor at all. Furthermore, practical launchers need not have a cross-section that is a large portion of a wavelength. Energy associated with the wave is confined to a region determined by the diameter and geometry of the conductor rather than the wavelength of the propagating signal. The Launcher has a low frequency cutoff limited by launcher length along the conductor.|$|E
30|$|Light {{emitted from}} QWs has two optical {{polarization}} modes: transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes. In the LED structures grown on a c-plane substrate, the polarization {{direction of the}} TE (or <b>TM)</b> <b>mode</b> corresponds to the electric field direction perpendicular (or parallel) to the c-axis. Therefore, the TE-polarized light propagates in both the horizontal and vertical directions. However, the TM-polarized light propagates mainly in the horizontal direction. Then, LEE of the TE mode will be much {{higher than that of}} the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> because the TM-polarized light undergoes strong effects of total internal reflection (TIR) due to the large incident angle on the interface of an LED chip. Consequently, LEE will decrease significantly as the contribution of the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> increases. In most LEDs operating in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range, TE mode emission is dominant. In AlGaN QWs, however, light is emitted as either TE or <b>TM</b> <b>mode,</b> and the portion of the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> increases as the Al composition increases or emission wavelength decreases[6 – 8]. The increasing contribution of the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> with decreasing wavelengths can be attributed to another cause of low LEE in AlGaN deep UV LEDs.|$|E
40|$|When {{the charge}} {{carriers}} are doped into graphene, {{not only the}} transverse magnetic (<b>TM)</b> <b>mode</b> of ordinary two-dimensional electron gas is supported, but the Dirac nature of fermions in graphene provides a unique chance for the transverse electric (TE) mode [S. A. Mikhailov, K. Ziegler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 016803 (2007) ] to propagate. We study the effect of Coulomb interactions in the propagation of TM and TE modes in graphene. While the TE mode is not affected by (longitudinal) Coulomb interactions, the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> is strongly affected by the Coulomb interactions. Within the random phase approximation {{we find that the}} particle-hole fluctuations in the triplet channel play a crucial role and generically lower the energy of <b>TM</b> <b>mode.</b> For the undoped graphene the reduction in the energy of <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> caused by triplet particle-hole fluctuations pushes it out of the continuum of free particle-hole excitations, thereby protecting it from damping.

30|$|As well known, the {{two modes}} of {{electromagnetic}} inductions {{are available for}} 2 -D cases: the transverse magnetic (<b>TM)</b> <b>mode</b> and the transverse electric (TE) mode (e.g., page 37 in Chave and Jones 2012). In the <b>TM</b> <b>mode,</b> the magnetic field points in the strike of 2 -D structure and the electric field lies in the plane orthogonal to strike. The TE mode has the complementary set, with electric field in the strike direction and the magnetic field orthogonal to the strike. In this study, I focus the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> induction for evaluation of the coastal effect on GIE. As typically shown in Vozoff (1972), the apparent resistivity at a frequency rapidly changes at a vertical contact of conductivity heterogeneity, similar to coastline. Since the amplitude of magnetic field is common at the earth’s surface in the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> theoretically, the rapid change means less-continuous electrical field across the vertical contact. On the contrary, in the TE mode, the apparent resistivity gradually changes across the vertical contact. It means that the TE-mode electrical field can be approximately inferred by interpolation of calculated results on the 1 -D models. Therefore, the GIE estimation in the <b>TM</b> <b>mode</b> is more meaningful for the 2 -D studies.|$|E

In addition, LEE of nanorod LED structures was observed to have strong dependence on structural parameters such as the diameter of a nanorod and the p-GaN thickness, which could be attributed to the formation of resonant modes inside the nanorod structure. It was found that high LEE of > 50 % could be achieved through the optimization of the nanorod LED structures for both the TE and TM modes.
