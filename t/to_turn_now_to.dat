60|$|<b>To</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> other matters, {{there are}} two things upon which it should seem fitting to dilate {{somewhat}} more largely in this place,--the Yankee character and the Yankee dialect. And, first, of the Yankee character, which has wanted neither open maligners, nor even more dangerous enemies in the persons of those unskilful painters who have given to it that hardness, angularity, and want of proper perspective, which, in truth, belonged, not to their subject, but to their own niggard and unskilful pencil.|$|E
60|$|Rousseau's {{name has}} never lacked fanatical partisans {{down to our}} own day, and Diderot was {{attacked}} {{by some of the}} earliest of them for his note of disparagement. The first part of the Confessions--all that Diderot ever saw--appeared in 1782, and in the same year Diderot published a second edition of the Essay on Claudius and Nero, so augmented by replies, inserted in season and out of season, to the diatribes of the party of Rousseau, that as it now stands the reader may well doubt whether the substance and foundation of the book is an apology for Seneca or a vindication of Denis Diderot. As Grimm said, we have to make up our minds to see the author suddenly pass from the palace of the Cæsars to the garret of MM. Royou, Grosier, and company; from Paris to Rome, and from Rome back again to Paris; from the reign of Claudius to the reign of Lewis XV.; from the college of the Sorbonne to the college of the augurs; <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> the masters of the world, and now to the yelping curs of literature; to see him in his dramatic enthusiasm making the one speak and the others answer; apostrophising himself and apostrophising his readers, and leaving them often enough in perplexity as to the personage who is speaking and the personage whom he addresses.[185] We may agree with Grimm that this gives an air of originality to the performance, but such originality is of a kind to displease the serious student, without really attracting the few readers who have a taste for rebelling against the pedantries of literary form. We become confused by the long strain of uncertainty whether we are reading about the Roman Emperor or the French King; about Seneca, Burrhus, and Thrasea, or Turgot, Malesherbes, and Necker.|$|E

40|$|Having {{discussed}} necessary basic {{technologies and}} information visualization techniques in Chapter 2, we need <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> our attention <b>now</b> <b>to</b> {{requirements for the}} research work {{to be carried out}} in connection with the present thesis. A number of related projects will be presented and analyzed in this context. The deficits found in existing applications will be used to define new requirements, leading, in the end, to the formulation of more detailed objectives of this thesis. The projects presented in the following have in common, that they provide a framework for applications, which map database content to visual content using three-dimensional metaphors. They are presented from a rather conceptual view without going into very much technical detail. In section 3. 7 we will comment on some interesting and relevant technical achievements of the projects described. The order in which the projects are presented roughly reflects their chronology. 3. 1 Metaphoric Information Visualization Systems The following information visualization systems have in common, that they use a fixed and wellspecified graphical 3 D metaphor to map information objects to. The described, systems, however, allow for configurable definition of the mapping from information objects to visual properties of the graphical metaphorical objects...|$|R
60|$|However, he {{was bound}} in all {{courtesy}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his attention <b>now</b> <b>to</b> the show {{which had been}} prepared in his honor, and which was really well enough worth seeing and hearing. The English were, in those days, an altogether dramatic people; ready and able, as in Bideford that day, to extemporize a pageant, a masque, or any effort of the Thespian art short of the regular drama. For they were, in the first place, even down to the very poorest, a well-fed people, with fewer luxuries than we, but more abundant necessaries; and while beef, ale, and good woollen clothes could be obtained in plenty, without overworking either body or soul, men had time to amuse themselves in something more intellectual than mere toping in pot-houses. Moreover, the half century after the Reformation in England was one not merely of new intellectual freedom, but of immense animal good spirits. After years of dumb confusion and cruel persecution, a breathing time had come: Mary and the fires of Smithfield had vanished together like a hideous dream, and the mighty shout of joy which greeted Elizabeth's entry into London, was the key-note of fifty glorious years; {{the expression of a}} new-found strength and freedom, which vented itself at home in drama and in song; abroad in mighty conquests, achieved with the laughing recklessness of boys at play.|$|R
6000|$|Three nights after when I {{was in bed}} I {{became very}} lucidly awake--it must have been {{about two or three}} in the morning--and the vision of life {{returned}} to me, with that same effect of enlargement and illumination. It was as if the great stillness that is behind and above and around the world of sense did in some way communicate with me. It bade me rouse my spirit and go on with the thoughts and purposes that had been stirring and proliferating in my mind when I had returned to England from the Cape. [...] "Dismiss your passion." [...] But I urged that that I could not do; there was the thought of Mary subjugated and weeping, the smarting memory of injury and defeat, the stains of subterfuge and discovery, the aching separation. No matter, the stillness answered, in the end all that is just to temper you for your greater uses.... I cannot forget, I insisted. Do not forget, but for the present this leads you no whither; this chapter has ended; dismiss it and <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> those other things. You are not only Stephen Stratton who fell into adultery; in these silences he is a little thing and far away; here and with me you are Man--Everyman--in this round world in which your lot has fallen. But Mary, I urged, to forget Mary is a treason, an ingratitude, seeing that she loved me. But the stillness did not command me to forget her, but only <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> my face <b>now</b> <b>to</b> the great work that lies before mankind. And that work? That work, so far as your share goes, is first to understand, to solve, and then to achieve, to work out in the measure of yourself that torment of pity and that desire for order and justice which together saturate your soul. Go about the world, embrue yourself with life, make use of that confusedly striving brain that I have lifted so painfully out of the deadness of matter....|$|R

40|$|One {{thing that}} American {{newspaper}} readers can’t help noticing—no matter which section matters most to them—is that people, objects, and images are circulating between China and the West at a dizzying pace. In 2007 alone, business reporters told of tainted food and dangerous toys coming from East to West, while their colleagues covering entertainment reported that film crews were {{heading in the}} opposite direction to shoot “Survivor: China. ” Sports fans got reports of U. S. athletes preparing for the Beijing Games as well as articles about Yao Ming moving {{back and forth across the}} Pacific, to shoot baskets in Houston and get married in Shanghai. What’s more, on a single recent Sunday (December 2, 2007), the Los Angeles Times greeted subscribers like me with not just one but two headline-grabbing stories about 21 st century tourism with Chinese characteristics. On the front page, a story titled “Opening the Door for China” described changed visa rules that are likely to “unleash a new wave of tourism,” bringing Chinese visitors streaming into Southern California in record number to go to theme parks, stay at hotels and shop in the heavily Mandarin-speaking San Gabriel Valley, and buy herbal medicines and brand name luxury goods (confident, as they wouldn’t be at home, that they’ll get the real things, not fakes). The cover of the Travel section, meanwhile, showed snowcapped mountain peaks topped by large white lettering spelling out “REVVED UP for the SILK ROAD,” with smaller type above reading “Countdown to the 2008 Olympics” (a reminder of the media frenzy and big upsurge in West-to-East tourism predicted for this year). The increasing intertwining of China and the West—and the excitement and anxiety it’s generating—has inspired breathless forward-looking commentaries about things like whose century this young one will be, as if it has to belong to either Us or Them. But what really seems in order during this countdown to the Olympics is slowing down and trying to catch our breath. Instead of peering anxiously ahead into the unknown, we would do well to pause, look back over our shoulders, and ask: Can we learn something useful from revisiting past moments when East-West exchanges increased? And those interested in the topic have some attractive places <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> just <b>now,</b> thanks <b>to</b> the recent appearance of four books and the mounting of two new exhibits...|$|R
