25|$|An {{important}} part of the channel's presentation since launch has been <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link {{to the beginning of the}} next hour. A similar musical device is used on BBC Radio 5 Live, and mirrors the pips on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
25|$|The channel relocated, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} BBC News services at Television Centre, to the newly refurbished Broadcasting House on 18 March 2013 at 13:00 GMT. Presentation and on-screen graphics were refreshed, with new full HD studios and a live newsroom backdrop. Moving cameras in the newsroom form part of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> title sequence and are used {{at the start of}} weather bulletins.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 {{the channel}} was again relaunched {{with a new}} common BBC News style {{featuring}} a deep red and black globe and background with bright white lettering. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> sequence incorporated the first news headline into ribbons that formed part of the BBC News ident style. The first look featured a '24' numeral made out of lines bending in on screen, and {{was more of a}} cream colour than the white used by other bulletins: this was rectified in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Jazz FM in its {{previous}} form closed on Friday the 27 May 2005 {{with the last}} track played being, rather fittingly, Ella Fitzgerald's 'Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye'. GMG then played a promotion for Smooth FM alongside music tracks to be played on the new station and live news at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> until the launch of Smooth FM at 10am on 7 June {{with the help of}} R singer Lemar and then breakfast show presenter Jon Scragg.|$|E
25|$|Each hour {{consists}} of headlines on each quarter-hour, extended at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> {{to form the}} main part of the daily schedule though these are interspaced with other programmes, generally at weekends. This will be often be displaced by rolling news coverage including reports and live interviews. This channel also provides half-hourly weather summaries by forecasters from the BBC Weather centre and the sports news from the BBC Sport centre at MediaCityUK. At 21:25 a global weather forecast is broadcast and 21:55 Weather for the Week Ahead is broadcast.|$|E
25|$|The cast had {{continued}} to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ATWT then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break {{would be the last}} anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy {{had been shot in the}} head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 EST, with <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the press}} the horse {{received}} {{was viewed as}} giving a needed boost to the sport. Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont, [...] "I haven't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time, and it was right at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour...</b> He's brought us mainstream again {{for the first time}} in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way we do about him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans reminded us that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse." [...] When the horse won the 2016 Vox Populi award, Perry Martin said, [...] "I'm proud to witness the love and devotion of Chrome's fans. They've always seen what I've seen in him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{schedules}} include hourly news readings {{that run}} from 6â€“12 minutes on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> except for major programming like the 6 p.m. news show and Cross Country Checkup.

2500|$|The {{programming}} styles vary {{among these}} cable news channels, but often feature morning shows, along with blocks of rolling news coverage hosted by various personalities throughout the day. During {{the evening and}} primetime hours on weekdays, most cable news networks devote their lineups to opinion-based news and interview programs hosted by pundits. Most U.S. cable news networks do not provide live programming during the overnight hours aside from short updates at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour,</b> electing to air repeats of their evening programming instead. Some networks may source late-night programming from a sister international news service, such as CNN International for CNN.|$|E

2500|$|... 60 Minutes is also {{simulcast}} {{on several}} CBS Radio stations (such as KYW in Philadelphia, WCBS in New York City, KNX in Los Angeles, WBBM in Chicago, WWJ in Detroit and KCBS in San Francisco) when it airs locally on their sister CBS Television Network affiliate; {{even in the}} Central and Eastern time zones, the show is aired at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> at 7 p.m./6 p.m Central (barring local sports play-by-play pre-emptions and breaking news coverage) {{no matter how long}} the show is delayed on CBS Television, resulting in radio listeners often hearing the show on those stations ahead of the television broadcast. An audio version of each broadcast without advertising began to be distributed via podcast and the iTunes Store, starting with the September 23, 2007 broadcast. Video from 60 Minutes (including full episodes) is also made available for streaming several hours after the program's initial broadcast on CBSNews.com and CBS Interactive property CNET TV.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, {{hoping to}} build a new audience, Luxembourg in English once more {{returned}} with a daytime schedule {{for the first time since}} the early 1950s, but this time it was aimed at Scandinavian audiences using a 24-hour stereo transponder on the Astra 1A satellite to supplement the 208 analogue night-time service. The end eventually came for 208 at 3 am GMT on 30 December 1991 (the station did return to the analogue 208/1440 for one night a year later when the station finally closed its digital service), with the last record played on AM being Van Morrison's [...] "In the Days Before Rock and Roll" [...] (chosen mainly because of its mention of the radio station), before [...] "At the End of the Day" [...] (one of their closedown songs) was played heading into <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> (even though DJ Jeff Graham had said that they were going to play the original closedown tune, it was in fact the original song, but a later version the station used as the original was not located, [...] "It's Time To Say Goodnight"). The station then went satellite and shortwave (15350kHz) only, with the first songs played being [...] "When Will You (Make My Telephone Ring)" [...] by Deacon Blue and [...] "Always" [...] by Atlantic Starr.|$|E
2500|$|However, some BBC World News {{programmes}} {{are available}} to UK audiences. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of BBC World News on BBC One and the BBC News channel, followed by an edition of World Business Report. This programme was previously branded as 'The World Today'. [...] While international audiences see advertisements during the break, UK viewers see domestic headlines. [...] This simulcast is in addition to overnight simulcasts at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> from 00.00 to 05.00 UK time on both BBC World News and BBC News Channel and are simply branded as BBC News (except for Newsday which simulcasts at 00.00 UK time weekdays), {{even if they are}} produced by BBC World News. The 11:30 UK edition of BBC World News was shown on BBC Two Mon-Fri (but not on Wednesdays when Parliament is sitting and there is Prime Minister's Questions), but was discontinued as of December 2015, having been quietly replaced by the next half-hour of national BBC News (now known as Newsroom Live). This had formed BBC News at 11 on BBC Two, which was made up of half an hour of BBC News and then half an hour of BBC World News. Nowadays, this also happens on rare occasions during big news events and the News Channel presenter will join the BBC World News presenter in Studio C as it used by both channels. This was done for example for coverage of events such as the Glasgow Helicopter Crash, Election of Pope Francis and Boston Marathon Bombings. Previously GMT was shown at 12:30 on the channel.|$|E
