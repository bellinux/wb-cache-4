2500|$|Ulliott took £10,000 {{with him}} on the trip, and was around even, until he entered the $500 pot limit Omaha event of the 1997 Four Queens Poker Classic. When the event reached the heads-up stage, {{numerous}} Vietnamese-American followers of Men Nguyen supported the latter by cheering [...] "Go on the Master" [...] at him. In response, Whitaker cheered Ulliott on by cheering [...] "Go on the Devilfish." [...] The nickname was thought up by Stephen Au-Yeung early 1997, who ran a poker game that Ulliott had frequented in Birmingham UK, who later sold him the website DevilFishPoker.com in 2005; a devilfish (or fugu) is a poisonous fish that can kill when ingested, if not properly prepared. Ulliott reduced Nguyen's stack to one chip, and the tournament director insisted upon still taking a one-hour scheduled break, over Nguyen's protests. Ulliott turned to Nguyen and said, [...] "We’re taking the break, and in all fairness to you, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> upstairs and think about your tactics." [...] Ulliott went on to win, and the headlines the next day read, Devilfish devours the Master. Since the event, Ulliott claimed that the event was only of significance for defining his nickname.|$|E
2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March.

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer {{screening}} invitations can explicitly recommend attendance or encourage {{individuals to}} consider {{the risks and benefits}} before deciding for themselves. Public preferences for these approaches might vary. We explored ethnic minority women’s preferences for a strong recommendation to be screened. Methods Women aged 30 – 60 years from Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Caribbean, African and white British backgrounds (n[*]=[*] 120 per group) completed face-to-face interviews with a multi-lingual interviewer. The interview included a question on which approach to screening invitations they would prefer: i) A strong recommendation from the National Health Service (NHS) to go for screening, ii) A statement that the NHS <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> for screening, but it’s up to you to decide, iii) No recommendation. Analyses examined predictors of preference for a strong recommendation. Results Preferences varied by ethnicity (χ 2 (5) [*]=[*] 98. 20, p[*]<. 001). All ethnic minority groups had a preference for a strong recommendation to be screened (53 – 86 % across ethnic groups vs 31 % white British). Socio-demographic factors (marital status, education and employment), and indicators of acculturation (main language and migration status), contributed to explaining recommendation preferences (χ 2 (5) [*]=[*] 35. 95 and χ 2 (3) [*]=[*] 11. 59, respectively, both p[*]<. 001), but did not mediate the ethnicity effect entirely. Self-rated comprehension of written health information did not contribute to the model. Conclusions A strong recommendation to participate in cancer screening appears to be important for ethnic minority women, particularly non-English speakers. Future research could explore how to best arrive at a consensus that respects patient autonomy while also accommodating those that would prefer to be guided by a trusted source...|$|R

40|$|English periphrastic causative constructions, i. e. constructions such as 'He {{makes me}} laugh' or 'She had the car repaired', are often {{thought to be}} more or less {{equivalent}} and interchangeable (see e. g. Visser 1973 or Roggero 1979). When they are dealt with in grammars, the focus is usually on complementation, with no indications of other (semantic, stylistic, lexical, etc.) differences. Yet, according to the cognitive principle of No Synonymy (Goldberg 1995), the very existence of distinct causative constructions implies differences between them. In an attempt to characterise these usage differences, a study of the main periphrastic causative constructions (involving the verbs CAUSE, GET, HAVE, and MAKE) was carried out {{on the basis of a}} corpus of present-day written and spoken British English (10, 000, 000 -word subset of the British National Corpus), supplemented, when necessary, by experimental data collected through elicitation tests. The data were analysed according to over 40 syntactic, semantic, stylistic and lexical parameters, such as the tense of the causative verb, the animacy of the causer, or the lemma of the non-finite complement. Using various statistical techniques, it was possible to highlight a number of conditioning factors influencing the choice of one particular causative construction over another. Thus, it appears that the best predictor is the lemma of the non-finite verb. [X MAKE Y Vinf], for example, is most likely to occur with the infinitive 'feel', as illustrated in (1). Particularly common too in this construction are the verbs 'laugh', 'look' (mainly as a copular verb) and 'think' – all of which, incidentally, contradict the common claim that causative 'make' predominantly expresses coercion (see e. g. Faure & Casanova 1968 or Werner et al. 1990). (1) 	That’s right, if it makes you feel good inside I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> for it. These preferences differ from those displayed by the other constructions, with [X HAVE Y Vpp], for example, preferring verbs referring to the frame of service such as 'cut' ('have one’s hair cut'), and [X GET Y Vprp] preferring verbs of (literal or metaphorical) motion, e. g. 'going', 'running', 'moving'. It should be emphasised that, while such lexical preferences have been recognised in the literature for [X MAKE Y Vpp] (cf. Van Ek & Robat 1984), they are almost completely ignored for the other constructions, probably due to the intuition-based approach adopted in most studies of periphrastic causative constructions. Similarly, the analysis of the other parameters reveals important differences between the constructions under investigation. To give a few more examples, it appears that what distinguishes 'get'- from 'have'-constructions is not so much style (as claimed by e. g. Thomson & Martinet 1980), but collocation, with 'get' showing a clear preference for contexts involving some sort of difficulty or effort, cf. (2). It also transpires from the analysis that [X CAUSE Y Vto-inf] is typical of scientific genres and that [X MAKE Y Vinf] often occurs with an inanimate causer (contra Givón 1993). (2) 	Darren was a poor feeder and mother remembered spending hours with him trying to get him to take the bottle. 	These and other distinctive features will be discussed, and it will be argued that causative constructions should each be considered in their own right (as advocated by Construction Grammar), rather than as a set of synonymous and interchangeable expressions...|$|E
