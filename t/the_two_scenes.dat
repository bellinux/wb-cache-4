25|$|In {{terms of}} {{differences}} {{from the original}} scene, there was a shift to a more post-punk sound {{as a result of}} the influence of the European bands of the 1980s. Also, the apolitical influence of psychobilly discouraged political debates with the potential to fragment the scene (however some famous deathrock acts, such as Rudimentary Peni, were originally anarcho-punk bands, and there existed some slight crossover between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes).</b> The Drop Dead Festival, similar to psychobilly's Hootenanny, gave bands with smaller fan bases an opportunity to play before larger crowds.|$|E

25|$|The scene {{gradually}} became increasingly {{common in the}} art of the Western church, and increasingly rare in Orthodox art. Various themes in theological exegesis of the event influenced the treatment in art. As the first drawing of Christ's blood, it was also seen as a forerunner of, or even the first scene of, the Passion of Christ, {{and was one of the}} Seven Sorrows of Mary. Other interpretations developed based on it as the naming ceremony equivalent to Christian baptism, the aspect which was eventually to become most prominent in Catholic thinking. Both in this respect and in terms of finding a place in a pictorial cycle, consideration of the circumcision put it in a kind of competition with the much better established Presentation of Jesus; eventually <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> were to be conflated in some paintings.|$|E

The conversation between Fleance and Banquo in their own murder scene is especially dark. Banquo's first line from within [...] "Give us a light there, ho!" [...] communicates the nighttime setting. The stage direction [...] "Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE, with a torch", seems to foreshadow the fact that Fleance is a light for Scotland {{in the midst of}} the play's black deeds.|$|E

500|$|Filming began {{late in the}} day on February 28, as {{the shoot}} on [...] "One" [...] had overrun, the {{production}} team had hoped to have the shoot for [...] "Hope and Fear" [...] underway the day prior. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> which were filmed on February 28 both took place on the standing Voyager sets, with adjustments made to the lighting by cinematographer Marvin V. Rush. The shooting wrapped for the day at 1:45am, with four of the six planned scenes unfilmed and needing to be fit elsewhere into the schedule. The seventh day of filming on March 9 saw the movement of the shoot to the Dauntless engineering set. The design proposed by Kolbe did not make it into production due to the cost and complexity of it, but he was still pleased with the final result as it enabled some different shooting positions than the usual Voyager set.|$|E
500|$|While Glee also {{features}} Chenoweth's former Wicked co-star Idina Menzel as recurring character Shelby Corcoran, the producers {{declined to give}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> together, explaining that the series is story-driven, and as re-uniting the two on-screen did not work for storytelling purposes, it was deemed unnecessary. Of Chenoweth's future with Glee beyond [...] "Home", Falchuk commented that the producers want to [...] "have her around as much as possible", and although no plans have been solidified, she may return in the second season. He expanded: [...] " [...] you have talents like that, it's very hard to not want them back. The one advantage we have, I think, {{is that we have}} so many incredibly talented people in our … cast that … we don't need [...] as much. But there are certain very special people that, of course, you'd always be interested in." ...|$|E
500|$|The skyline of {{the center}} panel (220 × 195cm, 87 × 77in) matches exactly {{with that of the}} left wing, while the {{positioning}} of its central pool and the lake behind it echoes the lake [...] in the earlier scene. The center image depicts the expansive [...] "garden" [...] landscape which gives the triptych its name. The panel shares a common horizon with the left wing, suggesting a spatial connection between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes.</b> The garden is teeming with male and female nudes, together with a variety of animals, plants and fruit. The setting is not the paradise shown in the left panel, but neither is it based in the terrestrial realm. Fantastic creatures mingle with the real; otherwise ordinary fruits appear engorged to a gigantic size. The figures are engaged in diverse amorous sports and activities, both in couples and in groups. Gibson describes them as behaving [...] "overtly and without shame", while art historian Laurinda Dixon writes that the human figures exhibit [...] "a certain adolescent sexual curiosity".|$|E

500|$|Film critic Baradwaj Rangan {{finds the}} {{sequence}} where Haasan's character, Cheenu, narrates {{the story of}} The Blue Jackal to Sridevi's character, Bhagyalakshmi, to be a distant echo of the arc negotiated by Cheenu: [...] "He is, after all, a nobody [...] who, through a salubrious twist of fate, becomes the ruler of a woman's life, until he is restored, at the end, to the nobody he was, a fraudulent claimant to her emotions." [...] In his book Dispatches from the wall corner: A journey through Indian cinema, Rangan says that although Haasan is inspired by Marlon Brando, the scene where Haasan burns himself while cooking and vents his anger on Sridevi, {{is reminiscent of the}} acting style of Marcel Marceau. In another book of Rangan, Conversations with Mani Ratnam, he states that in the scene where Cheenu enters Bhagyalakshmi's room in the brothel, there was fumbling and embarrassment, whereas in another Haasan film Nayakan (1987), Haasan's character, Velu Nayakar, behaves as if he has visited a brothel before. Nayakans director Mani Ratnam replied by saying that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> are very different from one another and that it [...] "can't be played the same way".|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{features}} a family observing Shabbat. Spielberg said that [...] "to start the film with the candles being lit... {{would be a}} rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins." [...] When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to {{a world in which}} smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent [...] "just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope." [...] Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at York University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the crematoria. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end. She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to Aryan men, especially Göth and Schindler.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Las Meninas relate to earlier works by Velázquez {{in which he}} plays with {{conventions}} of representation. In the Rokeby Venus—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although [...] "often described as looking at herself, [...] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early Christ in the House of Martha and Mary of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are {{clear that this is}} the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of Los Borrachos of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early bodegones, the figures look directly at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Darren McGavin {{was set to}} reprise {{his role}} as Arthur Dales; the {{character}} had previously appeared in the episodes [...] "Travelers" [...] and [...] "Agua Mala". Two days after filming began, McGavin suffered a stroke, forcing Duchovny and the producers to remove from the episode the few scenes he had shot, rewrite the script to explain his absence, and replace his character with M. Emmet Walsh. Because many of the scenes featuring a younger Dales had already been shot, Duchovny was forced to give Walsh's character the same name as McGavin's character; this was justified in the episode as a quirk {{on behalf of the}} two brothers' parents. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> that were filmed with McGavin included the sequence in which Mulder asks Dales whether all great baseball players are aliens, and a scene in which Mulder asks Dales why he joined the FBI. McGavin, who eventually recovered, later allowed the scenes to be included on the sixth season DVD as bonus features. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later called it a [...] "great sorrow that" [...] the show had to replace Darren McGavin because the series' producers were [...] "huge fans" [...] of his role in the 1972 film The Night Stalker and [...]|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{praised the}} series' pop culture {{reference}}s. Carina Belles applauded the series for making subtle pop culture references, citing Pinkie Pie's mention of [...] "Chocolate Rain", {{a reference to}} a popular Internet meme. Many reviews and critics positively commented on the episode's ending, which featured a parody of the closing scenes to the original Star Wars. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 wrote positively of the scene, writing, [...] "Honestly, modern My Little Pony fandom {{is one of those things}} I'm live-and-let-live about, even though it baffles me entirely [...] this morning's episode of the show did a little homage to A New Hope." [...] i09 later named the scene one of [...] "The Best Television Moments of 2011". John Farrier from Neatorama wrote, [...] "It’s hard for Bronies to get respect from some quarters, but [...] scene alone says much in favor of the show." [...] The entertainment site Dorkly, an affiliate of CollegeHumor, featured a video comparing <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> and wrote, [...] "May the adorable be with you." [...] Topless Robot writer Anne Mathews named the Star Wars parody the [...] "Nerdiest Easter Egg" [...] in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, writing, [...] "This scene is a direct shoutout to the fans and completely cements the creator Lauren Faust's geek cred. The only thing missing is a Wookiee yell at the end!" ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout filming, various scenes {{make use}} of all three effects departments. For scenes {{involving}} the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in [...] "Home", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith {{stood in front of}} a black background with wind blowing onto her, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> were later combined in post-production. Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them. For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck to go out of control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look [...] "pretty real".|$|E

2500|$|Some scholars, notably P.D. Leveto, {{interpret}} the cycle as being [...] "Marian", that is, {{part of the}} Life of Mary, rather than specifically representing those scenes associated with the Nativity. Evidence for this interpretation {{is the presence of}} the rarely depicted scene of the [...] "Trial by Bitter Water". With this interpretation, the three missing narrative scenes would have had a different content, and the sequence itself would be differently ordered, moving from the left-hand side of the arch to the first two scenes of the lower register, through the top register and then to lower right-hand scenes and finishing with the Magi scene {{on the opposite side of}} the arch. In this proposed arrangement, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> of the Birth and Presentation at the Temple of Mary are visually balanced with each other, whilst the Presentation and the Trial by water above it are concerned with Mary's virginity. Also balanced are <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>scenes</b> of offerings on either side of the arch wall; in both cases the figures are placed to make their offerings away from the empty arched space, to keep the visual attention focused within the apse.|$|E
