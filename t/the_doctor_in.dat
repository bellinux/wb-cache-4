Nielsen portrayed <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish horror comedy Spanish Movie, a spoof comedy like Scary Movie, but making fun of popular Spanish films.|$|E
5|$|The anachronistic wetsuits on the Edwardian ship were {{actually}} heavy-duty overalls {{that had been}} painted black. Janet Fielding struggled with the low cut ball-gown she wore during filming as it threatened to expose her breasts {{on a number of}} occasions. The ball gown worn by Baron was made especially for the serial and was the most expensive costume on display. The newspaper found by <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> Part One was a reprint of The Times from September 1901, while the food and drink served during the party scenes was all real.|$|E

5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there {{said that she}} had looked into some of the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> <b>In</b> November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by Billie Piper in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and {{was created by}} series producer Russell T Davies. With the revival of Doctor Who in 2005, Rose was introduced as a new travelling companion of series protagonist, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> <b>in</b> his ninth and tenth incarnations. The companion character, intended {{to act as an}} audience surrogate, was key in the first series to introduce new viewers to the mythos of Doctor Who, which had not aired regularly since 1989. Piper received top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant for the duration of her time as a regular cast member. A regular for all of series one (2005) and series two (2006), Piper later returned for three episodes of the programme's fourth series (2008) and appeared in feature-length specials in both 2010 and 2013.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> flashes back {{to several}} of his former companions from the revived series, who each say [...] "Doctor", similar to what <b>the</b> Fourth <b>Doctor</b> {{experienced}} <b>in</b> Logopolis. When <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> awakens, he quotes himself from previous regenerations: [...] "Sontarans perverting the course of human history" [...] (<b>the</b> Fourth <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> Robot), [...] "I don't want to go!" [...] (<b>the</b> Tenth <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> End of Time), and [...] "When <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> was me..." [...] (<b>the</b> Eleventh <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> [...] "The Time of the Doctor").|$|R
5000|$|While {{walking the}} ice cold wastes {{of the prison}} planet in his regular clothes, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> seems quite {{unaffected}} by the cold. This was a trait shown by <b>the</b> Second <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Tomb of the Cybermen, <b>the</b> Fourth <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Seeds of Doom and The Hand of Fear, <b>the</b> Ninth <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] and <b>the</b> Tenth <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Planet of the Ood", and an improvement over how <b>the</b> First <b>Doctor</b> responded to cold - not just subzero cold - in The Space Museum.|$|R

5|$|William Shatner plays Captain James T. Kirk; Shatner {{felt that}} though dramatic, the script made Kirk look too prejudiced. Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>in</b> The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors {{got to know each other}} better than they ever had.|$|E
5|$|Vikram {{was educated}} at Montfort School, Yercaud, a {{boarding}} school in a hill station near Salem and graduated in 1983. He has mentioned that he used his opportunities at school well by taking part in karate, horseback riding and swimming and noted that such early exposure to activities gave him confidence as a youngster. Vikram lurked in {{the fringes of the}} school's theatre club for a long period and often took part in backstage work before being handed the lead role in a school adaptation of Moli√®re's <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>in</b> Spite of Himself after the original lead had contracted chicken pox. Despite expressing his interest to join films after school, his father forced him to go through education with Vikram subsequently graduating in English literature from Loyola College, Chennai and working halfway through an MBA programme. Through the prolific dramatics club, Vikram appeared in stage productions including college adaptations of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial and Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, receiving best actor awards for his performances. After winning a Best Actor Award at a function held at IIT Madras, Vikram was hit by a truck during a while on his motorbike on the way home and suffered a serious leg injury. He remained hospital-ridden for three years during college and subsequently went through twenty three surgeries to prevent his leg from being amputated. Vikram then returned to finish the final year of his degree after his accident and secured permission to finish his dissertation at home, as he was only able to walk on crutches for a short period.|$|E

It is a crude satire on the duel and on the traditional concepts of honor and nobility of the Prussian officer corps, which in the developing bourgeois society were increasingly anachronistic. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>in</b> his honor was Hausdorff's greatest literary success. In 1914‚Äì1918 there were numerous performances in more than thirty cities. Hausdorff later wrote an epilogue to the play, {{but it was not}} performed at that time.
