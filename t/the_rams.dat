5|$|The Bears visited Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis to play <b>the</b> <b>Rams,</b> {{again without}} Jay Cutler. However, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> were also without {{starting}} quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive games against <b>the</b> <b>Rams.</b> Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded {{an average of}} 107.7 {{yards and three touchdowns}} in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; and receiver Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 drives in the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. <b>The</b> <b>Rams</b> also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall.|$|E

5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} the Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to a}} legal battle with <b>the</b> <b>Rams,</b> who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns. Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns, claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract to play for <b>the</b> <b>Rams.</b> Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for <b>the</b> <b>Rams</b> because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} Rotated Arc Mixer (RAM) for {{continuous}} mixing and heat exchange of highly viscous foods. Principal advantages of <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> are <b>the</b> simplicity of construction/disassembly and the attendant large energy savings {{due to the}} absence of internal elements. The absence of internal obstructions benefits the performance of <b>the</b> <b>RAM</b> in several ways.

40|$|AbstractMitochondria {{contain a}} {{sophisticated}} system for transporting Ca 2 +. The {{existence of a}} uniporter and of both Na+-dependent and -independent efflux mechanisms {{has been known for}} years. Recently, a new mechanism, called <b>the</b> <b>RaM,</b> which seems adapted for sequestering Ca 2 + from physiological transients or pulses has been discovered. <b>The</b> <b>RaM</b> shows a conductivity {{at the beginning of a}} Ca 2 + pulse that is much higher than the conductivity of the uniporter. This conductivity decreases very rapidly following the increase in [Ca 2 +] outside the mitochondria. This decrease in the Ca 2 + conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> is associated with binding of Ca 2 + to an external regulatory site. When liver mitochondria are exposed to a sequence of pulses, uptake of labeled Ca 2 + via <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> appears additive between pulses. Ruthenium red inhibits <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> in liver mitochondria but much larger amounts are required than for inhibition of the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter. Spermine, ATP and GTP increase Ca 2 + uptake via <b>the</b> <b>RaM.</b> Maximum uptake via <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> from a single Ca 2 + pulse in the physiological range has been observed to be approximately 7 nmole/mg protein, suggesting that Ca 2 + uptake via <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> and uniporter from physiological pulses may be sufficient to activate the Ca 2 +-sensitive metabolic reactions in the mitochondrial matrix which increase the rate of ATP production. RaM-mediated Ca 2 + uptake has also been observed in heart mitochondria. Evidence for Ca 2 + uptake into the mitochondria in a variety of tissues described in the literature is reviewed for evidence of participation of <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> in this uptake. Possible ways in which the differences in transport via <b>the</b> <b>RaM</b> and <b>the</b> uniporter may be used to differentiate between metabolic and apoptotic signaling are discussed...|$|R
