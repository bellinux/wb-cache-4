5|$|As Lucan's {{bankruptcy}} proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors {{were informed}} that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The family silver was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust {{in the years immediately}} following his disappearance. His family was granted probate over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, George Bingham, Lord Bingham, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the House of Lords. Following the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> Death Act 2013, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a High Court hearing at the Rolls Building on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Scotland was a {{theoretically}} patriarchal society, {{in which}} men had total authority over women, but how this worked is practice is difficult to discern. Marriages, particularly higher in society, were often political in nature {{and the subject of}} complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating and finding marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient. At the beginning of the period, women had a very limited legal status. The criminal courts refused to recognise them as witnesses or independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. In the post-Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women, partly evident in witchcraft prosecutions from 1563. Through the 1640s, independent commissions were set up to try women for child murder, and after pressure from the kirk a law of 1690 placed <b>the</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> guilt on a woman if she concealed a pregnancy and birth, and her child later died.|$|E

How is {{the relationship}} between formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists and <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in criminal judicial system. Research Objectives 1. to identify and analyze the policy on formulation of protection of rights of accused terrorists in the line with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in criminal judicial system. 2. To identify and analyze the policy on formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists in the line with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in criminal judicial system. It was a juridicial normative research with qualitative analysis. Research Finding : The formulation of protection of rights of accused terrorists is normatifvely provided in the Criminal Codes and Law of Terrorism Combat. The policy on formulation of protection of the rights of accused terrorists in those two laws is not yet fully harmonious since in the Law of Terrorism Combat there is a provision inconsistent with the principles of proof provided in the Criminal Codes. However, the rest is in general in coherence with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. <b>The</b> policy on formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists is already consistent with the principle of protection to the rights of accused terrorists in compliance the Criminal Codes and Law of Terrorism Combat. The policy on formulation of procedures of treating accused terrorists is normatively consistent with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. However, in their implementations, there were still technical obstacles due to some diffrent perceptions in understanding the provisions concerning with treatment to accused terrorists by the legal enforcers...|$|R

However, these rights were not respected in practice. While some judges allowed public access to trials, other judges, notably those presiding in rape trials, did not. There are no juries. Defendants have the right to appeal most cases except those involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling, which the Court of State Security generally adjudicates. In some instances special military tribunals, whose jurisdiction is ill defined, adjudicate national security cases. The law provides for court-appointed counsel at state expense in certain cases, but the government often did not provide such counsel.|$|E
