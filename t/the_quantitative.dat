5|$|Sustainability {{measurement}} is a {{term that}} denotes the measurements used as <b>the</b> <b>quantitative</b> basis for the informed management of sustainability. The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, sustainability standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied {{over a wide range}} of spatial and temporal scales.|$|E

Of particular importance {{was the work of}} Alexander von Humboldt, which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of natural history) using <b>the</b> <b>quantitative</b> approaches of natural philosophy (i.e., physics and chemistry). Humboldt's work laid the foundations of biogeography and inspired several generations of scientists.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies <b>the</b> <b>quantitative</b> criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E

X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used.
