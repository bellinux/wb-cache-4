5|$|The oldest gymnasiums in {{the country}} are Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík and Menntaskólinn á Akureyri. Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík traces its origin to 1056, when a school was {{established}} in Skálholt. The school was moved to Reykjavík in 1786, but poor housing conditions forced it <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again</b> in 1805 to Bessastaðir near Reykjavík. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavík.|$|E
5|$|After Elverson's {{death in}} 1911, his son {{by his wife}} Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the {{newspaper}} continued to grow, eventually needing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again.</b> Elverson Jr. bought land at Broad and Callowhill Streets and built the eighteen-story Elverson Building, {{now known as the}} Inquirer Building. The first Inquirer issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. Jules Patenôtre, took over.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again</b> at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E

5|$|Through this period, Rowe finally {{concluded}} that Dundee was unsuitable {{for any of}} the researchers, and decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again.</b> This time he selected Worth Matravers on the southern coast, where all of the radar teams could once again work together. Due to confused timing and better planning {{on the part of the}} AI team, they arrived at Worth Matravers from St Athan before the long convoy from Dundee could make its way south. This caused a traffic jam that further upset Rowe. Nevertheless, everything was set up by the end of May 1940, with the AI team working primarily from huts south of Worth Matravers, and carrying out installations at a nearby airfield. With this move the entire group became the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE), only to be renamed again as the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940.|$|E
5|$|After Charles's death, {{the former}} Austrian {{imperial}} family were soon <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again.</b> Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and {{they agreed to}} allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita {{gave birth to a}} posthumous child, Archduchess Elisabeth. Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, {{who did not want to}} be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much of this money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 15 April Océan {{finally began}} <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again,</b> {{reaching}} safety upriver by 03:30. Several other ships were exposed, {{but without a}} bomb vessel they lay beyond {{the range of the}} British fleet. The French sailors made significant efforts to retrieve these ships over the following days; on 16 April Indienne was deemed too damaged to be saved, abandoned, and set on fire. The frigate exploded at midday. The following day Foudroyant and Tourville reached safety, and only Régulus now remained vulnerable. For several days in severe gales and heavy rain the ship remained stranded in the mud while Wolfe worked to bring up newly arrived replacement bomb vessel HMS Thunder. An attack on 20 April failed after the gun spilt almost immediately, and a larger scale attack with both bomb vessels and smaller ships failed on 24 April. No further attempts were made to destroy Régulus, and on 29 April the ship was finally refloated and brought to safety in the Charente. On the same day Gambier finally abandoned his blockade of the river and sailed his fleet for England.|$|E

5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On this train journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again,</b> but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again,</b> two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed with}} which the club became {{established}} following its foundation {{is illustrated by the}} fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Cooper's Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881, they appear to have alternated between Cooper's Hill and Dartmouth Park. During the 1881–82 season, they played at Bunn's Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000, and was Albion's first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again.</b> From 1885 to 1900, Albion played at Stoney Lane; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club's history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times.|$|E

5|$|During April 1944, No. 78 Wing {{received}} orders <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again,</b> {{this time}} to support Operation Reckless, the American landing at Hollandia in western New Guinea. The main party of the squadron departed Cape Gloucester on 17 April bound for Tadji airstrip on the mainland of New Guinea, and its Kittyhawks arrived there on the 24th of the month. No. 78 Squadron began flying patrols over the American beachhead at Hollandia the next day. The squadron continued to provide air defence for Hollandia and Tadji throughout early May. From 7 to 10 May a detachment of 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron operated from the Hollandia beachhead; owing to food shortages in the area the pilots arrived with rations for four days loaded in their aircraft. On 15 May the unit moved permanently to an airfield near Hollandia, from which it escorted USAAF bombers and formed part of the force protecting the US Army landings at Wakde on 17 May and Biak on the 27th. Overall, the squadron flew 601 sorties during May. Its operations over Biak included its only air-to-air combat of the war. On 3 June, 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron intercepted a group of 12 Nakajima Ki-43 fighters and two Nakajima B5N bombers near Biak. The Australian airmen downed five Ki-43s and two B5Ns {{for the loss of}} one Kittyhawk and its pilot. This was the last major air battle fought by the RAAF during the Pacific War. On 10 June, eight No. 78 Squadron Kittyhawks were escorting a convoy when they sighted a Japanese Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter. Two of the Australian aircraft attacked the Ki-61 and shot it down near Japen Island. This was the final aerial victory achieved by the RAAF during the New Guinea campaign. No. 78 Squadron continued to fly defensive patrols over Hollandia until 20 July, when it was redeployed to Noemfoor island. This was the squadron's sixth move in nine months, and the intensive effort needed to pack and unpack stores on each occasion caused widespread fatigue among airmen and ground crew.|$|E

25|$|About 60% {{crystallization}} is {{the upper}} limit for commercial products, {{with the exception of}} polyester fibers. Clear products can be produced by rapidly cooling molten polymer below Tg glass transition temperature to form an amorphous solid. Like glass, amorphous PET forms when its molecules are not given enough time to arrange themselves in an orderly, crystalline fashion as the melt is cooled. At room temperature the molecules are frozen in place, but, if enough heat energy is put back into them by heating above Tg, they begin <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again,</b> allowing crystals to nucleate and grow.

It traveled southeast on the north bank of the Pamunkey River, hoping to find the appropriate place to break through Lee's lines. On May 27, Union cavalry established a bridgehead {{on the south side of}} the river, near the Hanovertown Ford. As Grant's infantry crossed, cavalry divisions from both armies fought to a standstill at the Battle of Haw's Shop on May 28.|$|E
25|$|By {{sometime}} in the late 1780s or 1790s, the Tunica had decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>again,</b> probably {{because of the large}} influx of Anglo-Americans. They moved west to a site on the Red River named Avoyeles, where they were subsequently granted land by the Spanish. Other tribes also settled in the area, such as the Ofo, Biloxi, and Avoyel. In 1794 a Sephardic Jewish immigrant from Venice, Italy, named Marco Litche (the French recorded him as Marc Eliche), established a trading post in the area. The settlement he founded became known as Marksville. It was noted on Louisiana maps as of 1809, after the United States acquired the territory by the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
