25|$|From 1926 to 1941, {{scores on}} the SAT were scaled to make 500 <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> on each section. In 1941 and 1942, SAT scores were {{standardized}} via test equating, and as a consequence, average verbal and math scores could vary from that time forward. In 1952, mean verbal and math scores were 476 and 494, respectively, and scores were generally stable in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, starting in the mid-1960s and continuing until the early 1980s, SAT scores declined: the average verbal score dropped by about 50 points, and the average math score fell by about 30 points. By the late 1970s, only the upper third of test takers were {{doing as well as}} the upper half of those taking the SAT in 1963. From 1961 to 1977, the number of SATs taken per year doubled, suggesting that the decline could be explained by demographic changes in the group of students taking the SAT. Commissioned by the College Board, an independent study of the decline found that most (up to about 75%) of the test decline in the 1960s could be explained by compositional changes in the group of students taking the test; however, only about 25 percent of the 1970s decrease in test scores could similarly be explained. Later analyses suggested that up to 40 percent of the 1970s decline in scores could be explained by demographic changes, leaving unknown {{at least some of the}} reasons for the decline.|$|E

[...] Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city.

40|$|Part 1, which {{appeared}} in the February 2012 issue, introduced the concept of confidence intervals (CIs) for mean values. This article explains how to compare the CIs of two <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> to draw a conclusion about {{whether or not they are}} statistically different. Two <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> are said to be statistically different if their respective CIs do not overlap. Overlap of the CIs suggests that the scores may represent the same “true” population value; in other words, the true difference in <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> may be equivalent to zero. Some researchers choose to provide the CI for the difference of two <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> instead of providing a separate CI for each of <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores.</b> In that case, the difference in <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> is said to be statistically significant if its CI does not include zero (e. g., if the lower limit is 10 and the upper limit is 30).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{administer}} to Indian and Metis student in northern Saskatchewan, the Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test,which,purports to measure perceptual disorders, and to relate the HOD scores to criteria such as age, sex, academic achievement and the menstrual cycle. The sample consisted of three hundred and four male and female subjects between the ages of twelve and eighteen. Seven hypotheses were proposed. The Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test consists of one hundred and forty-five true and false questions which are designed to measure visual, auditory, olfactory, touch, taste and time perception. High HOD scores indicate abnormality. The greater the degree of distortion evident in these areas, the greater the probability the individual suffers from subclinical pellagra, a term recently introduced to refer to these per­ceptual abnormalities. Previous data indicate that perceptual disorders interfere with learning. The results of this investigation and those of previous studies provide evidence as to the feasibility of using the HOD as a diagnostic tool for detecting perceptual changes which are associated with learning and behavioral problems. The findings clearly indicate that subjects with high HOD scores were also experiencing academic difficulties. 1. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of female subjects were significantly higher than <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of male subjects. 2. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> decreased significantly as age increased. 3. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of those students who passed their grade were significantly lower than <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of those who failed or quit their grade. 4. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> decreased significantly as average marks increased. 5. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> increased significantly as age-grade differences increased. 6. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of those students referred to the educational psychologist were higher than <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of those students not referred, although this difference was not statistically significant. 7. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of female subjects taking the test during paramenstrum were significantly higher than <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> of female subjects taking the test not during paramenstrum...|$|R
