He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the series}} were active in debating if the Smoking Man was {{actually}} dead after {{the events of the}} season five premiere [...] "Redux". In his first response, Chris Carter said he had left clues in the episode, and he later officially announced that the character would appear in The X-Files movie. In one of his last comments on the matter, he said, [...] "Not that we haven't brought deceased characters back before, in flashbacks or more paranormal ways. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> The X-Files is that anything can happen." ...|$|E

[...] The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming {{to the conclusion that}} people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: [...] "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a bastard – but that's <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> him, you see?" ...|$|E

Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and what you have become. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E
500|$|In 2015, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Tyrion's {{meeting with}} Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) an [...] "iconic meetup" [...] that [...] "delighted fans, who were universally {{enthusiastic}} (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R. Martin’s novels." [...] Dinklage {{said in the}} interview, [...] "That’s <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> my character: He’s been everywhere. He’s the only character that goes searching. He’s been to The Wall {{and now he has}} to find the dragons." [...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him [...] "back into power".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, I predict this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been. She's recovering." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurt reveals {{himself to}} be gay early in the show's first season. The scene in which he tells his father was taken {{verbatim}} from Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who [...] "wins and triumphs". He further explained, [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> me.

500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of}} her life means that we know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Quinn is {{described}} by Agron as Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) enemy, and [...] "terrible, the meanest girl". Agron said that her favorite part of Quinn is that [...] "she's smart. But she's also human, and through her tough exterior, she's often a little girl lost." [...] Interviewmagazine.com's Lauren Waterman has described her as being [...] "lovable, but occasionally a manipulative deposed queen bee." [...] Agron commented: [...] "Yes, there is a stereotype with these characters and it wouldn't be fair if [...] didn't exist a little bit. But [...] Ryan Murphy {{has a way of}} taking everything and turning it upside down. That's <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this show and these characters: nobody is one note, which is amazing." [...] Quinn was originally conceived as the antagonistic queen bee head cheerleader, a departure from Agron's actual high school experience. Agron {{said in an interview with}} HitFix: [...] "I definitely wasn't cool in high school. I really wasn't. I did belong to many of the clubs and was in leadership on yearbook and did the musical theater route, so I had friends in all areas, but I certainly did not know what to wear, did not know how to do my hair, all those things." [...] She added: [...] "I think that it shows that regardless of who you are and what group you belong to, that there are so many emotions behind each person in high school. Sometimes with teens, writers or directors, anybody, short-changes them and makes them be simple, simple individuals, you're either the jock or the popular kid or the nerd. They don't show those shades. Everybody has those shades to them. This show, it really expands upon vulnerability and excitement and anger all the experiences that you probably actually go through in high school." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt and to the point. 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album {{and working with}} Barlow again, Williams said: [...] "It’s {{incredible}} {{to listen to the}} album and realise that it’s already been 20 years of making music and playing gigs. And <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the album is that it’s not only a celebration of my past but also a bridge to the future.

2500|$|Artist Maurizio Cattelan {{describes}} that it {{is difficult}} to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: [...] "That's probably <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Warhol: <b>the</b> way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless." [...] Warhol was an inspiration towards Cattelan's magazine and photography compilations, such as Permanent Food, Charley, and Toilet Paper.|$|R
5000|$|In Voyages of Imagination, {{the plot}} for the novel was {{originally}} developed shortly after Star Trek: Deep Space Nine ended. Pocket Books editor Marco Palmieri recalled, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> David's {{involvement in the}} project was that Abyss was the story that followed up on Avatar. It was extraordinarily cool {{to have one of}} DS9's TV writers developing a story for the post-TV fiction, with its mix of old and new characters." ...|$|R
5000|$|Theatre Is Easy called Versailles 2015 [...] "delightful and provocative:" [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> any {{immersive}} theatre {{experience is}} that it immediately throws you {{into a situation where}} your senses are heightened and every experience is suddenly called into question—is that part of the show? Is that an actor? Is that supposed to be happening? This Is Not a Theatre Company’s (TINATC) new production, Versailles 2015, does exactly this in a delightful and provocative manner." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a media {{interview}} Spurs {{head coach}} Gregg Popovich commented, [...] "(Hill) does {{a little bit}} of everything, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> him is that he's a very good all around basketball player, he's a tenacious defender, he can score, he can run, he's a good passer, he knows how to play and he's really a team guy". When asked on multiple occasions which current NBA player he most resembled, Hill responded by picking Monta Ellis, adding that he sees himself as a combo guard and an energy player who enjoys playing defense and getting into the passing lanes. Hill was drafted by the Spurs to back up All-Star Tony Parker at point guard.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Kylie is {{that she}} differs from other celebrities. There is a {{separation}} between how celebrities perceive themselves and what the public wants to see. Most are concerned with reproducing a certain logo or caricature of themselves. They want to cling on to an image developed years ago which makes things difficult {{because there is no}} room to take a picture, you aren't really forced to improvise which is when the best things happen. Every photographer has their own very personal vision of her, and she lets them have it. That is the big difference with Kylie, that she walks in and says 'This is me, {{what are you going to}} do with it.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Graeme Smith {{played in}} the inaugural Indian Premier League for Rajasthan Royals. His opening {{partnership}} with Swapnil Asnodkar achieved significant success. [...] "You can know an opponent as a cricketer," [...] Royals captain Shane Warne, with whom Smith had had multiple dustups in the past, wrote afterwards, [...] "but you only start to know him as a bloke when you play in the same side. [...] As it turned out, the Graeme Smith I played alongside for the Rajasthan Royals in 2008 was different to the Graeme Smith I faced in the Test arena. [...] That was <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the Indian Premier League. [...] It brought together players from all countries to share ideas, swap experiences and take the game forward worldwide. [...] We had a laugh and a joke about the things we had said in the past.

[...] However he did go on to criticize the albums's ballad's. Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani felt that if [...] "the Pussycat Dolls really want to make their mark in the giant litter box that is popular music today, they need more of the big band burlesque of 'Right Now' and less of Diane Warren." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "one-star honorable mention", commenting that the group is [...] "sexier than your average prefab sexpots, but no fabber."
