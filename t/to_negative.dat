40|$|The {{accurate}} {{identification of}} promoter regions and transcription start sites {{is a challenge}} to the construction of human transcription regulation networks. Thus, an efficient prediction method based on theoretical formulation is necessary for this purpose. We used the method of increment diversity with quadratic discriminant analysis (IDQD) to predict transcription start sites (TSS). The method produced sensitivity and positive predictive value of more than 65 % with positives <b>to</b> <b>negatives</b> ratio of 1 : 58. The performance evaluation using Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) showed an auROC (area under ROC) of greater than 96 %. The evaluation by Precision Recall Curves (PRC) showed an auPRC (area under PRC) of about 26 % for positives <b>to</b> <b>negatives</b> ratio of 1 : 679 and about 64 % for positives <b>to</b> <b>negatives</b> ratio of 1 : 113. The results documented in this approach are either better or comparable to other known methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a {{two-sided market}} for news where advertisers may pay a media outlet <b>to</b> conceal <b>negative</b> {{information about the}} quality of their own product (paying positive <b>to</b> avoid <b>negative)</b> and/or <b>to</b> disclose <b>negative</b> information {{about the quality of}} their competitors' products (paying positive <b>to</b> go <b>negative).</b> We show that whether advertisers have negative consequences on the accuracy of news reports or not ultimately depends on the extent of correlation among advertisers' products. Specifically, the lower the correlation among the qualities of the advertisers' products, the (weakly) higher the accuracy of the media outlet' reports. Moreover, when advertisers' products are correlated, a higher degree of competition in the market of the advertisers' products may decrease the accuracy of the media outlet's reports. ...|$|R
