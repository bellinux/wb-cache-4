5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E
5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the divine and human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E

CYR61 is a powerful angiogenic inducer in vivo, and it can also promote cancer cell proliferation, invasion, survival, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and metastasis. Accordingly, forced overexpression of CYR61 enhanced tumor growth in xenografts of breast cancer cells, prostate cancer cells, ovarian carcinoma cells, and squamous carcinoma cells. Clinically, CYR61 expression correlates with the tumor stage, tumor size, lymph node positivity, and poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, glioma, gastric adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E

25|$|Unspecialised flies {{with short}} proboscides are found visiting {{primitive}} flowers with readily accessible nectar. More specialised flies like syrphids and tabanids can visit more advanced blooms, but their purpose is <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> themselves, and any transfer of pollen from one flower to another happens haphazardly. The {{small size of}} many flies is often made up for by their abundance, however they are unreliable pollinators as they may bear incompatible pollen, and lack of suitable breeding habitats may limit their activities.

25|$|According to the Talmud, manna {{was found}} near {{the homes of}} those with strong belief in God, and far from the homes of those with doubts; indeed, one {{classical}} midrash says that manna was intangible to Gentiles, as it would inevitably slip from their hands. The Midrash Tanhuma holds that manna melted, formed liquid streams, was drunk by animals, flavored the animal flesh, and was thus indirectly eaten by Gentiles, this being {{the only way that}} Gentiles could taste manna. Despite these hints of uneven distribution, classical rabbinical literature expresses the view that manna fell in very large quantities each day. It holds that manna was layered out over 2,000 cubits square, between 50 and 60 cubits in height, enough <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> the Israelites for 2,000 years and to be seen from the palaces of every king in the East and West.

Nest usurpation and stealing brood from those nests to feed young select for ground nest founding in these paper wasps.

25|$|Glycogen {{functions}} {{as one of}} two forms of long-term energy reserves, with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue (i.e., body fat). In humans, glycogen is made and stored primarily in {{the cells of the}} liver and skeletal muscle. In the liver, glycogen can make up from 5–6% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 100–120grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, Glycogen is found in a low concentration (1–2% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70kg can store roughly 400grams of glycogen. The amount of glycogen stored in the body—particularly within the muscles and liver—mostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate, and eating habits. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys, red blood cells, white blood cells, and glial cells in the brain. The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> the embryo.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{are major}} point sources of {{sediment}} {{contribution to the}} coastal sedimentary budget, this being particularly true of coasts with a steep gradient, where rivers directly dump their sediments at the coast. Coasts with a low gradient may lose river sediment to estuaries. Sediment delivery to the shoreline can be very intermittent mostly occurring during floods {{with the increase in}} flow typically creating an increase in sediment supplied to the coast. Some rivers are referred to as ‘large’ because they produce high amounts of sediment for which <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> the coastal environment. For example, the Waimakariri River on the coast of Canterbury, New Zealand produces 77% of sediment supplied to the Pegasus Bay coastline. This is not always the case with some rivers referred to as ‘small’ because they struggle to supply enough sediment to keep their coastlines from eroding, for example, the Rakaia River South of Banks Peninsula in Canterbury, New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E

500|$|Although all mammals produce milk <b>to</b> <b>nourish</b> their young, the cow is {{predominantly}} {{used throughout the}} world to produce milk and milk products for human consumption. Other animals used {{to a lesser extent}} for this purpose include sheep, goats, camels, buffaloes, yaks, reindeer, horses and donkeys. All these animals have been domesticated over the centuries, being bred for such desirable characteristics as fecundity, productivity, docility and the ability to thrive under the [...] prevailing conditions. Whereas in the past, cattle had multiple functions, modern dairy cow breeding has resulted in specialised Holstein Friesian-type animals that produce large quantities of milk economically.
