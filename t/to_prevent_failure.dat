2500|$|As Allen Dulles later stated, CIA {{planners}} {{believed that}} once the troops were on the ground, Kennedy would authorize any action required <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failure</b> – as Eisenhower had done in Guatemala in 1954 after that invasion {{looked as if it}} would collapse. President Kennedy was deeply dispirited and angered with the failure. [...] Several years after his death, the New York Times reported that he told an unspecified high administration official of wanting [...] "to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds." [...] However, following a [...] "rigorous inquiry into the agency's affairs, methods, and problems... did not 'splinter' it after all and did not recommend Congressional supervision." [...] Kennedy commented to his journalist friend Ben Bradlee, [...] "The first advice I'm going to give my successor is to watch the generals and to avoid feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters were worth a damn." ...|$|E

50|$|Driving caps serve no {{function}} {{in the operation of}} a pipe and may even be incapable of doing so. This is because the driving cap is cast from a material selected for its strength and not its corrosion resistance. Thus replacement of the driving cap with a different fitting becomes necessary <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failures</b> in materials handling pipe. Also, driving caps are not attractive in appearance, which is detrimental in residential and ornamental applications.|$|R
50|$|Control {{reconfiguration}} is {{an active}} approach in control theory to achieve fault-tolerant control for dynamic systems. It is used when severe faults, such as actuator or sensor outages, cause a break-up of the control loop, which must be restructured <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failure</b> at the system level. In addition to loop restructuring, the controller parameters must be adjusted to accommodate changed plant dynamics. Control reconfiguration is a building block toward increasing the dependability of systems under feedback control.|$|E
50|$|A beam under bending sees high {{stresses}} {{along the}} axial fibers that are farthest from the neutral axis. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failure,</b> {{most of the}} material in the beam must be located in these regions. Comparatively little material is needed in the area close to the neutral axis.

50|$|It is {{recommended}} that any knot {{which is used to}} attach a rope to a safety harness is always finished with a 'stopper' knot. A stopper knot, while serving to keep the loose end tidy, will not only help <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failure</b> of the primary knot, but also act as a secondary safety knot itself. It is sometimes said that if enough of a tail is left to tie a stopper knot, the stopper becomes unnecessary. The tail should be a minimum of 40 - 60 cm depending on the thickness of the rope.|$|E
50|$|Condition {{monitoring}} (or, colloquially, CM) is {{the process}} of monitoring a parameter of condition in machinery (vibration, temperature etc.), in order to identify a significant change which is indicative of a developing fault. It is a major component of predictive maintenance. The use of condition monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failure</b> and avoid its consequences. Condition monitoring has a unique benefit in that conditions that would shorten normal lifespan can be addressed before they develop into a major failure. Condition monitoring techniques are normally used on rotating equipment and other machinery (pumps, electric motors, internal combustion engines, presses), while periodic inspection using non-destructive testing techniques and fit for service (FFS) evaluation are used for stationary plant equipment such as steam boilers, piping and heat exchangers.|$|E
50|$|Tropical storm-force {{sustained}} winds, with gusts {{well over}} hurricane strength, knocked out power {{to hundreds of}} thousands, while heavy rainfall led to flooding. Many dams along the coastline were briefly over-topped, though they did not break completely and were later pumped <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>failure.</b> Gusts near hurricane intensity and heavy rainfall also led to widespread power outages in the neighboring state of Mississippi, while portions of Alabama recorded nearly 1 ft (0.3 m) of precipitation. As an extratropical cyclone, Isaac produced torrential rains across Arkansas, flooding numerous streets and homes, and damaging many crops across the region. Strong winds contributed to downed lines and trees. Overall, Isaac caused $2.39 billion (2012 USD) in damage and led to 41 fatalities. It currently is the costiest Atlantic hurricane to not be retired.|$|E
