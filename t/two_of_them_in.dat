5|$|In {{the wake}} of the fall of Gush Etzion, news of Degania's {{successful}} stand (as well as that of Kfar Darom) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages. The battle also influenced British opinion on {{the balance of power in}} the war. The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re-use <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets, among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.|$|E

5|$|Lugal: {{while in}} Mesopotamia a lugal {{designated}} a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was {{directly under the}} authority of the capital. The nature of this title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each lugal was {{under the authority of}} the grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities directly under the authority of the capital and they all brought goods to be kept in Ebla's storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, {{has concluded that}} the sand devil and the Pacific angel shark (S. californica) are sister species. The <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> turn form a clade with other angel sharks found in the Americas. Molecular clock estimation has timed the divergence of S. dumeril and S. californica at c. 6.1 Ma, around {{the time that the}} Isthmus of Panama formed. The rise of the Isthmus likely split the ancestral angel shark population, leading to their becoming separate species.|$|E
