5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E

5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> plane.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of sea-surface temperature (STT) and surface winds in selected {{areas of the}} Tropical Atlantic indicates that the nonseasonal variability of SST in <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Equatorial</b> Atlantic (Gulf of Guinea) is highly correlated with the nonseasonal variability of the zonal wind stress in <b>the</b> Western <b>Equatorial</b> Atlantic. A negative (positive) anomaly of the zonal wind stress near the North Brazilian coast {{is followed by a}} positive (negative) SST anomaly in the Gulf of Guinea about one month later. Furthermore, the correlation betweenthe local winds stress anomaly and STT anomaly in the Gulf of Guinea is considerably smaller. These preliminary results indicate that remote forcing in <b>the</b> Western <b>Equatorial</b> Atlantic ocean is an important factor affecting <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Equatorial</b> Atlantic sea-surface temperature. Recent equatorial theories are consistent with these observations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

5|$|During {{the months}} of May and June, four named systems developed. In July, one {{tropical}} storm and two hurricanes formed. The following month, five tropical systems developed.

A moderate El Nino was present throughout the season; water temperatures across <b>the</b> <b>equatorial</b> Central Pacific were 1.3°C (3°F) above normal. In addition, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period.|$|E

5|$|Terrestrial weather occurs almost {{exclusively}} in {{the lower part of}} the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.

These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.|$|E
