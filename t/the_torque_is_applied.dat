25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied,</b> it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

50|$|Torsion is the {{twisting}} of a muscular hydrostat along its long axis and {{is produced by}} a helical or oblique arrangement of musculature which have varying direction. For a counter-clockwise torsion {{it is necessary for}} a right-hand helix to contract. Contraction of a left-hand helix causes clockwise torsion. The simultaneous contraction of both right and left-hand helixes results in an increase in resistance to torsional forces. The oblique or helical muscle arrays in the muscular hydrostats are located in the periphery of the structure, wrapping the inner core of musculature, and this peripheral location provides a larger moment through which <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> than a more central location. The effect of helically arranged muscle fibers, which may also contribute to changes in length of a muscular hydrostat, depends on fiber angle—the angle that the helical muscle fibers make with the long axis of the structure.|$|E

A 2. 54 -cm cold-rolled steel bar was placed in a fixture and subjected to various applied <b>torques.</b> <b>The</b> measurements produced an initial transient signal followed by a changed static signal.

5000|$|This {{may seem}} odd. After all, if the axle were {{shifting}} in a horizontal groove, the friction {{on one end}} that acts {{to speed up the}} rotation would be canceled by the friction at the other end, operating in the opposite direction. The difference is that a torque is being applied, so one end of the axle is pushing against one side of the groove, while the other end is pushing against the other side. Likewise, it does not matter in which direction <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b> If the torque is reversed, each end of the axle will then be pressing against {{the opposite side of the}} groove, but the direction of precession is also reversed. The only restriction is that the relative speed of the surface of the axle and the side of the groove due to precession, , must exceed the relative speed due to the rotation of the spinning mass, [...] The minimum torque required to meet this condition is , where I is the moment of inertia of the spinning mass, and ω is its angular velocity.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the {{twisting}} or cam {{action of the}} socket on a bolt or nut head, nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>torque</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied</b> {{at or near the}} corners of the nut or bolt. Whether one uses either a twelve or six point socket the same stresses are applied in the same locations. Under load, nearly all of the flats of the nut are not touching the socket at all, it is only a small amount of the surfaces near the fastener corners which bears the torque loads. In nearly all applications over-stressing a bolt or nut will result in stripping the bolt or nut threads or breaking the bolt long before the socket will break. Tougher, thicker impact sockets are made for impact gun use. Occasionally when the corners of a bolt head or nut begin to become worn or damaged, the material the nut is made from can eventually smear or tear under load and create a situation where the corners are effectively [...] "rounded off". Some socket users believe that six point sockets are less likely to damage a fastener head, but tool evaluations and lab tests document that there is no difference in performance. A distorted or corroded fastener head may not fit a six-point socket but a twelve-point socket can be made to fit. When a fastener head is [...] "rounded off" [...] the nut or bolt can often no longer be turned without special repair or extraction tools. These rounded-off heads can incur substantial penalties, both direct and indirect. Deteriorated fasteners often inhibit the routine assembly and disassembly of the host components that rely on them, which can in turn deter users from performing normal maintenance procedures. Addressing the problem may require cost and effort, and potentially sidelining valuable equipment until the component's damaged fasteners have been replaced.|$|E

The orienting torque originates from the anisotropic scattering of polarized light by the trapped particle. The phenomenon is characterized in detail, the physics is analysed.

40|$|Sharp edges, {{boundaries}} between regions {{of high and}} low optical depth in planetary rings, are maintained by shepherd satellites which transfer angular momentum to and from the ring particles. We derive equations that govern the shapes of the perturbed streamlines near such a boundary.

The results of our calculation faithfully reproduce the sharp edges which bound the division and imply that the ring thickness in the unperturbed regions far from the edges is of order 10 m. In particular, the angle-averaged surface density is found to vary on a much shorter radial length scale than that over which <b>the</b> satellite <b>torque</b> <b>is</b> <b>applied.</b> We demonstrate that this striking feature is related to the local reversal of the viscous transport of angular momentum in the most strongly perturbed regions...|$|R
