40|$|The {{improved}} performance of computer-based text analysis represents {{a major step}} forward for knowledge management. Reliable text interpretation allows focus to be placed upon the content of documents, rather than just the document wrapping, and this helps to emphasise the fundamental difference between knowledge management and document management. It is not uncommon for companies who wish to join the KM band-wagon <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> existing document management programs with a KM label, even if such programs offer little more than a hierarchical file system and simple key-word search to support content management...|$|R

It also distributes various non-Playboy-branded movies and continues <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> and re-market its catalog of previously released DVD titles. Company-wide marketing operations consist of Alta Loma Entertainment, the Playboy Jazz Festival and Playmate Promotions. Alta Loma Entertainment {{functions as a}} production Company that leverages its assets, including editorial material, as well as icons such as the Playmates, the Playboy Mansion and Mr. Hefner, to develop original programming for other television networks.|$|R
5000|$|After German re-unification in 1990, {{the side}} was renamed FC Berlin {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> it and {{distance}} it from its past (Dynamo admitted to tier III of the new German league in 1991-92 season). In 1999 and due to the supporters' desire they again took up the name BFC Dynamo. Without its powerful patron and losing its best players to West German Bundesliga teams, the side quickly fell to tier III play and since the 2000-01 season has toiled in IV or V division leagues. The club filed for insolvency in 2001 but was rescued {{by a number of}} supporters. The insolvency proceedings were successfully closed in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid '90s, Seattle FilmWorks began <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> {{standard}} C-41 processed films {{while keeping}} the SFW-XL process designation—these films were able to be processed at all C-41 capable photo labs; however because of the SFW-XL designation many would not unless {{they were willing to}} inspect the film and verify that it did not have the ECN-2 rem-jet backing (which cannot be processed on C-41 equipment without damaging the entire batch of film in the machines). Seattle FilmWorks also offered [...] "prints and slides from the same roll", using cinema print film to create slides from the original negatives. These slides fade quickly when not properly stored, and are generally of inferior quality when compared to standard E6 or K-14 processed slides.|$|R
5000|$|Crumar of Italy and Music Technologies' of New York collaborated to form Digital Keyboards in {{an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> the Alles Machine. The result was a smaller two-part system, with a Z-80-based {{microcomputer}} and disk drives as one unit, and a single keyboard and limited set of input sliders as the second unit. Known as the Crumar General Development System, or GDS, it was released in 1980 for $30,000. It was sold to studios that needed a flexible system that could guarantee the same performance time after time. Analog synths of the same era were subject to environmental changes in the input controls that meant every performance, even after a short delay, would be different. Wendy Carlos owned a GDS and used it on the Tron soundtrack. She {{was also one of}} the instrument's most devoted users, and still uses it to this day.|$|R
40|$|A {{large volume}} of thought {{provoking}} material was collected at the conference, compelling NETN {{to do more than}} just document the conference. NETN has begun a multi-phased project <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> the material in such a way as to make it more readily available to a wider audience and to stimulate greater interest in the area of global nuclear materials management. This effort is undertaken so as to draw more students into this particular field of study. This paper describes the three phases of NETN’s efforts to introduce students to new careers in global nuclear materials management. Phase One occurred on July 22, 1999 when NETN documented the Conference on Global Nuclear Materials Management at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Phase Two continued the information dissemination with a video production that featured key policy makers. Based upon the knowledge obtained from the conference and the video production, Phase Three will build upon the information acquired to date and develop an hour-long presentation for an educational audience...|$|R
40|$|All too often, a small, {{private forest}} {{property}} fails {{to meet its}} potential for the owner or for the community. This is particularly true of depopulating rural areas in industrialized countries where community demographics are changing most. Some attention has recently been given to rural tourism as an option to assist Asian farmers in these circumstances, but what of its potential to assist small-scale forestry producers? This paper examines a population of small forest property owners in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The paper assesses the receptiveness of this community of forest owners {{to the idea of}} tourism in their forests. Using original survey data, the paper illustrates that private forest owners 2 ̆ 7 openness to tourism is strongly related to their interpretation of 2 ̆ 7 forest 2 ̆ 7 in metaphorical terms. The paper concludes by suggesting the best way to pursue the development of 2 ̆ 7 forest tourism 2 ̆ 7 in this community is to rely on the forest owners cooperative <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> the concept as a 2 ̆ 7 secondary forest use 2 ̆ 7, more closely reflecting forest owners 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of the forest resource...|$|R
40|$|We {{express the}} {{position}} of the Sun in the sky as a function of time and the observer's geographic coordinates. Our method is based on applying rotation matrices to vectors describing points on the celestial sphere. We also derive direct expressions, as functions of date of the year and geographic latitude, for the duration of daylight, the maximum and minimum altitudes of the Sun, and the cardinal directions to sunrise and sunset. We discuss how to account for the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, the precessions of the equinoxes and the perihelion, the size of the solar disk, and atmospheric refraction. We illustrate these results by computing the dates of "Manhattanhenge" (when sunset aligns with the east-west streets on the main traffic grid for Manhattan, in New York City), by plotting the altitude of the Sun over representative cities as a function of time, and by showing plots ("analemmas") for {{the position of}} the Sun in the sky at a given hour of the day.

40|$|International audienceTo face an {{increasingly}} competitive environment within a globalization context, and {{to focus on}} core high-added value business activities, enterprises have to establish partnerships with other companies specialized in complementary domains. Such an approach, primarily based on optimization of the value chain, is called virtualization of the Enterprise. Enterprises relying on virtualization, sub-contracting and outsourcing have to coordinate activities of all the partners, to integrate {{the results of their}} activities, to manage federated information coming from the different implied information systems and <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> them as a product for the clients. The adopted organization, which is considering as well as the internal and external resources, is called “Extended Enterprise”. Nevertheless, in such complex emerging networked organizations, it is more and more challenging to be able to interchange, to share and to manage internal and external resources such as digital information, digital services and computer-enacted processes. In addition, digital artifacts produced by enterprise activities are more and more heterogeneous and complex. After characterizing expected interoperability for collaborative platform systems and highlighting interoperability issues and brakes not yet addressed, this chapter describes an innovative approach to build interoperability based on a Federated Framework of legacy eBusiness standards of a given ecosystem. It implies facing important issues related to semantic preservation along the lifecycle of the artifacts and infrastructures required to define and exploit an application. We present two use case studies that apply interoperability strategies...|$|R
40|$|Hong Kong’s Central, {{what was}} called Government hill area, have many rich {{historic}} heritage landmarks, scattered along the Cotton tree drive, Garden road and the mid-level area of Hong Kong. We travel {{back in time to}} look at the Hong Kong’s City of Victoria map in the 19 th century. Ever since 1841, when the British settled in Hong Kong, the three pillars of colonial power, the British government, the Military and the Church, had all settled closed to each other, in the Government hill, what we now know as Central today. The military barracks, the Church and the Government house were all privileged administrative sites during Colonial rule, that’s why as of today, they still remain untouched by development. The historic heritage tells us why these areas are not being used intensely, but it also gave us a context and framework of how to use them effectively, because this history, our legacy of Hong Kong can be our vehicle to tell people about the story of this city. This thesis is an attempt <b>to</b> <b>re-package</b> them into a heritage district by using the century old road layout system as a historic trail in Central to link up the existing historic landmark for pedestrians, and by using the Hong Kong Zoological Botanical Garden and the Government house as a center for heritage education program in Hong Kong history and converting the Government house into a public museum. Connecting the Hong Kong Botanical Garden and Hong Kong Government house will bring back the historic context of the two site by using a tree walk bridge linking up the two site and bringing back the Hong Kong Herbarium into the Garden.

40|$|About 40 % ({approximately} 9, 000) of the {approximately} 23, 000 {{transuranic}} (TRU) {{waste drums}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are presently unshippable because conservative calculations {{suggest that the}} hydrogen concentration may exceed the lower explosive limit for hydrogen. This situation extends across nearly all DOE sites holding and generating TRU waste. The incorporation of a hydrogen getter such as DEB into the waste drums (or the TRUPACT II shipping containers) could substantially mitigate the explosion risk. The result would be {{to increase the number}} of drums that qualify for transportation to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) without having to resort <b>to</b> expensive <b>re-packaging</b> or waste treatment technologies. However, before this approach can be implemented, key technical questions must be answered. Foremost among these is the question of whether the presence of other chemical vapors and gases in the drum might poison the catalytic reaction between hydrogen and DEB. This is the final report of a one-year, Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The objective of this project was to obtain fundamental information on the chemical mechanism of the catalytic reaction of hydrogen with one commonly used hydrogen getter, DEB. Experiments with these materials showed that the method of exposure affects the nature of the reaction products. The results of this work contributed to the development of a mechanistic model of the reaction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the technical and}} economic feasibility of molten salt oxidation technology as a volume reduction and recovery process for {sup 238 }Pu contaminated waste. Combustible low-level waste material contaminated with {sup 238 }Pu residue is destroyed by oxidation in a 900 C molten salt reaction vessel. The combustible waste is destroyed creating carbon dioxide and steam and {{a small amount of}} ash and insoluble {sup 2328 }Pu in the spent salt. The valuable {sup 238 }Pu is recycled using aqueous recovery techniques. Experimental test results for this technology indicate a plutonium recovery efficiency of 99 %. Molten salt oxidation stabilizes the waste converting it to a non-combustible waste. Thus installation and use of molten salt oxidation technology will substantially reduce the volume of {sup 238 }Pu contaminated waste. Cost-effectiveness evaluations of molten salt oxidation indicate a significant cost savings when compared to the present plans <b>to</b> package, or <b>re-package,</b> certify and transport these wastes to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for permanent disposal. Clear and distinct cost advantages exist for MSO when the monetary value of the recovered {sup 238 }Pu is considered...|$|R
50|$|The idea <b>to</b> re-master and <b>re-package</b> the {{complete}} album {{had been around}} {{for some time and}} was taken on by bass player Martin Hadden whose business Birnam CD had been established as Scotland's leading CD and DVD production company for many years. The original master tapes were retrieved from Edinburgh's REL Studios and sent to London to be carefully (due to their age) transferred to a digital format. From there, the tracks were sent north to David Shearer at Norwick Mastering in Wick to be digitally re-mastered. As an added bonus to fans, Martin persuaded Scotland's finest music journalist Alastair Clark to briefly come out of retirement to write a fresh appreciation of the band for the release. Alastair's words were then included in the album's final package, along with gathered memorabilia such as rare archive photos, original concert tickets and posters, all of which were integrated into the final artwork by Birnam CD's graphic designer Mike Garden. The completed album was released exclusively through Birnam CD's Online Shop on 16 February 2012 and attracted orders from around the world within {{the first few days of}} going live.|$|R
