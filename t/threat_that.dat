5|$|For {{the second}} Test, Bradman {{returned}} to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by the <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> he finally raised the siege.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.|$|E

5|$|Monuments at El Cayo {{record that}} Yo'nal Ahk III was {{involved}} in burial ceremonies for a sajal in 763 AD, although he {{was not involved in}} picking the leader's successor. It is also known that during his reign, a k'ini' ajaw—or prince—of Piedras Negras, T'ul Chiik, was captured by Yaxun B'alam IV of Yaxchilan; it has been hypothesized by Martin and Grube that Yo'nal Ahk III's focus on smaller satellite kingdoms such as La Mar and El Cayo was a tactic to build up a support base in order to combat the growing <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> Yaxchilan posed. He was succeeded by Ha' K'in Xook, who was possibly his brother.|$|E

When RKO still delayed the film's release Welles offered to buy the film for $1 million and the studio finally agreed to release the film on May 1.|$|E

As Rivoli neared completion, HMS Victorious was dispatched from the Mediterranean Fleet to intercept her should she leave port. Victorious was commanded by John Talbot, a successful and popular officer who had distinguished himself with the capture of the French frigate Ville de Milan in 1805 and his service in the Dardanelles Operation of 1807. Talbot was accompanied by the 18-gun brig HMS Weazel under Commander John William Andrew.|$|E
5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals {{were well aware of}} the <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of the}} air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{fell across}} the Dominican Republic, with isolated totals of 10inches (250mm) expected. The rainfall caused flooding along the Yaque del Norte River, and initially {{there appeared to}} be a <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> the Tavera Dam along the river would fail, potentially killing thousands in Santiago Province. Officials instead opted to open all six floodgates at 0400UTC on December 12, which released about 1.6milliongallons (6.1millionliters) of water into the river every second. The deluge created a 66foot (20m) wave of water that caught many off guard due to the time of night and only about 15minutes to prepare, according to eyewitnesses who criticized the decision; the flooding killed at least 35people and left homes in seven towns flooded. Two other deaths were reported elsewhere in the country, and more than 34,000people fled their homes due to the storm; more than 7,500houses were damaged. Damage in the country was estimated at $1.5billion (2007DOP, $45million 2007USD). In neighboring Haiti, two deaths were reported in the northern portion of the country. On December 11, a station in the Turks and Caicos Islands recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h).|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) {{meet with}} an {{important}} potential client, Christian (Tim Meadows), at Chili's. The client represents the governmental paper {{interests of the}} branch's entire surrounding county, and it is mentioned that taking him on could mean Dunder-Mifflin {{will not have to}} close one of its branches – a <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> had been looming for the past year. Jan is initially disgusted with Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a hotel meeting room to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of the}} day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal. Afterwards, in the parking lot, Michael and the recently divorced Jan kiss and leave together.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E

5|$|Possible {{motivations for}} this {{complete}} rebuilding by Al-Adil include the damage the old citadel may have sustained from earthquakes in 1200 and 1201 and the <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> other Ayyubid princes continued to pose toward Al-Adil. The most likely motivation {{is that the}} defences of the old citadel became obsolete due to the introduction in the 12th century of the counterweight trebuchet, a siege engine easily capable of reducing thick stone walls to rubble. The new citadel introduced {{a number of important}} changes to the defensive system, including higher and thicker walls, a wide moat surrounding the citadel, and numerous closely spaced, high, massive towers. Unlike the older towers, these were square rather than round in design. The towers contained platforms on which trebuchets could be placed. Due to their high position, these trebuchets could outrange enemy artillery and thereby prevent them from breaching the walls.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the okapi as Endangered. It {{is fully}} {{protected}} under Congolese law. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant {{populations of the}} okapi, though {{there has been a}} steady decline in numbers due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but is bereft of protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.|$|E

Chan Ho Park came in for Happ, ending any Yankees <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> inning. Chamberlain was relieved by Dámaso Marte {{in the top of}} the seventh after allowing two baserunners, but Marte struck out Utley to end the inning scoreless. After Park allowed a single to Rodriguez, Scott Eyre replaced him. Eyre allowed Rodriguez to steal second and intentionally walked Jorge Posada but escaped the inning without allowing a run.|$|E
