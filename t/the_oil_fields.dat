5|$|After the war, Clements {{worked as}} a rigger in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> of east Texas. In 1921, however, his father's health began to fail, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky to help him on the farm and served as his deputy sheriff. As a hobby, he also coached football at his high school alma mater. One of his assistant coaches, Rodes K. Myers, {{would go on to}} be lieutenant governor under Keen Johnson. On January 18, 1927, Clements married Sara M. Blue. Their only child, Elizabeth (Bess) Hughes Clements Abell, became social secretary to Lady Bird Johnson and Walter Mondale.|$|E
5|$|The Big Inch and Little Big Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{considerable}} losses, {{in early}} 1942 Germany {{and its allies}} stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> of the Caucasus and occupy Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.|$|E

5|$|Four {{weeks into}} the campaign, the Germans {{realized}} they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies and General Bock quickly {{came to the conclusion}} that not only had the Red Army offered stiff opposition, but German difficulties were also due to the logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. He now believed he could defeat the Soviet state by economic means, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the Donbass and <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{nationalization}} of the Asian fields causes financial ruin {{that affects the}} cartel members and J.R. Ewing's banker. This leads to the suicide of cartel member Seth Stone (Buck Young). J.R. attempts to run both Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby) and Alan Beam (Randolph Powell) out of town as they both plot revenge against him. He also attempts to move Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) back into a sanitarium. With Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) having sought revenge upon J.R. based on an agreement he realized Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Digger Barnes (Keenan Wynn) had, J.R. has <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> stopped to keep Cliff from earning any royalties. Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal) and husband Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) move out of Southfork out of disgust at J.R.'s dealings. In the end, J.R. is shot while working late at the office.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December 1941, during World War II, the Japanese {{invasion}} of Borneo began. After the first landing in Miri, the Japanese moved along the coastline of Borneo from <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> of Kuching and towards Jesselton. Life in Tawau continued as usual until 24 January 1942 when the Japanese were sighted off Batu Tinagat. The district officer Cole Adams {{and his assistant}} were expecting an attack at the shipyard but were instead arrested by the Japanese. The Allies began counterattacking the Japanese in mid-1944 with the bombing of Tawau. From 13 April 1945, six massive air strikes were made on town, concentrating on the port facilities. The last and largest of these attacks was on 1 May 1945 when 19 Liberator bombers bombed Tawau until it was completely razed to the ground. After an unconditional surrender of the 37th Japanese Army under Lieutenant General Masao Baba in mid-September at Labuan, 1,100 Australian soldiers in Sandakan {{under the command of}} Lt. Col. JA England marched into the Japanese bases at Tawau. A total of 2,900 Japanese soldiers of the 370th battalion under Major Sugasaki Moriyuki were taken as prisoners of war and transferred to Jesselton.|$|E

5|$|Strong winds {{knocked out}} power and {{telephone}} lines across the eastern {{region of the}} country, leaving thousands isolated until the lines were repaired hours later. The cyclone caused extensive damage along the coastline, including {{in the city of}} Sur and the village of Ras al Hadd at the easternmost point of the Omani mainland. In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages to keep people away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> of the nation. The liquefied natural gas terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing. Around 20,000people were affected, and damage in the country was estimated at around $4.2billion (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was tasked with {{the protection of}} <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> at Ploiești, which were vital to the German war effort. They trained some Romanian officers in German Panzer tactics. Apart from training and maintaining their equipment, the soldiers {{had nothing to do}} and became bored. In March 1941 Strachwitz was sent back to Cosel in Germany where a new replacement unit was to be founded. He returned via his home town and 24 hours later a telegram from Hube called him back. This was preceded by a series of events in Belgrade. On 25 March 1941, the government of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia had signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort {{to stay out of the}} war. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović. As a result, Hitler chose not only to support Mussolini's ambitions in Albania and in the Greco-Italian War but also to attack Yugoslavia. For this purpose the mobilized forces of Panzergruppe I (1st Panzer Group) under the command of Generaloberst Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist were ordered to attack Belgrade in what would become the Invasion of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to control oil fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fields</b> had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al-Islam. The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E
