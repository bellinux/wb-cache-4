5|$|During {{the year}} 1943, U-boat losses {{amounted}} to 258 to all causes. Of this total, 90 were sunk by Coastal Command, and 51 damaged. Up until that time, in May 1943, Coastal Command had sighted submarines on 825 occasions, {{which resulted in}} 607 attacks. Only 27 were sunk, and three were shared destroyed. Another 120 were damaged. Against <b>those</b> <b>figures,</b> 233 aircraft, 116 of which were lost owing to weather conditions, were destroyed. Of this figure, 179 were from No. 19 Group RAF, attacking U-boats over the Bay of Biscay.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of <b>those</b> <b>figures</b> at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 regular season, the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I-A college football, averaging 292 rushing yards per game and 422 overall yards per game. Despite <b>those</b> <b>figures,</b> the Cornhuskers' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their participation was in doubt. Ahman Green, who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries, 917 rushing yards, and seven touchdowns, suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the second-to-last Nebraska regular-season game. The No. 2 rusher, DeAngelo Evans, had 776 rushing yards and a team-high 14 rushing touchdowns, but was limited by a groin injury. Because of the injuries, Damon Benning, who earned 465 yards and seven touchdowns during the regular seasons, was anticipated to see significant playing time. Wide receiver Brenden Holbein also suffered an ankle injury in practice, but was able to play.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic {{festivals and}} built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, {{messenger}} of the gods. <b>Those</b> <b>figures</b> {{may be related to}} the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India (such as the Lingam), Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed <b>those</b> <b>figures</b> and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
