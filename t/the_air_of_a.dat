5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: {{she looks like a}} girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The Point {{was formed}} by {{longshore}} drift and this movement continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of hooks along {{the south side of}} the spit. Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves and in front of the coasts sheltered by the spit, and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the grass at its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E

25|$|The {{producer}} initially sought actor Richard Griffiths {{to succeed}} Baker, {{but when he}} proved unavailable, cast Peter Davison, {{with whom he had}} previously worked on the popular drama series All Creatures Great and Small. Davison was very different from his four predecessors, being much younger, in line with Nathan-Turner's desire for the Fifth Doctor to be completely unlike the popular Fourth, so that the public would not draw unfavourable comparisons between the two. Davison's Doctor was arguably the most human of them all, and the one whose vulnerability was emphasised the most. The Fifth Doctor, more often than not, reacted to circumstances around him rather than being proactive, and had <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young aristocrat about him, in contrast to Baker's bohemian personality.|$|E
500|$|Longfellow was {{the most}} popular poet of his day. [...] As a friend once wrote, [...] "no other poet was so fully {{recognized}} in his lifetime". Many of his works helped shape the American character and its legacy, particularly with the poem [...] "Paul Revere's Ride". He was such an admired figure in the United States during his life that his 70th birthday in 1877 took on <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national holiday, with parades, speeches, and the reading of his poetry.|$|E
500|$|At a {{state dinner}} given by Pierce, Benjamin first met Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, whose wife Varina {{described}} the Louisiana senator as having [...] "rather <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> witty bon vivant than {{of a great}} senator". The two men, both ambitious for leadership in the South and the nation, formed a relationship that Evans describes as [...] "respectful but wary". The two had occasional differences; when in 1858, Davis, by then a Mississippi senator, was irritated by Benjamin's questioning him on a military bill and suggested that Benjamin was acting as a paid attorney, the Louisianan challenged him to a duel. Davis apologized.|$|E
50|$|Combes made a {{dramatic}} national television appearance that {{year on the}} NBC series Real People.

50|$|In 2009, BBC2 {{commissioned}} a six-part series titled Grandma's House from Tiger Aspect Productions, written by and starring Amstell, co-written by Dan Swimer.

500|$|Bacon's {{relationships}} {{prior to}} Dyer {{had all been}} with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself, but each had been the dominating presence. Peter Lacy, his first lover, would often tear up the young artist's paintings, beat him up in drunken rages, and leave {{him on the street}} half-conscious. Bacon was attracted to Dyer's vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon's self-confidence and his artistic success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man. Dyer was, like Bacon, a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance. Pale-faced and a chain-smoker, Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again. His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality; the art critic Michael Peppiatt described him as having <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man who could [...] "land a decisive punch". Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair, and by 1970, Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk.|$|E
500|$|Writer's {{assistant}} Karen Wilkie {{can be seen}} in {{the audience}} during Seinfeld's stand-up comedy act. Nurit Koppel portrayed Rava, at the time she was known for her appearance in the CBS television movie Sweet Bird of Youth (1989) as well as a guest appearance on the NBC crime drama Hunter. Jane Leeves, who would later appear as Marla the Virgin in season four and season nine also auditioned for the part, she also went on to star in the popular NBC sitcom Frasier (1993–2004). In the script, Ray Thomas' description was, [...] "although he carries cleaning equipment, he also carries <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pretentious mannerly, affected actor". Various actors auditioned for the part, among which were Hank Azaria, Michael D. Conway and Tony Shalhoub, who had also auditioned for the part of Kramer. Conway was eventually cast for the part. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra; he appears in the background when Jerry and Ray talk at Monk's Cafe.|$|E
500|$|A further development, {{known as}} Hazel Court (after Alfred Hazel, {{principal}} 1925–1944), {{was built in}} 2000, bringing {{the total number of}} students who can be housed at the sports ground to 135. Writing in the Royal Institute of British Architects Journal in 2002, Jeremy Melvin praised the architects of Hazel Court, Maguire & Co., for their [...] "crispness of detail" [...] and [...] "richness of composition"; he said that [...] "the sense of ordered space... recalls {{the way in which the}} traditional collegiate quads gave architectural expression to the then-new idea of a university". He noted that, whilst the first impression of the houses was Elizabethan with <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> courtyard garden, [...] "closer inspection reveals a contemporary design sensibility"; there was, he wrote, [...] "the impression of an order that comes from making the construction explicit whils combining sensitivity to function and use". However, he commented that whilst there was plenty of space inside, the furniture [...] "would not look out of place in a motorway hotel".|$|E
50|$|VH1 Storytellers is {{a concert}} and {{discussion}} DVD by Bruce Springsteen, expanded from <b>the</b> <b>airing</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> episode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VH1 television series VH1 Storytellers on April 23, 2005.

50|$|The {{station is}} {{recognised}} {{as being the}} first in the world to play any new single released by U2, due to the band's long-term friendship with Dave Fanning.

500|$|... "From a View to a Kill" [...] was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of the novel Moonraker. The story would have taken place during World War II, and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later, the hospital is bombed, leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face. The story was one that Fleming had drawn up for the television series. The SHAPE head of security, Colonel Schreiber, {{was designed to be}} the antithesis of Bond, with greying hair, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bank manager, desk with silver framed photographs of his family and a single white rose; the description shows Fleming using colour to show Schreiber's lack of colour and personality. The idea of the underground hideout was inspired by Fleming's brother Peter's band of Auxiliary Units who dug tunnel networks in Britain in 1940 as part of a resistance movement in advance of a German invasion. The original name for the story was [...] "The Rough with the Smooth", which was also the original title of the books, before For Your Eyes Only was chosen for publication.|$|E
500|$|Lambert {{shared his}} {{interests}} {{and knowledge of}} sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his [...] "even if the King were present" [...] but Lambert replied that [...] "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2005, Nesbitt {{had become}} {{tired of the}} formula and {{threatened}} to quit unless {{the structure of the}} series was changed. He was made a creative consultant and suggested that Murphy keep one undercover role for a full series, instead of changing into a new guise every episode. This new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real-life undercover work. Alongside his research with former undercover officer Peter Bleksley, Nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a handlebar moustache to change Murphy's physical characteristics and tone down the [...] "cheeky chappie" [...] persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles. With his trainer, he worked out three times a week, boxing and doing circuits and weights. After the first new episode was broadcast, Sarah Vine wrote in The Times, [...] "In the past, when attempting a nasty stare or a hard face, Nesbitt has never managed much more than a faintly quizzical look, hilarity forever threatening to break out behind those twinkly Irish eyes. But here, it's different. He genuinely has <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man who means business." [...] The refreshed series marked another milestone in Nesbitt's career; he describes it as [...] "a big moment" [...] in his life. Murphy's Law was not recommissioned for a sixth series, which Nesbitt attributed to the damage done to the fifth series ratings when it was scheduled opposite the popular ITV drama Doc Martin.|$|E

2500|$|The writer John Cowper Powys, an admirer, wrote that, [...] "with the {{possible}} exception of Merope, Matthew Arnold's poetry is arresting from cover to cover – [...] is the great amateur of English poetry [...] always has <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ironic and urbane scholar chatting freely, perhaps a little indiscreetly, with his not very respectful pupils." ...|$|R
500|$|Jackson was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 1July 1941. By now his younger brother Ed had been posted to No.3 Squadron and was serving with him in Palestine. With the campaign in Syria concluding in mid-July, the unit undertook no operations in August and personnel went on leave before returning to action in Egypt the next month. The rural-bred Jackson took to the night life in Alexandria, but his stay at a first-class hotel left him bewildered as {{to the purpose of}} the room's bidet, which he eventually determined was [...] "some feminine arrangement". Peter Ewer, in Storm Over Kokoda, observed: [...] "There was something of the patrician about John Jackson, but his well-to-do background had a distinctly Australian tinge to it. He liked a game of cards, with a bet on the outcome." [...] In Whispering Death, Mark Johnston noted that although [...] "tall and blue-eyed", he [...] "did not have <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'boy's own' or movie star pilot", but rather was [...] "balding, ambling and no extrovert". Jackson returned to Australia in November 1941. He was mentioned in despatches, and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for his [...] "marked keenness and determination" [...] during operations with No.3 Squadron in the Middle East. The former award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 1January 1942 and the latter, which listed him as [...] "John Henry Jackson", on 7April. The DFC was presented to Jackson's widow Elisabeth, after his death.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Cherry {{points out}} that Chamberlain was an egotist, {{he added that he}} had good {{relationships}} with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." [...] Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles. During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of [...] "copping out" [...] in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: [...] "There was a thing almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." [...] Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been [...] "more physical" [...] with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for [...] "intellectualizing" [...] basketball in a negative way.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. How else to explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E
