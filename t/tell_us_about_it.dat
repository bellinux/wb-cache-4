60|$|DORAN [jovially]. Never mind. Come along all {{the same}} and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> over a frenly glass.|$|E
60|$|We both send a {{power of}} love to the Howellses, and we do wish you were here. Are you in the new house? <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I {{love to hear}} {{brave men}} fight their battles over," [...] she cried, with a look half pleading, half commanding, and wholly charming.|$|E
60|$|COLLINS. Bless you, maam, {{she done}} it five times {{to my own}} knowledge; and then George gave up <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he got so used to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I {{shall be}} glad {{to be able to}} believe that there is some redeeming feature in this strange business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here," [...] said Nootka, {{holding out}} a piece of half-cooked blubber to the boy, [...] "sit down and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> What is the news?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> lassie," [...] {{said the}} Major. [...] "If I judge right there's some sixty pages in that epistle. Don't bother {{to read it}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Peter Rabbit, {{stretching}} {{himself out}} in the soft grass {{on the edge of}} the Smiling Pool. [...] "Do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Please do, Grandfather Frog!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Peter Rabbit. [...] "Do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it!</b> I {{just love}} secrets." [...] There {{was a great}} deal of eagerness in Peter's voice, and it made Grandfather Frog smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Matteo {{has been}} <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Francis, and that he, and {{everyone}} else, owed their {{escape from the}} dungeons of Genoa entirely to your cleverness." ...|$|R
40|$|The prime {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the analysis and the understanding of the underlying architectural principles (ideas) behind the particular seminar work that they have been given. Although this study is limited to one building its real significance lies not only in what <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but also what <b>it</b> reveals <b>about</b> architecture itself. By distilling and comparing these buildings and stripping away the circumstances of their creation, we are shown universal principles of their design. This universality invites comparison to other buildings far removed in time and place...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is 'e? 'Nother Colonial rebel to be 'orribly disenfranchised, or a Cape Minister, or only a loyal farmer with {{dynamite}} in both boots. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Burjer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind us, Dorothy," [...] said Billina. [...] "Go {{inside and}} see what the place is like. You can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> afterward, and Toto and I will rest comfortably here until you return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] Edwin counselled soothingly. [...] "Granser's all right. He's just gettin' to the Scarlet Death, ain't you, Granser? He's just goin' to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> right now. Sit down, Hare-Lip. Go ahead, Granser." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! We {{shall be}} inconsolable without you! Unless {{you have a}} spade, Mr. Sampson, the game is mine. Good-bye, my child! No more about your journey at present: <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when you come back!" [...] And she gaily bade him farewell. He looked for a moment piteously at her, and was gone.|$|E
6000|$|And Evans, who admires Clayton immensely and {{has been}} four weeks in America, shouted, [...] "CAUGHT a ghost, did you, Clayton? I'm glad of <b>it!</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it</b> right now." ...|$|R
50|$|Venom (Special) - Steve <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> venom, how <b>it</b> {{works and}} how to cure it.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have already}} been enough books about the Bush administration's war on terror to fill several shelves in a library. Most are either {{strongly}} pro or con with not enough dispassionate analysis. Ron Suskind's The Way of the World {{is something of a}} hybrid. Rather than looking at the subject from 10,000 feet above ground, <b>it</b> <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> through the stories of government operatives, a defense lawyer, and two citizens of Muslim countries living in the United States. It is critical of President Bush and his policies but makes its points by example rather than by taking cheap shots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Eccles {{was going}} to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> when you entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I suggest that you take no notice of this {{addition}} to your audience, and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has just}} {{returned}} from an Austrian prison where, as I told you when you joined me, he was carried after Hochkirch. I don't know yet how he escaped. He must dine with me this evening, and afterwards he shall <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Mitchell dines with us, also. He, too, is a friend of this young soldier, and has a high opinion of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} congratulated you yet," [...] the countess said, [...] "upon your last promotion. Lieutenant Lindsay {{came over to}} <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and how you had gained it. Of course we were greatly pleased, {{although}} grieved to hear that you had been made prisoner. We wondered whether, {{at the time you}} were captured, you had any of the letters I had written with you, and whether they would come in useful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Tot. You {{mentioned}} it to me, but we couldn't go into details at the time," [...] said her father, puffing a vigorous cloud of smoke into the chimney.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> himself. I am {{sure that}} you will join with me in {{welcoming}} Harry's boy heartily, and in my satisfaction that he has proved himself well worthy of his race." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Write <b>us</b> often, and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> dear," [...] said Susan, as she {{sat beside}} Maude and held her hand; Tom had Biddy on his knee. Maude was pale, but smiling and composed.|$|R
6000|$|... "What d'you {{take any}} notice of those rotters for?" [...] said Stalky, playing {{substitute}} for the Old Boys, magnificent in black jersey, white knickers, and black stockings. [...] "I talked to {{him up in the}} dormitory when he was changin'. Pulled his sweater down for him. He's cut about all over the arms--horrid purply ones. He's goin' to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to-night. I asked him to when I was lacin' his boots." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, dat's fine, boy. I been {{watching}} yuh, and I sees y' wasn't cut {{out to be}} no saloon porter. I made a little bet with meself you was ejucated. Why, y'r cuffs ain't even doity--not very doity. Course you kinda need a shave, but dem little blond hairs don't show much. I seen you was a gentleman, even if de bums didn't. You're too good t' be a rum-peddler. Glad y're going, boy, mighty glad. Sit down. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We'll miss yuh here. I was just saying th' other night to Mike here dere ain't one feller in a hundred could 'a' stood de kiddin' from an old he-one like me and kep' his mout' shut and grinned and said nawthin' to nobody. Dat's w'at wins fights. But, say, boy, I'll miss yuh, I sure will. I get {{to be kind of}} lonely as de boys drop off--like boozers always does. Oh, hell, I won't spill me troubles like an old tissy-cat.... So you're going to Panama? I want yuh to sit down and tell me about it. Whachu taking, boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{impossible}} to deal at any length with the picture given in these remarkable letters of the gradual progress and amalgamation of two spirits of great natural potency and independence, without saying at least {{a word about the}} moral question raised by their publication and the many expressions of disapproval which it entails. To the mind of the present writer the whole of such a question should be tested by one perfectly clear intellectual distinction and comparison. I am not prepared to admit that there is or can be, properly speaking, in the world anything that is too sacred to be known. That spiritual beauty and spiritual truth are in their nature communicable, and that they should be communicated, is a principle which lies at the root of every conceivable religion. Christ was crucified upon a hill, and not in a cavern, and the word Gospel itself involves the same idea as the ordinary name of a daily paper. Whenever, therefore, a poet or any similar type of man can, or conceives that he can, make all men partakers in some splendid secret of his own heart, I can imagine nothing saner and nothing manlier than his course in doing so. Thus it was that Dante made a new heaven and a new hell out of a girl's nod in the streets of Florence. Thus it was that Paul founded a civilisation by keeping an ethical diary. But the one essential which exists in all such cases as these is that the man in question believes that he can make the story as stately to the whole world as it is to him, and he chooses his words to that end. Yet when a work contains expressions which have one value and significance when read by the people to whom they were addressed, and an entirely different value and significance when read by any one else, then the element of the violation of sanctity does arise. It is not because there is anything in this world too sacred to tell. It is rather because there are a great many things in this world too sacred to parody. If Browning could really convey to the world the inmost core of his affection for his wife, I see no reason why he should not. But the objection to letters which begin [...] "My dear Ba," [...] is that they do not convey anything of the sort. As far as any third person is concerned, Browning {{might as well have been}} expressing the most noble and universal sentiment in the dialect of the Cherokees. Objection to the publication of such passages as that, in short, is not the fact that they tell us about the love of the Brownings, but that they do not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|SEVERAL YOUTHS AND MAIDENS [rising {{and rushing}} to him] No, no. Dont go. Dont be offended. We {{want to see}} the {{artificial}} pair. We will listen. We are tremendously interested. <b>Tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} sweet {{of you to}} come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A general dissatisfaction {{diffused}} itself, and Hewson felt it; but he disdained to {{do anything}} to appease it. He remained silent for that appreciable time which elapsed before his host said, almost compassionately, [...] "Won't you <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Hewson." ...|$|R
6000|$|Certainly you are disinterested about America, and, of course, {{all of us}} {{who have}} hearts and heads must feel the sympathy of a greater nation to be more {{precious}} than a thick purse. Still, it is not just and dignified, this vantage ground of American pirates. Liking the ends and motives, one disapproves the means. Yes, even you do; and if I were an American I should dissent with still more emphasis. It should be made a point of honour with the nation, if there is no point of law against the re publishers. For my own part, I have every possible reason to thank and love America; she has been very kind to me, and the visits we receive here from delightful and cordial persons of that country have been most gratifying to us. The American minister at the court of Vienna, with his family, did not pass through Florence the other day without coming to see us--General Watson Webbe-with an air of moral as well as military command in his brow and eyes. He looked, and talked too, like one of oar dignities of the Old World. The go-ahead principle didn't seem the least over-strong in him, nor likely to disturb his official balance. What is to happen next in France? Do you trust still your President? He is in a hard position, and, if he leaves the Pope where he is, in a dishonored one. As for the change in the electoral law and the increase of income, I see nothing in either to make an outcry against. There is great injustice everywhere and a rankling party-spirit, and to speak the truth and act it appears still more difficult than usual. I was sorry, do you know, to hear of dear Mr. Horne's attempt at Shylock; he is fit for higher things. Did I tell you how we received and admired his Judas Iscariot? Yes, surely I did. He says that Louis Blanc is a friend of his and much with him, speaking with enthusiasm. I should be more sorry at his being involved with the Socialists than with Shylock--still more sorry; for I love liberty so intensely that I hate Socialism. I hold it to be the most desecrating and dishonouring to humanity of all creeds. I would rather (for me) live under the absolutism of Nicholas of Russia than in a Fourier machine, with my individuality sucked out of me by a social air-pump. Oh, if you happen to write again to Mrs. Deane, thank her much for her kind anxiety; but, indeed, if I had lost my darling I should not write verses about it.[202] As for the Laureateship, it won't be given to me, be sure, though the suggestion has gone the round of the English newspapers--'Galignani' and all--and notwithstanding that most kind and flattering recommendation of the 'Athenaeum,' for which I am sure we should be grateful to Mr. Chorley. I think Leigh Hunt should have the Laureateship. He has condescended to wish for it, and has 'worn his singing clothes' longer than most of his contemporaries, deserving the price of long as well as noble service. Whoever has it will be, of course, exempted from Court lays; and the distinction of the title and pension should remain for Spenser's sake, if not for Wordsworth's. We are very anxious to know about Tennyson's new work, 'In Memoriam.' Do <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You are aware that it was written years ago, and relates to a son of Mr. Hallam, who was Tennyson's intimate friend and the betrothed of his sister. I have heard, through someone who had seen the MS., that it is full of beauty and pathos.... Dearest, ever dear Miss Mitford, speak particularly of your health. May God bless you, prays ...|$|E

5000|$|The Huffington Post {{offers an}} {{explanation}} to the vague nondescript language {{used throughout the}} song: [...] "Our guide, our word-playing, rhyming, subtle, subtextual, double-meaning beacon of logic and reason is utterly unable to comprehend {{the death of his}} son, rendered speechless. By telling us that he can't <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> Miranda shows us Hamilton's despair".|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the film, Fassbinder {{attempts}} {{to demonstrate the}} effects of the restraints of society on the suppression of emotions. [...] This is done by distancing the audience from the action, primarily through techniques such as keeping the most dramatic scenes off-screen and the segmentation of events. [...] For instance, there is never a single scene depicting the affair between Effi and Crampas, with all of it remaining off-screen. [...] And rather than being shown Annie’s birth, the narrator rather <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> further separating the audience from the action. [...] With such techniques the audience is denied the melodramatic scenes expected from a film about adultery, using this restraint to heighten the theme of repression.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a surprise," [...] went on Anderson, rather huskily. [...] "My Lord! But it's only {{round the}} corner for every man.... Come on, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> an' {{the rest of the}} bad news.... Get it over. Then, mebbe Lenore n' me--" ...|$|R
