5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted into <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> {{due to a}} more northerly {{storm track}} and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Northwest</b> and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
