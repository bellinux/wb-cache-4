25|$|It was {{not until}} 1826 that an Irish sea captain, Peter Dillon, found enough {{evidence}} {{to piece together the}} events of <b>the</b> <b>tragedy.</b> <b>In</b> Tikopia (one of the islands of Santa Cruz), he bought some swords that he had reason to believe had belonged to Lapérouse or his officers. He made enquiries, and found that they came from nearby Vanikoro, where two big ships had broken up years earlier. Dillon managed to obtain a ship in Bengal, and sailed for the coral atoll of Vanikoro where he found cannonballs, anchors and other evidence of the remains of ships in water between coral reefs.|$|E

25|$|After being stunned in {{the first}} {{championship}} by <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>in</b> Lviv, Dynamo Kyiv were anxious to earn their first title at the second opportunity. In the second Ukrainian championship, which had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rivals of the Kyivians were Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, who were top after {{the first half of}} the season. By the end of the season both teams were neck and neck and at the end they finished with the same number of points. The championship title was awarded to Dynamo Kyiv as they had a better goal difference. Neither the Golden match, nor the fact that Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk had a better head-to-head record was considered.|$|E

500|$|Politically, as Bangladeshi {{historian}} Farida Majid would note, the [...] "warmth, {{care and}} goodwill" [...] of the August 1971 concerts [...] "echoed {{all over the}} world", inspiring volunteers to approach UNICEF and offer their assistance, as well as eliciting private donations to the Bangladesh disaster fund. Although the altruistic spirit would soon wane once more, the Concert for Bangladesh is invariably seen as the inspiration and model for subsequent rock charity benefits, from 1985's Live Aid and Farm Aid to the Concert for New York City and Live 8 in the twenty-first century. Unlike those later concerts, which benefitted from continuous {{media coverage of the}} causes they supported, the Harrison–Shankar project was responsible for identifying the problem and establishing Bangladesh's plight in the minds of mainstream Western society. According to Gary Tillery: [...] "Because of its positioning as a humanitarian effort, all descriptions of the show included a summary of the catastrophe in South Asia. Overnight, because of their fascination with rock stars, masses of people became educated about geopolitical events they had not even been aware of the week before. <b>The</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>in</b> Bangladesh moved to the fore as an international issue." [...] One of these revelations was that America was supplying weaponry and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan.|$|E

SIDE had produced intelligence reports stating that the overthrow of the national government had been openly advocated in piqueteros' assemblies, and that these were attended by the extremist group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

2500|$|Lord Clarendon, alarmed {{that this}} might mean rebellion, asked for special powers. Lord John Russell was not {{sympathetic}} to this appeal. Lord Clarendon believed that the landlords themselves were mostly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>in</b> the first place, saying that [...] "It is quite true that landlords in England {{would not like to}} be shot like hares and partridges...but neither does any landlord in England turn out fifty persons at once and burn their houses over their heads, giving them no provision for the future." [...] The Crime and Outrage Act was passed in December 1847 as a compromise, and additional troops were sent to Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Mackenzie {{notes the}} {{tradition}} of seeing Hamlet as the most varied of Shakespeare's creations: [...] "With the strongest purposes of revenge he is irresolute and inactive; amidst the gloom of the deepest melancholy he is gay and jocular; and while he {{is described as a}} passionate lover he seems indifferent about the object of his affections." [...] Like Richardson, Mackenzie concludes that <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>in</b> the play arises from Hamlet's nature: even the best qualities of his character merely reinforce his inability to cope with the world in which he is placed. To this analysis Thomas Robertson adds in particular the devastating impact of the death of Hamlet's father.|$|E

As the play later was edited to become <b>the</b> <b>Tragedy</b> of Tragedies, critics like Alberto Rivero noted its impact on Fielding's later plays.|$|R

2500|$|The Armenian side officially {{asserts that}} the killings {{occurred}} {{as a result of}} wartime military operations, and were caused by the prevention of the evacuation of town inhabitants by Azerbaijani forces, who shot those who attempted to flee. This explanation however is widely disputed, among others, the executive director of Human Rights Watch has stated that: [...] "we place direct responsibility for the civilian deaths with Karabakh Armenian forces. Indeed, neither our report nor that of Memorial includes any evidence to support the argument that Azerbaijani forces obstructed the flight of, or fired on Azeri civilians". British journalist Thomas de Waal noted that [...] "the overwhelming evidence of what happened has not stopped some Armenians, in distasteful fashion, trying to muddy the waters". However, De Waal has also stated that <b>the</b> <b>tragedy</b> <b>in</b> Khojaly was a result of a chaotic situation, and not a [...] "deliberately planned" [...] action by the Armenians.|$|E
