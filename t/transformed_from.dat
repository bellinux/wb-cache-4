5|$|In the 1990s, Hezbollah <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> {{a revolutionary}} group into a {{political}} one, in a process which is described as the Lebanonisation of Hezbollah.

50|$|In the 1990s, {{transforming}} playsets were released. Some could <b>transform</b> <b>from</b> one playset to another, such as {{a factory}} to a test track. Others could <b>transform</b> <b>from</b> giant vehicles to playsets, {{such as a}} 6x6 to a jungle. Earlier ones included one that could <b>transform</b> <b>from</b> a toolbox to a city. Another innovative release was a line of special boats in the 1990s. While past boats had merely sunk and were not intended for water use, these new sets could actually float.|$|R

5|$|The 1994 film Exit to Eden, based loosely on {{the book}} Rice {{published}} as Anne Rampling, starred Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd. The work was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a BDSM-themed love story into a police comedy, and was widely considered a box-office failure, receiving near-universal negative reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevailing}} lowland {{forest ecosystem}} was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> forest to grassland; {{some of this}} change {{was caused by the}} use of fire, but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian (or Pacific) rat.|$|E
5|$|A major {{turning point}} for the {{movement}} came during World War I, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|As the freeholders {{shared the}} mineral royalties, the mines brought {{prosperity}} which {{gave rise to}} the remodelling and redevelopment of much of the village. Green Terrace, which includes the old post office, was built in the 1870s, and Main Street was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a back lane into the high street. The village school, with working clock and bell tower, was built by the community in 1874, and the stone-built Ibbotson Institute, now the community hall, was completed in 1903.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, the FVdG was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a localist union {{federation}} into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies. The process was initiated by the death of Gustav Keßler, the most important ideologue in the FVdG, in 1903. His role was largely assumed by the physician Raphael Friedeberg.|$|E

5|$|Ottoman {{records from}} 1906 show around 5,000 Circassians living in Amman and {{virtually}} no inhabitants who spoke Arabic. The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision {{to construct the}} Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Because of its location along the railway, Amman was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a small village into a major commercial hub in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the extension to Kew Gardens brought significant growth to Queens, specifically in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. With the subway providing a quick and cheap commute, Forest Hills became a more desirable place to live, {{and as a result}} new apartment buildings were built in advance of the line's opening to accommodate the expected influx of residents. Forest Hills was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a quiet residential community of one-family houses to an active population center.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a Hindu {{centre of}} worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned, its preservation being {{due in part to the}} fact that its moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E

5|$|With the English Reformation and the {{breaking}} of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> {{a largely}} {{agricultural}} hinterland to an important industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles. The economy <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. Canals and railroads were used for transporting raw materials and finished goods. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.|$|E

5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> {{a client}} {{kingdom of the}} Roman Empire into an {{imperial}} province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten the social order.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> a state {{dominated}} by agriculture to {{one with a}} more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{decline from}} {{the turn of}} the 20th century, coupled with the {{building}} of Gateshead's first council estate, saw Carr Hill <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> an industrial settlement into a residential suburb of the Gateshead Council ward of Deckham. Governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party, the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared to other areas of the borough and nationally, with high levels of unemployment and low levels of income. It is served by Carr Hill Primary School. There are two small parks that contribute to the social activity of the area, as does the Elgin Centre at Elgin Road. Two historic venues, both now closed, face uncertain futures, as does the parish church.|$|E
