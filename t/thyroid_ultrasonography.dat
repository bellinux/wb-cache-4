40|$|Because of the {{widespread}} use of <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> many thyroid lesions, even thyroid cancers, can be detected early. For these small lesions, planning of the management of thyroid cancers, especially papillary thyroid cancers, is different from previous guidelines.

In addition, there are some lesions which are undetermined by fine-needle aspiration cytology, and the planning should be different from those with a definite preoperative diagnosis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology could help the planning of the extent of thyroidectomy and further management.

In the literature, {{there is no}} study investigating the coexistence of colonic polyps and thyroid nodules.

Sixty-six patients with colonic polyps and 146 patients without colonic polyps enrolled into the study. Age and sex matched control group was composed from patients without colonic polyps. Colonoscopic examinations, <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonographies</b> were performed in all patients, and TSH were measured. Results.

40|$|Recent {{guidelines}} {{for the evaluation of}} thyroid nodules clarify the diagnostic algorithm while also reporting important differences. The performance of fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytological examination follows serum TSH determination and <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended following a low TSH value and/or FNA yielding an indeterminate follicular cytology. The use of <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is the source of some controversy: though it is recommended as a principal first test, its real-time use to guide FNA ranges from routine to only following an FNA yielding an inadequate or nondiagnostic cytological result. In clinical practice, the proportion of physicians utilizing ultrasonography, scintigraphy and FNA varies and frequently deviates from recommended guidelines. The development of guidelines is necessary to bring about consistency and optimization to the diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules. It is likely that novel diagnostic procedures, such as molecular markers, large needle aspiration biopsy and thyroid imaging with tracers beyond conventional radioactive iodine or (99 m) Tc pertechnetate, will lead to improved performance and implementation of guidelines...|$|E
40|$|The {{convenience}} and non-invasiveness of <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> {{have made it}} the first choice for initial assessment of thyroid nodules. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is usually performed immediately after observation by ultrasonography or under its guidance. Quick staining methods have enabled a diagnosis {{of the nature of}} thyroid nodules within minutes. However, in cases where many nodules are present at the same time, it can be unclear as to which one to pick for FNAC. When a nodule is suspected to be malignant, FNAC is also needed. If clinicians can accurately identify with ultrasonography the characteristics of thyroid nodules with high risks of malignancy or benignity, there would be a faster and more accurate determination of whether FNAC is required, thereby leading to a faster and more accurate diagnosis or rule-out of thyroid cancers and a potential decrease in the burden of healthcare and other costs. The present review identifies these characteristics so that results of <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> can be maximized and FNAC only used when necessary...|$|E
40|$|Enhancement in <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was {{investigated}} with thyroid lymphography by injection of Lipiodol into thyroid nodules in 50 patients. On plain <b>thyroid</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (PU), the echo levels of normal and tumorous {{portions of the}} thyroid glands were evaluated. Then, the echo level ratios (P-N/T) were calculated. Moreover, by the same method, the echo level ratios between normal and tumorous portions of the thyroid glands were culculated 6 hours after Lipiodol injection (E-N/T), when the greatest enhancement was anticipated. The mean value of P-N/T was 1. 305, and that of E-N/T was 1. 474. The echo level ratio was significantly elevated in the enhancement method (p< 0. 0014).

Cut-off levels of 4 – 5 mU TSH/l have been conven-tionally used to diagnose an elevated TSH serum concentration. Recent data from large population studies have suggested a much lower TSH cut-off with an upper limit of 2 – 2. 5 mU/l but application of strict criteria for inclusion of subjects from the general population studies aiming at assessing TSH reference intervals (no personal or family history of thyroid disease, no thyroid antibodies and a normal <b>thyroid</b> on <b>ultrasonography)</b> did not result in an unequivocal upper limit of normal TSH at 2. 0 – 2. 5 mU/l.

Lingual region in the most common site of thyroid ectopy but ectopic thyroid tissue were found in other head and neck locations. Nevertheless, aberrant ectopic thyroid tissue has been found in other places distant from the neck region.
