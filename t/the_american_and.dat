5|$|After the war, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals who had fought against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld. There were 277 recognized guerrilla units out of over a thousand claimed and 260,715 individuals were recognized from nearly 1.3 million claims. These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and veterans who have served for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros. Resistance leaders Wendell Fertig, Russell W. Volckmann and Donald Blackburn would incorporate what they've learned fighting with the Filipino guerrillas in establishing {{what would become the}} U.S. Special Forces.|$|E

5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law {{would have allowed}} him to produce an unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script. Sullivan had previously only written {{in his spare time}} while working as a clerk for Lee, Higginson & Co., a Boston investment bank. Although he doubted that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> South Korean forces {{approached}} the Chinese defenses, they {{were met with}} grenades, Bangalore torpedoes, shaped charges and rocks. Unable to safely advance, American and South Korean troops were forced to rely on close-support artillery to subdue Chinese resistance, but a complex network of bunkers and tunnels allowed the Chinese to bring up reinforcements as the above-ground troops were depleted. Although the 31st Infantry Regiment was equipped with ballistic vests in the first mass military deployment of modern personal armor; its 1st and 3rd battalions nevertheless suffered 96 fatalities, with an additional 337 men wounded in the first attack – the heaviest casualties the 31st Infantry Regiment had suffered {{in a single day}} during the war.|$|E

5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and {{confidence of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), which was already high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E
5|$|Captain America: The First Avenger {{opened on}} July 22, 2011, in the United States and earned $4 million in midnight showings, outgrossing other 2011 {{original}} superhero films like Thor and Green Lantern {{as well as}} the prequel , which all made between $3.25 million and $3.5 million in Friday midnights.

5|$|En {{route to}} Sicily, sixty-five gliders {{released}} too early by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> British towing aircraft {{crashed into the}} sea, drowning approximately 252 men. Of the remainder, only eighty-seven men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge, although they successfully captured the bridge and held it beyond {{the time they were}} to be relieved. Finally, with their ammunition expended and only fifteen soldiers remaining unwounded, the Allied troops surrendered to Italian forces. The Italians, having gained control of the bridge, sought to destroy the structure, but were frustrated by troopers of the 1st Airlanding Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges. Other troops from the brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily, aided further by destroying communications links and capturing gun batteries.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other works {{that are still}} being performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E
