25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.|$|E
500|$|When J. Robert Oppenheimer {{began working}} on the nuclear weapon design for the Manhattan Project during World War II, Lawrence loaned Greene {{part-time}} to take dictation and do general secretarial work for Oppenheimer, while still working full-time for himself. [...] "When Robert returned from travel and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> just been to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'" [...] she later recalled. Lawrence reluctantly let her go. She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.|$|E
2500|$|After his death, Powell's friend Richard Ritchie {{recorded}} in 1998 that [...] "during {{one of the}} habitual coal crises of recent years he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no objection to supporting the coal industry, either through the restriction of cheap coal imports or subsidy, {{if it were the}} country's wish to preserve local coal communities".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Grace's illness {{developed}} [...] "after {{sleeping in a}} damp hotel bed". Gilbert, who stayed at the hotel for several days, later wrote to The Daily Telegraph: [...] "It having come to my knowledge there is a rumour abroad that Mr. G. F. Grace's fatal illness was caused by sleeping in a damp bed at the Red Lion Hotel, Basingstoke, I beg to contradict it. He had a bad cold before he left home, and on my arrival at Basingstoke he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received another chill whilst waiting at Reading Station. By inserting this you will greatly oblige me, and also {{do justice to the}} members of a family whose attention and kindness to my cousin all through his illness could not have been surpassed had he been at home". The [...] "damp bed" [...] story is refuted by evidence to the contrary, as described above, because Grace's illness began with the cold he caught during the match at The Oval and he was already ill when he arrived in Basingstoke.|$|E
2500|$|As {{soon as the}} {{deadline}} for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted {{of a series of}} conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions. [...] "I had a couple of conversations with Ross [...] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing.

During a Q & A session following his opening statement, Arum further explained, [...] "We have never talked to anybody on the Mayweather side and all conversations on our part were through Ross Greenburg and he reported on all conversations on the Mayweather side from Al Haymon." ...|$|E

Nowhere was the name Richard Schaefer or Golden Boy mentioned, although I read, as you all did, Oscar's statement that a deal was close, so I assumed from that Haymon was keeping Schaefer and Golden Boy abreast of the situation.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In {{the midst of this}} talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.
