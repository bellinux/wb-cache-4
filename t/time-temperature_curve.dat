Both load bearing and non-load bearing full scale fire tests were performed on LSF walls configurations with varying number of plasterboard linings, and stud section sizes.

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the sealing ability and the thermal insulating capability of four different cavity lining materials. Materials and Methods: Forty noncarious human mandibular second premolars that were extracted for orthodontic treatment were collected, cleaned, and stored in distilled water. These premolars were randomly divided into four groups of ten teeth each for treatment with the different cavity lining materials. Group I teeth were treated with cavity varnish, group II teeth with amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), group III teeth with dentin bonding agent, and group IV teeth with resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC). Electrical resistance and the difference in the <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> of the external surface and the pulp side [A D -A P] of each tooth following heat and cold application for 120 s were measured before and after cavity lining placement to determine the sealing ability and thermal insulating property, respectively. Data collected were subjected to statistical analysis. For paired data, paired t-test and Wilcoxon&#x 2032;s signed rank test were used. One-way ANOVA was used for comparisons between multiple groups and the Mann-Whitney U test for comparisons between pairs. Results: The mean difference in electrical resistance (in K&# 8486;) of different cavity lining materials were as follows: group I = &#x 002 B; 3. 53, group II = &# 8722; 1. 00, group III = &#x 002 B; 20. 43, and group IV = &#x 002 B; 11. 44. The mean differences in the area (A D -A P) under the <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> following heat application were as follows: group I = 6. 6 mm 2, group II = 15. 3 mm 2, group III = 130. 5 mm 2, and group IV = 412. 0 mm 2.

Because thermocouples, pyrometers, or calorimeters are either too expensive or too labor intensive to deploy in many management scenarios or landscape-level research projects, we also compare the time-temperature metrics to a simple field estimate of fuel consumption.

40|$|Fire {{safety of}} {{light gauge steel}} frame (LSF) stud walls is {{important}} in the design of buildings. Currently LSF walls are increasingly used in the building industry, and are usually made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel studs that are fire-protected by two layers of plasterboard on both sides. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under standard fire conditions. However, the standard <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve</b> does not represent the fire load present in typical residential and commercial buildings that include considerable amount of thermoplastic materials. Real building fires are unlikely to follow a standard <b>time-temperature</b> <b>curve.</b> However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls under realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of the traditional LSF wall panels without cavity insulation and the new LSF composite wall panels were developed to simulate their fire performance under recently developed realistic design fire curves. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and literature review. The developed models were then validated by comparing their thermal performance results with available results from realistic design fire tests, and were later used in parametric studies. This paper presents the details of the developed finite element thermal models of load bearing LSF wall panels under realistic design fire time-temperature curves and the re-sults. It shows that finite element thermal models can be used to predict the fire performance of load bearing LSF walls with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards under realistic design fires. Failure times of load bearing LSF walls were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses...|$|E
