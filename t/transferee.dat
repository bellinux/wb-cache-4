25|$|In the {{recording}} system, {{each time a}} land title transaction takes place, the parties record the transfer instrument with a local government recorder located in the jurisdiction (usually the county) where the land lies. The government indexes the instrument by {{the names of the}} grantor (transferor) and the grantee (<b>transferee)</b> and photographs it so any member of the public can find and examine it. If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous grantor could sell the property to another grantee. In many states, the grantee whose transaction is recorded first becomes the legal owner, and any other would-be buyers are left without recourse..|$|E

Edmund Barton and other well-known protectionists lost their seats, Labor was reduced from 30 to 18, and Reid formed his first cabinet. One of his earliest measures was a new lands bill which provided for the division of pastoral leases into two halves, one of which was to be open to the free selector, while the pastoral lessee got some security of tenure for the other half. Classification of crown lands according to their value was provided for, and the free selector, or his <b>transferee,</b> had to reside on the property.|$|E

Under the interim provisions, a firearms dealer who proposes to transfer a handgun must receive from the <b>transferee</b> a statement (the Brady Form), containing the name, address and date of the proposed <b>transferee</b> along with a sworn statement that the <b>transferee</b> is not among any of the classes of prohibited purchasers, verify {{the identity of the}} <b>transferee</b> by examining an identification document, and provide the [...] "chief law enforcement officer" [...] (CLEO) of the transferee's residence with notice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form.|$|E

2500|$|A {{resulting}} trust is usually recognised when {{one person has}} given property to another person without the intention to benefit them. The recipient will be declared by the court to be a [...] "{{resulting trust}}ee" [...] so that the equitable property right returns to the person it came from. For some time, the courts of equity required proof of a positive intention before they would acknowledge the passing of a gift, primarily {{as a way to}} prevent fraud. If one person transferred property to another, unless there was positive evidence that {{it was meant to be}} a gift, it would be presumed that the recipient held the property on trust for the <b>transferee.</b> It was also recognised that if money was transferred as part of the purchase of land or a house, the <b>transferee</b> would acquire an equitable interest in the land under a resulting trust. On the other hand, if evidence clearly showed a gift was intended, then a gift would be acknowledged. In Fowkes v Pascoe, an old lady named Mrs Baker had bought Mr Pascoe some company stocks, because she had become endeared to him and treated him like a grandson. When she died, the executor, Mr Fowkes, argued that Mr Pascoe held the stocks on resulting trust for the estate, but the Court of Appeal said the fact that the lady had put the stocks in Mr Pascoe's name was absolutely conclusive. The presumption of a resulting trust was rebutted.|$|E

2500|$|Following a prank at UVM {{with his}} friend and former bandmate Steve Pollak—also known as [...] "The Dude of Life"—Anastasio {{decided to leave the}} college. With the {{encouragement}} of McConnell (who received $50 for each <b>transferee),</b> Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to Goddard College, a small school in the hills of Plainfield, Vermont. Phish distributed at least six different experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including The White Tape. This first studio recording was circulated in two variations: the first, mixed in a dorm room as late as 1985, received a higher distribution than the second studio remix of the original four tracks, c. 1987. The older version was officially released under the title Phish in August 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{context in}} which the common law left workers {{particularly}} vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another. In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a personal right, and akin to a property right in their jobs. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted, the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the [...] "Acquired Rights Directive"), required that a business <b>transferee</b> would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers' contracts. This means that the new employer who is a <b>transferee</b> of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company's shares: contractual variations require the employees' consent and dismissal rights remain {{as if it were the}} old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in Litster v Forth Dry Dock. The House of Lords held that a purposive interpretation is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would still be there in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law's normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance. The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the <b>transferee</b> employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clause or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases of}} fraud, the same {{principle}} applies; the property is held by the fraudster on constructive trust for the original owner, unless the original owner {{was involved in the}} fraud, as in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 2). An exception to this principle is fraudulent misrepresentation, where the courts disagree over whether it immediately forms a constructive trust or requires action by the victim. In Collings v Lee, an estate agent transferred property to a non-existent purchaser (in reality an alias) and then claimed that as he was not the <b>transferee,</b> {{he did not have to}} pay the vendors; it was held that this fraudulent misrepresentation meant he held the property on constructive trust. However, in Lonrho, Millett J held that [...] "A contract obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation is voidable, not void, even in equity. The representee may elect to avoid it, but until he does so, the representor is not a constructive trustee of the property transferred pursuant to the contact, and no fiduciary relationship exists between him and the representee".|$|E

In legal services and accounting services, the provision that foreign providers have to completely re-do the university degree, practice, and exam in the domestic country is reversed. Further, in telecommunications, courier services, and commercial banking, the government’s control over one major firm in the sector is suspended. Moreover, in computer services and air transport, the limitation on stays for independent services suppliers, for contractual services suppliers, and for intra-corporate <b>transferees</b> is increased from 12  months to more than 36  months. 14 [...]...|$|R

2500|$|Finland {{imposes a}} tax of 1.6% on the {{transfer}} of certain Finnish securities, mainly equities such as bonds, debt securities and derivatives. The tax is charged if the <b>transferee</b> and/or transferor is a Finnish resident or a Finnish branch of certain financial institutions. However, there are several exceptions. E.g. no transfer tax is payable if the equities in question are subject to trading on a qualifying market. Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen (National Coalition Party) decided that Finland will not join a group of eleven other European Union states that have signed up {{to be at the}} forefront of preparing a financial transaction tax in November 2012. Other government parties the Green League, the Social Democratic Party of Finland and the Left Alliance (Finland) had supporters of the tax. Supporters of the tax are Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain and likely Estonia. For example, British banks opposed the tax. Supporters said: [...] "We are delighted that the European FTT is moving from rhetoric to reality and will ensure banks pay for the damage they have caused; This shows it is possible to put the needs of the public over the profits of a privileged few. It's unforgivable in this age of austerity that the UK government is turning down billions in additional revenue to protect the City's elite." ...|$|E
2500|$|An agent {{entrusted}} by {{a principal}} with {{the possession of}} goods is generally recognized as having a sufficient interest in the goods to enable him to maintain an action against a third person for a conversion. [...] Some jurisdictions hold that the agent must {{have more than a}} mere right of possession. [...] A similar result has been reached where the servant left the property in the possession of the defendant, who subsequently converted it. [...] Where a sheriff attached chattels and delivered them for safekeeping to a person, the person was merely the sheriff's servant, and having no interest in the chattels, could not maintain an action for their conversion. Causes of action for conversion are generally assignable, so that the action may be instituted by the assignee. An officer in possession of property may ignore a conversion of the same by a wrongdoer and proceed to sell the property on execution, the purchaser then being permitted to sue the wrongdoer for the conversion of the property. A <b>transferee</b> of personal property, or interest therein, who acquires the right of possession by or through the transfer, may maintain an action for a conversion committed after the transfer, though he has not yet received actual possession of the goods. A creditor, having no interest, generally may not be a plaintiff in an action to retrieve a debtor's converted property. An owner of land may bring an action in conversion, but he must be in material possession of the land and of the property severed from the land {{at the time of the}} conversion.|$|E
2500|$|An acute {{question}} for the TUPE Regulations, particularly in the years when the Conservative government was implementing a policy of shrinking {{the size of the}} public sector, was the extent they applied to jobs being outsourced, typically by a public body, like a local council, or changed between businesses in a competitive tender process for public procurement. On this point a series of ECJ decisions came to the view {{that there could be a}} relevant transfer, covered by the Directive, even where there was no contractual link between a transferor and a <b>transferee</b> business, so long as the business entity retained its [...] "identity". In turn the [...] "identity" [...] of a business would be determined by the degree to which the business' factors of production remained the same before and after a sale. It could be that no employees were hired after an asset sale, but the sacked employees would still have a claim because all their old workplace and capital equipment was being used by the new employer. It is also relevant to what extent a business is capital or labour-intensive. So in Oy Liikenne Ab v Liskojärvi the ECJ held that it was unlikely that 45 Helsinki bus drivers' contracts were transferred, between the company that lost the contract and the new bus company that won it, even though 33 drivers were rehired, because [...] "bus transport cannot be regarded as an activity based essentially on manpower". On the other hand, employees will benefit when a new employer offers old staff their jobs, the intention to rehire makes it more likely the court will deem there to be a transfer.|$|E
