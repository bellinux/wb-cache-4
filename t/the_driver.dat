5|$|At {{the auto}} shop, Shannon offers {{to hide the}} money, but <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> refuses. He hunts down Cook in a strip club, smashes his fingers with a hammer, threatens to kill him, and force-feeds him the bullet {{that was given to}} Benicio. Cook reveals that Nino was behind the robbery. <b>The</b> <b>Driver</b> decides to return the money, but Nino dismisses the offer and instead sends a hit man to the Driver's {{apartment}} building. Entering the elevator with Irene, <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> encounters the hit man. He then kisses Irene, and brutally beats the hit man to death. Afterwards, Irene leaves the elevator stunned and horrified.|$|E

5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>driver’s</b> condition, which {{involves}} staying {{focus on the}} road, {{is the most important}} aspect to consider whenever one is driving. To ignore the importance of this could result in severe physical injuries, deaths and economic losses. Again, previous researches were focused mainly on the physical conditions of the driver; eg movement of head and drowsiness. However, this research is focused on <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> heart rate by using an infrared heart-rate sensor or pulse sensor. These sensors are non-intrusively measured heart pulse wave from <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> heart. By doing experiment, the results show clear pulse wave signal can be obtained by looking at the low to high frequency (LF/HF ratio) which calculate HRV frequency domain of <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> heart rate time series. The LF/HF ratio shows decreasing trends as <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> go from <b>the</b> state of being awake and alert to the state of drowsiness. Therefore, accidents can be avoided if there is an alert system to keep <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> alert and focused on the road...|$|R

Pursued by a mysterious adversary, <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> and Blanche escape after an intense car chase. <b>The</b> <b>Driver</b> hides with Blanche in a motel where he learns from a news report that Standard, according to the pawnshop owner, performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. When she lies about being oblivious to the second car when <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> interrogates her, he slaps Blanche and threatens to hurt her {{to get her to}} talk.

The aim of this study was to establish whether characteristic eye movement patterns precede particular driving manoeuvres. For this purpose, we analysed drivers’ gaze behaviour prior to the execution of different driving manoeuvres performed in real traffic using the DLR ViewCar.

After leaving on Monday, 18 December, she travelled with a family friend employed by a local haulage firm to the French coast, as arranged by her parents, and crossed the Channel the following day, arriving in Ashford, Kent. She intended to travel to Fordingbridge by train; her escort found another French lorry driver, Roger Bouvier, who was willing to take her to Chieveley Services near Newbury, Berkshire. When they arrived, Figard tried to phone Jean-Marc to ask him to pick her up, but misdialed. She was offered a lift to Salisbury by <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of a white Mercedes lorry.
