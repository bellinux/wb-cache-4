5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E

It is uncertain {{when they first}} met, and there are varying accounts of how they came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E

25|$|Watchung, in the 1900s was a semi-rural small {{community}} of about 3,200 people {{in comparison with}} the relatively larger and more urban communities of Plainfield and Somerville. The first mayor of the town was Henry Baldwin Macdonald, who served from 1926 to 1928. Even as late as the 1960s, it was common for residents <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> by name, with few moving in or out of the town. The 1967 Plainfield riots, however, caused an exodus of the large upper-middle class population from the nearby cities to the Watchung Hills area to communities such as Watchung, Warren Township and Bridgewater Township.|$|E

They invited indigenous people from throughout the Americas {{and the rest of}} the world to gather on October 11–14, 2007, near Guaymas, Sonora. The declaration for the conference designated this date because of [...] "515 years since the invasion of ancient Indigenous territories and the onslaught of the war of conquest, spoils and capitalist exploitation".

40|$|For network {{computers}} {{to communicate to}} <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> they need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another’s</b> IP address and MAC address. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is developed to find the Ethernet address that map to a specific IP address. The source computer broadcasts the request for Ethernet address and eventually the target computer replies. The IP to Ethernet address mapping would later be stored in an ARP Cache for some time duration, after which the process is repeated. Since ARP is susceptible to ARP poisoning attacks, we propose to make it unicast, centralized and secure, along with a secure design of DHCP protocol to mitigate MAC spoofing. The secure protocol designs are explained in detail. Lastly we also discuss some performance issues {{to show how the}} proposed protocols work...|$|R

[...] Lim said the show's in-depth discussions made fluency in Korean the number one standard for casting the global guests. Lim said, [...] "The cast of foreign people was because, although Korea is reinforcing its position on the global stage right now, it still is just one country among many others.

500|$|The film (and {{subsequent}} novel) were memoirs {{written by}} Herman Raucher; they detailed {{the events in}} his life {{over the course of}} the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old. Originally, the film was meant to be a tribute to his friend Oscar [...] "Oscy" [...] Seltzer, an Army medic killed in the Korean War. Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had never really had any meaningful conversations or gotten <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> on a more personal level.|$|E
500|$|Anton Yelchin was Doremus's {{first choice}} to play Jacob, based on Yelchin's {{previous}} work, and was cast {{almost immediately after}} meeting Doremus to discuss the role. After auditioning a number of actresses from Los Angeles and London to play Anna, Doremus talked to English actress Felicity Jones over the phone {{and asked her to}} tape rough versions of two scenes from the film. He was so impressed with her rendition of the film's final scene—in which Anna and Jacob stand silently in a shower—that he decided to cast her. After Jones arrived in Los Angeles, she and Yelchin began an intensive week-long rehearsal before filming began. Yelchin and Jones met in a Mexican restaurant to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and, during the week prior to shooting, spent [...] "all day and often all night" [...] discussing Anna and Jacob's relationship with each other and Doremus.|$|E
500|$|On {{an early}} trip the pair took to Austin, Warner and Young met McLoughlin at a {{recording}} session. Warner was producing an album for the recording artist Bill Atkins and found {{they needed a}} fiddle player, {{which led to the}} recruitment of McLoughlin. Initially the immigrants came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> through their mutual love of Monty Python, Benny Hill, and Fawlty Towers. They began to have jam sessions afterwards and there was evident chemistry between the trio, which led to their writing songs together. They named themselves The Greencards in honor of the fact that all three band members carried United States green cards. They eventually began to perform shows locally in Austin to finance the recording of what would become their debut album, 2003's Movin' On. In the process, they {{became one of the most}} popular musical groups in Austin. Representative of an emerging [...] "newgrass" [...] movement, the Greencards' acoustic sound was said to incorporate eclectic influences from Irish traditional, Romani gypsy, and Latin American musical sources.|$|E
