Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>view</b> of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E

Great numbers of financial ratios are based on 'ideal' balance sheet structure. Thus, growing companies with great proportion of unrecorded intellectual capital raises this kind of analysis as doubtful. The aim {{of this article is}} to provide empirical evidence concerning impacts of different ways in recognising and measuring human capital expenditures on financial statements analysis as company's performance measure. Research hypothesis implies that in high-tech industry, financial performance depends on human capital investments, so companies investing in human resources will obtain greater financial results. Consequently, financial statement analysis will provide <b>truer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fairer</b> <b>view</b> of company's performance if human capital expenditures are capitalised in balance sheet rather than recognised as expenses in profit and loss account.

40|$|Indonesia {{has taken}} {{initiatives}} to reform its public sector financial management. One {{of the reform}} agendas was to introduce ‘cash to accrual’ accounting for improved financial reporting. It is expected that improved financial reporting will enhance financial accountabilities of the governmental agencies and will assist {{both internal and external}} decision makers whose decisions will be based on the financial reports. However, it has been observed that there is {{a significant increase in the}} number of qualified audit reports when these financial reports were audited. This also means that these financial reports are lacking in providing <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>views</b> on the financial activities of the governmental agencies, thereby not assisting in discharging their accountabilities. This study seeks to answer the question as to why the numbers of qualified audit reports have increased despite the existence of various governmental accounting reform agendas. Based on the in-depth case studies of three Indonesian local governments, it is found that the demand, the supply and the quality assurance of the accounting information outputs in these local governments are not in parity, and this lacking in parties actually has impacted in producing unqualified and usable accounting reports...|$|R

This paper aims to analyze {{the influence of the}} audit report, prepared for the financial statements of the listed companies, on the investors’ decision in the financial market regarding the stock acquisition or sale. These decisions have an important impact on the stock return, defined through the relative variation of the stock prices from a period to another. In order to reach this goal, the study has been carried out on a sample of 59 companies, listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE), during the 2012 reporting period.

40|$|Revenue is {{the largest}} post in the {{financial}} statements but is often least described. They are an important element when different companies are compared with each other. Revenue {{is often associated with}} assessment which Enron and Prosolvia is two examples of. Enron reported their incomes and assets while their costs and debts were not reported. Thus were a positive image maintained of the company when the financial position in reality were otherwise. Also Prosolvia´s way of reporting revenues were questioned. The part that was mostly questioned was why Prosolvia chose to report revenues while the customer still had the right to return it. Two central questions when it comes to revenue recognition are: When the revenue is recognized? To which value the revenue is being recognized?   To be able to answer these questions the companies use the accounting frameworks, IFRS, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the supplementary normative.   The {{purpose of this study is}} to gain an understanding of how companies report their revenues and which difficulties they encounter and how they solve these. We want to analyze to see if there are any differences or similarities between the companies who reports according to IFRS and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The question we have emanated from is: How do companies report their revenues?   Our study was carried out with a hermeneutical perspective and that is why we used a abductive strategy with a qualitative approach. This strategy suited our study because we wanted to see how the companies report their revenues in reality. The material was collected through open individual interviews and a telephone interview. The choice of companies was made based on which accounting framework they use and what kind of business they have.   The result of our study shows that companies whose business consist of selling goods has a better support from the accounting frameworks in the question when an income becomes revenue. Companies that sell goods must do a deposition to handle the costs concerning the return of goods. When the deposited amount was compared with companies that have service assignments we saw that these companies handle the deposit for warranty likewise. However the companies with service assignments made their assessments more carefully than the companies who sell goods. The companies that had service assignments both used the percentage of completion method, even though they did not work with large projects. The reason was that they thought that this method gives the <b>truest</b> <b>and</b> <b>fairest</b> <b>view</b> of the company. Which value, nominal or fair, the company should report is not clear and simple, no matter which branch they are in. This showed in the interviews where only a few of the companies know what the values meant or what separated them...|$|R

50|$|There are two {{important}} aspects to independence {{which must be}} distinguished from each other: independence in fact (real independence) and independence in appearance (perceived independence). Together, both forms are essential to achieve the goals of independence. Real independence refers to independence of the auditor, also known as independence of mind. More specifically, real independence concerns the state of mind an auditor is in, and how the auditor acts in/deals with a specific situation. An auditor who is independent 'in fact' {{has the ability to}} make independent decisions even if there is a perceived lack of independence present, or if the auditor is placed in a compromising position by company directors. Many difficulties lie in determining whether an auditor is truly independent, since it is impossible to observe and measure a person’s mental attitude and personal integrity. Similarly, an auditor’s objectivity must be beyond question, but how can this be guaranteed and measurntly, but appears independent too. If an auditor is in fact independent, but one or more factors suggest otherwise, this could potentially lead to the public concluding that the audit report does not represent a <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>view.</b> Independence in appearances also reduces the opportunity for an auditor to act otherwise than independently, which subsequently adds credibility to the audit report.|$|E
5000|$|An {{opinion is}} said to be unqualified, or unmodified, when the Auditor concludes that the Financial Statements give a <b>true</b> <b>and</b> <b>fair</b> <b>view</b> in {{accordance}} with the financial reporting framework used for the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements. An Auditor gives a Clean opinion or Unqualified Opinion when he or she does not have any significant reservation in respect of matters contained in the Financial Statements. The most frequent type of report {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Unqualified Opinion", and is regarded by many as the equivalent of a [...] "clean bill of health" [...] to a patient, which has led many to call it the [...] "Clean Opinion", but in reality it is not a clean bill of health, because the Auditor can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the Financial Statements, not the health of the company itself, or the integrity of company records not part of the foundation of the Financial Statements. This type of report is issued by an auditor when the financial statements are free of material misstatements and are presented fairly in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which in other words means that the company's financial condition, position, and operations are fairly presented in the financial statements. It is the best type of report an auditee may receive from an external auditor.|$|E
