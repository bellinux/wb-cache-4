25|$|The {{external}} difficulties had far-reaching consequences. The {{government was}} forced to suspend part of the country's debt payments and eventually to impose exchange controls. Excess coffee production led to increasing interventions in the coffee market. The state programs to support coffee prices went bankrupt in 1930. To avoid further decreases in coffee prices, the central government bought huge amounts of coffee, which was then destroyed. Central government intervention provided support to the coffee sector and, through its linkages, to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, the Mughal Empire declined, as it lost western, central {{and parts of}} south and north India to the Maratha Empire, which {{integrated}} and continued to administer those regions. The decline of the Mughal Empire led to decreased agricultural productivity, which in turn negatively affected the textile industry. The subcontinent's dominant economic power in the post-Mughal era was the Bengal Subah in the east., which continued to maintain thriving textile industries and relatively high real wages. However, the former was devastated by the Maratha invasions of Bengal and then British colonization in the mid-18th century. After the loss at the Third Battle of Panipat, the Maratha Empire disintegrated into several confederate states, and the resulting political instability and armed conflict severely affected economic life in several {{parts of the country}} – although this was mitigated by localised prosperity in the new provincial kingdoms. By the late eighteenth century, the British East India Company had entered the Indian political theatre and established its dominance over other European powers. This marked a determinative shift in India's trade, and a less-powerful impact on <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Since World War II, {{developed}} and {{many developing countries}} have increased {{the participation of the}} age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate, of up to 15 per cent, to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent. In many developed countries, participation in higher education has continued to increase towards universal or, what Trow later called, open access, where over half of the relevant age group participate in higher education. Higher education is important to national economies, both as an industry, in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> [...] College educated workers have commanded a measurable wage premium and are much less likely to become unemployed than less educated workers.|$|E

In July 1970, after the harvest was over, Castro took responsibility for the failure and later that same year he blamed the Sugar Industry Minister saying “Those technocrats, geniuses, super-scientists assured me that they knew what to do in order to produce the ten million tons.

50|$|The new Keynesian {{explanation}} of price stickiness relied on introducing imperfect competition with price (and wage) setting agents.

Huw Dixon and Claus Hansen showed that even if menu costs applied to a small sector of the economy, this would influence <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and lead to prices in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> becoming less responsive to changes in demand.|$|E
