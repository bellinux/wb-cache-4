5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime</b> imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E

He maintained close diplomatic ties with the US {{at a time when the}} Pink tide in Latin America was marked by several regional governments that distanced themselves from the US.

BBC considered that 14ymedio will [...] "contribute with information so that Cubans can decide with more maturity their own destinies", while Vice News described the newspaper as [...] "a new player in town in the homogenous media landscape of the communist island that is already testing the limits of the government’s strict controls on the digital sphere”.|$|R
25|$|In March 1960, Eisenhower {{gave his}} {{approval}} to a CIA plan to arm and train {{a group of}} Cuban refugees to overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime.</b> The invasion (known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion) took place on 14 April 1961. About 1,400 Cuban exiles disembarked at the Bay of Pigs, but failed {{in their attempt to}} overthrow Castro.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{outlined}} {{goals of}} the operations included intelligence collection and the generation of a nucleus for a popular Cuban movement, along with exploiting {{the potential of the}} underworld in Cuban cities and enlisting the cooperation of the Church to bring the women of Cuba into actions that would undermine the Communist control system. The Departments of State, Defense, and Justice were responsible for a combination of these objectives. Kennedy and the rest of SG-A hoped to dispose of <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime</b> and bring change to Cuba's political system.|$|E
25|$|President Kennedy, the Attorney General, CIA Director John McCone, Richard Goodwin, and Brigadier General Lansdale met on November 21, 1961 {{to discuss}} plans for Operation Mongoose. Robert Kennedy {{stressed}} the importance of immediate dynamic action to discredit <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime</b> in Cuba. He remained disappointed from the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion just a few months prior. By the end of November, President Kennedy had finalized details for Operation Mongoose. Lansdale remained in charge of the operation, and access to knowledge of Operation Mongoose remained strictly confidential and limited. As was common throughout the Kennedy presidency, decision making would be centralized and housed within the secret Special Group (SG-A). At this time, Operation Mongoose was underway.|$|E

Emilio and Gloria Estefan issued a joint statement in March 2007, addressing the controversy: ...|$|R
25|$|Operation Mongoose {{consisted}} of a program of covert action, including sabotage, psychological warfare, intelligence collection, {{and the creation of}} an internal revolution against the communist government. The U.S. still lacked the capability of effectively getting information to the majority of the Cuban people. They had a trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port security, and control procedure on transshipment, technical data, and customs inspection. The U.S. also used diplomatic means to frustrate Cuban trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan. From the outset, Lansdale and fellow members of the SG-A identified internal support for an anti-Castro movement {{to be the most important}} aspect of the operation. American organization and support for anti-Castro forces in Cuba was seen as key, which expanded American involvement from what had mostly been economic and military assistance of rebel forces. Therefore, Lansdale hoped to organize an effort within the operation, led by the CIA, to covertly build support for a popular movement within Cuba. This was a major challenge. It was difficult to identify anti-Castro forces within Cuba and there lacked a groundswell of popular support that Cuban insurgents could tap into. Within the first few months, an internal review of Operation Mongoose cited the CIA's limited capabilities to gather hard intelligence and conduct covert operations in Cuba. By January 1962, the CIA had failed to recruit suitable Cuban operatives that could infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime.</b> The CIA and Lansdale estimated that they required 30 Cuban operatives. Lansdale criticized the CIA effort to ramp up their activities to meet Operation Mongoose's expedient timelines. Robert McCone of the CIA complained that Lansdale's timeline was too accelerated and that it would be difficult to achieve the tasks demanded in such a short timeframe.|$|E
25|$|By July, the {{operation}} still showed little progress. Phase I of Operation Mongoose {{drew to a}} close. The Special Group provided plans on March 14, 1962 for {{the first phase of}} {{the operation}} until the end of July 1962. There were four main objectives for Phase 1, a. was to gather hard intelligence on the target area, b. undertake all other political, economic, and covert actions short of creating a revolt in Cuba or the need for U.S. armed intervention, c. be consistent with U.S. overt policy and be in the position to pull away with minimum loss of assets in U.S. prestige, d. Continue JCS planning and essential preliminary actions for a decisive U.S. capability for intervention. During Phase I the Punta del Este conference was a major U.S. political action to isolate Castro and neutralize his influence in the Hemisphere. President Kennedy's successful visit to Mexico was another major U.S. political action with an impact upon the operation but was not directly tied to the operation. Two political operations were performed in Phase I: counter Castro-Communist propaganda exploitation of May Day and to arouse strong Hemisphere reaction to Cuban military suppression of the hunger demonstration at Cardenas in June. Another key interest for Operation Mongoose was the Cuban refugees as it was thought they wanted to overthrow the Communist regime in Havana and recapturing their homeland. The refugees wee given open U.S. assistance to remain in this country yet are involved in covert actions in a limited way. Policy limitations of audibility and visibility were taken into consideration for the handling and use of the refugee potential. As Phase 1 drew to a close Phase II projected plan was written up and considered four possibilities. The first one was to cancel operational plans and treat Cuba as a Bloc nation and protect Hemisphere from it. The next possibility was to exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychological, and other pressures to overthrow the Castro-Communist regime without overt employment of U.S. military. Another possibility was to help the Cubans overthrow the Castro-Communist regime with a step-by-step phase to ensure success including the use of military force if required. The last possibility was to use a provacation and overthrow the Castro-Communist regime by U.S. military force. In his July review, Lansdale recommended a more aggressive plan of action in the near future. He believed that time was of the essence, especially with the intensified Soviet military build-up in Cuba at the time. New plans to recruit more Cubans to infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime,</b> interrupt Cuban radio and television broadcasts, and the deployment of commando sabotage units were drawn up.|$|E

An expert described it as [...] "the only initiative of its time that enlisted citizen participation on a large scale". Fellow dissident Rene Gomez Manzano, on the other hand, was critical of the Project, stating that appeals to the Communist-Party-controlled NAPP were futile; similarly, other Cuban exiles criticized the initiative for what they considered its implicit acceptance of the legitimacy of <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime</b> and its constitution.|$|E

As I have said, the best way to bring change to Cuba is to expose its people to the values, information, and material comforts of the outside world.

Flake joined Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Patrick Leahy on a trip to Cuba to return Alan Gross to the United States. Gross, an American aid worker, had been imprisoned in Cuba for five years, but was released as part of the agreement between Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro. Flake believes that the United States embargo against Cuba is flawed, stating, [...] "The policy that we've had in place for the past 50 years has done more in my view … to keep <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regimes</b> in power than anything we could've done." [...] Flake has traveled to Cuba nine times and supports loosening restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba.|$|R

In {{the late}} 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated that adding {{large amounts of}} manganese sulfate to Everglades muck produced profitable vegetable harvests. Adding [...] of the compound was more cost effective than adding [...] of manure. The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane, though sod, beans, lettuce, celery, and rice are also grown. Sugarcane became more consolidated an industry than did any other crop; in 1940 the coalition of farms was renamed U.S. Sugar and this produced 86percent of Everglades sugar. During the 1930s the sugarcane farmers' coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery. Potential employees—primarily young black men—were lured {{from all over the}} U.S. by the promise of jobs, but they were held financially responsible for training, transportation, room and board and other costs. Quitting while debts were owed was punishable with jail time. By 1942, U.S. Sugar was indicted for peonage in federal court, though the charges were eventually dismissed on a technicality. U.S. Sugar benefited significantly from the U.S. embargo on Cuban goods beginning in the early 1960s. In 1958, before <b>the</b> <b>Castro</b> <b>regime,</b> [...] of sugarcane were harvested in Florida; by the 1964–1965 season, [...] were harvested.
