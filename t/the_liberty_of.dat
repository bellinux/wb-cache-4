5|$|A walled precinct, <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> St Andrew, {{encloses}} {{the twelfth}} century Cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, Vicar's Close and the residences of the clergy who serve the cathedral. Entrances include the Penniless Porch, The Bishop's Eye and Brown's Gatehouse which were all built around 1450.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Madness {{played the}} {{majority}} of their new album <b>The</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> Norton Folgate at London's Hackney Empire for three nights. The Hackney Empire performances were recorded and sold to fans as they left the show on USB wristbands. Madness played two dates in December 2008, firstly in Manchester on 18 December, and secondly a return gig to The O2 in London on the 19th.|$|E
5|$|The new album, {{entitled}} <b>The</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> Norton Folgate, {{was released}} a week later, on 18 May 2009. It charted at No.5 in the UK album charts. The band {{continued to play}} various festivals, including Pinkpop, Splendour, and Glastonbury. On 27 September 2009, the band also played a free concert on a closed-off Regent Street in association with Absolute Radio.|$|E
5|$|Construction began around 1210 by Bishop Jocelin of Wells but principally {{dates from}} 1230. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the cathedral building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin, and {{was responsible for}} building the Bishop's Palace, {{as well as the}} choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel within <b>the</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> the cathedral. He also built a manor house at Wookey, near Wells. The chapel and great hall were built between 1275 and 1292 for Bishop Robert Burnell. The windows had stone tracery. Stone bosses where the supporting ribs meet on the ceiling are covered with representations of oak leaves and the Green Man. The building is seen as a fine example of the Early English architectural style.|$|E

5|$|The Bishop's Palace {{lies within}} <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> St Andrew, which {{encloses}} the cathedral, the Bishop's Palace, Vicar's Close and the residences and {{offices of the}} clergy who serve the cathedral. The palace is accessible from the adjacent market place through an archway known as The Bishop's Eye in the gatehouse to the walled precinct. The Bishop's Eye was built around 1450, by Bishop Beckington. It is a three-storey building of Doulting ashlar stone, with a copper roof and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The Bishop's Eye forms one of a pair with the Penniless Porch which is the gateway into the Cathedral from the market place, which was built {{at the same time}} and in a similar style.|$|E
5|$|The Covent Garden {{estate was}} {{originally}} {{under the control}} of Westminster Abbey and lay in the parish of St Margaret. During a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to St Martin in the Fields, and then in 1645 a new parish was created, splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of St Paul Covent Garden and St Martin, both still within <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> Westminster. St Paul Covent Garden was completely surrounded by the parish of St Martin in the Fields. It was grouped into the Strand District in 1855 when it came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works.|$|E
5|$|The Vicars' Hall was {{completed}} in 1348 and included a communal dining room, administrative offices and treasury of the Vicars Choral. The houses {{on either side of}} the close were built in the 14th and early 15th centuries. Since then alterations have been made including a unified roof, front gardens and raised chimneys. The final part of the construction of the close was during the 1420s when the Vicars' Chapel and Library was constructed on the wall of <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> St Andrew. The south face includes shields commemorating the bishops of the time. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner and the building now used by Wells Cathedral School.|$|E

5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with <b>the</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> their countrymen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women. Other Chinese called them sou-hei (self-combers) for adopting hairstyles of married women. These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E
5|$|The new {{corporation}} {{was required}} to appoint a Watch Committee and a police force under {{the provisions of the}} County and Borough Police Act 1856. In 1947, the City of Peterborough Constabulary amalgamated with <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> Peterborough Constabulary, which had shared its chief constable with Northamptonshire until 1931 and Peterborough thereafter, to form the Peterborough Combined Police force. This, in turn, merged into Mid-Anglia Constabulary in 1965 and was renamed Cambridgeshire Constabulary in 1974. The Fire Brigades Act 1938 made it a requirement for the corporation to maintain a fire brigade; under the Fire Services Act 1947 this function passed to the councils of counties.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} Boston and {{pursuing}} his chosen major, English literature, Marcus began a lifelong hobby of collecting rare and antique books. To finance his pursuits, he began The Book Collector's Service Bureau, a mail-order book service, {{beginning with a}} letter of introduction sent to 100 homes. The venture proved so successful that for a time Marcus considered entering that line of work full time, concerned that entering the retail business might curtail his freedom of expression in politics and other areas of interest; his father persuaded {{him that he would}} always be granted <b>the</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> his own views, and pointed out that retailing was more profitable and thus would allow him to amass a large book collection that much sooner.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any precedent fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if <b>the</b> <b>liberty</b> <b>of</b> a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated. On the facts of the case, the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the precedent fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E
5|$|In 354BC, Demosthenes {{delivered}} his first political oration, On the Navy, {{in which he}} espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) {{as a source of}} funding for the Athenian fleet. In 352BC, he delivered For the Megalopolitans and, in 351BC, On <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> the Rhodians. In both speeches he opposed Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs of}} the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with Megalopolis against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E
5|$|The burgesses, who {{had little}} {{independence}} under the abbey, tried to obtain self-government after {{the dissolution of}} the monasteries. The king ordered Letters Patent to be drawn up granting their requests, but it was not implemented. In 1550 <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> <b>of</b> Whitby Strand, except for Hackness, was granted to the Earl of Warwick who in 1551 conveyed it to Sir John York and his wife Anne who sold the lease to the Cholmleys. In the reign of Elizabeth I, Whitby was a small fishing port. In 1635 the owners of the liberty governed the port and town where 24 burgesses had the privilege of buying and selling goods brought in by sea. Burgage tenure continued until 1837, when by an Act of Parliament, government of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers.|$|E
