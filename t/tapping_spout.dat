5000|$|The furnace {{is built}} on a tilting {{platform}} so that the liquid steel can be poured into another vessel for transport. The operation of tilting the furnace to pour molten steel is called [...] "tapping". Originally, all steelmaking furnaces had a <b>tapping</b> <b>spout</b> closed with refractory that washed out when the furnace was tilted, but often modern furnaces have an eccentric bottom tap-hole (EBT) to reduce inclusion of nitrogen and slag in the liquid steel. These furnaces have a taphole that passes vertically through the hearth and shell, and is set off-centre in the narrow [...] "nose" [...] of the egg-shaped hearth. It is filled with refractory sand, such as olivine, when it is closed off. Modern plants may have two shells with a single set of electrodes that can be transferred between the two; one shell preheats scrap while the other shell is utilised for meltdown. Other DC-based furnaces have a similar arrangement, but have electrodes for each shell and one set of electronics.|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{application}} of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) unit to produce highly oxidizing ozone molecules for the treatment of drinking water. The samples of water were collected from three different sources, namely <b>tap,</b> stone <b>spout</b> and tube-well in the Kathmandu valley. Various physical, chemical and micro-biological analyses were carried out to both the ozone treated and untreated samples of water for comparison. Our results indicated that ozone does not alter the physical characteristics, namely pH, conductivity and turbidity of water but it has significant effect on the chemical properties such as nitrate concentration, total hardness, calcium hardness, Fe(II) and Fe(III) concentration. It was observed that ozone efficiently precipitates ferrous ion into ferric ion and is effective in the removal of fecal coliform, a key element for various water related health problems in most of the developing countries. It is shown that the treatment with ozone leads to a significant {{reduction in the number of}} fecal coliform in the samples of drinking water from <b>tap,</b> stone <b>spout</b> and tube well with p values 0. 00182, 0. 026 and 5. 8 Ã— 10 - 15, respectively at 0. 05 level of significance...|$|R
50|$|They are {{commonly}} installed on rectangular drop-in bathtubs with a shower head combination. In this arrangement, the bathtub is installed tightly against three walls, {{which are often}} covered with ceramic tiles. The bathtub and walls are sealed along the tub and wall abutment with a flexible caulk and rigid grout is used between the tiles to contain all water. The most common North American configuration is a rectangular drop-in bathtub/shower which is 5 foot in length and approximately 32 inch in width, having a shower head, water <b>spout,</b> <b>taps,</b> over flow drain, and bottom drain {{on one of the}} 32 inch ends.|$|R
40|$|An {{observational}} {{study of the}} electric arc furnace (EAF) process for austenitic stainless steel was performed. A comparison was made between two distinct EAF types: (1) an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (EBTF) and (2) a <b>spout</b> <b>tapping</b> furnace (STF). In order to study the slag evolution during the EAF process, per heat several slag samples were collected at consecutive process stages. They were subjected to electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS). Compositional and mineralogical data from 36 heats corroborate that both thermodynamic and kinetic conditions exert a strong influence on the final chromium oxide content of the slag. In the STF, chromium oxide reduction predominantly occurs during tapping, owing to the intimate mixing of steel and slag. A multivariate linear regression analysis reveals that the main parameters determining the overall chromium recovery are the slag basicity {{and the content of}} dissolved silicon of the steel. These parameters explain 70 % of the observed variance in final chromium oxide levels and can be used as control parameters to improve the chromium recovery. For the EBTF, lower chromium recoveries are recorded due to the absence of sufficient mixing during tapping. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{evolution of}} the slag during the electric arc furnace (EAF) austenitic stainless steelmaking was investigated with respect to its effect on chromium recovery and slag foaming. Two distinct EAF types were followed up: (1) an eccentric bottom tapping furnace (EBTF) and (2) a <b>spout</b> <b>tapping</b> furnace (STF). Slag samples were collected from 36 industrial heats at three (EBTF) or five (STF) distinct moments in the process. The microstructure of the slag samples was characterised with electron probe microanalysis using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). From the microstructural analysis it is concluded that at the processing temperature the slag consists of a liquid slag matrix, {{two different types of}} metallic particles and MgO center dot(Al,Cr) (2) O- 3 -based spinel particles. The {{evolution of the}} microstructure is highlighted, the interactions between the phases are discussed and the effects of changing conditions on the slag microstructure are illustrated by thermodynamic calculations. Special attention is given to the effect of slag basicity on the activity of chromium oxide in the slag. It is shown that a thorough study of the microstructural evolution of the slag is instrumental to understanding and improving slag foaming and chromium recovery. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|In 1998 the Pujiang {{became the}} first Shanghai member of the International Youth Hostel Federation. By 1998, [...] "its 80 private rooms cost $40 to $60" [...] per night. Prior to its restoration, the Pujiang Hotel seemed to have reached its nadir, being {{described}} as [...] "an inexpensive, somewhat grotty backpackers' favorite" [...] and [...] "a dive for young budget travelers. Only the ballroom still shows signs of life." [...] A 1999 foreign guest elaborates: [...] "My room {{turned out to be}} located on a floor way up in the Gods that must have been the former servants' quarters. The lift and grand staircase ended at the fifth floor below it and from there you ascended a set of dark, steep stairs to the attic. I imagined the ghosts of weary maid-servants trudging up these stairs late at night.... The polished wooden boards creaked and shook when anyone walked, or thundered, down the passage past my door.... One drawback to living in the attic was that the bathroom I had to use was three flights of stairs down on the third floor. The bathroom, in an annexe {{off the side of the}} building, was a dingy old square room covered all over in white tiles and with drainage holes in the floor that made it look like a gas chamber. The floor sloped away a good four inches as though the annexe was sliding down the outer wall. It felt as though I was still on the ship. Ancient pipes ran down the walls to two antique <b>taps</b> that <b>spouted</b> a solid jet of water which, without the refinement of a shower rose, pelted you from an overhead pipe. A local reporter indicated: [...] "Situated in an inconspicuous corner near the Bund, the Pujiang Hotel, formerly the Astor House Hotel, seems to have lost its bygone glory. The low-rise building has been eroded to be dated in colour, which was submerged among the eminent architecture of the Bund. Few members of the city's younger generation are even aware that the hotel exists, let alone that it is considered the father of the city's luxury hotels.|$|R
