25|$|In 1901 {{principal}} Jones {{persuaded the}} Cardiff Corporation {{to give the}} college a five-acre site in Cathays Park (instead of selling it as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise); and soon after in 1905, work commenced under the architect W. D. Caröe on the new building. Money ran short for this project, however, and although the side-wings were completed in the 1960s the planned Great Hall has never been built. Caroe sought to combine the charm and elegance of his former college (Trinity College, Cambridge) with the picturesque balance {{of many of the}} University of Oxford colleges. On 14 October 1909 the 'New College' building in Cathays Park (now Main Building) was opened in a grand ceremony involving a procession from the 'Old College' buildings on Newport Road.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September 1917, Hutier, {{commanding}} the Eighth Army, ended the two-year siege of the Russian city of Riga. Here, {{he moved his}} troops to an unexpected sector in the Russian lines, and using a heavy bombardment prepared by Georg Bruchmüller and a surprise crossing of the Dvina River, took the city. The tactics he employed—surprise and encirclement—were essentially standard German Army doctrine; indeed, his infantry attacked in company-strength skirmish lines after crossing the River Dvina, much as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in 1914. He followed this success with Operation Albion, an amphibious assault (the only successful one of the war) that seized Russian-held islands in the Baltic Sea. Hutier was awarded the Pour le Mérite by Kaiser Wilhelm II for seizing Riga, and his success there also impressed General Erich Ludendorff, who transferred Hutier to the Western Front in 1918.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, {{beginning}} a {{reform of the}} institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged students to think about military history by asking what <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{in the place of}} the commanders. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, but this is not corroborated by Wilson’s diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.|$|E

500|$|England {{made three}} changes. George Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on his debut, and Len Hutton was {{recalled}} {{to take his}} opening position after being controversially omitted after the Second Test. England's leading batsman, Hutton had scored 74 in the First Test and made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, when none of his teammates passed 26. O'Reilly praised the decision and the England selectors for stopping [...] "all nonsense and phoney tactics". He further speculated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so irrespective of Hutton's form to avoid {{the wrath of the}} parochial Yorkshire spectators at Headingley, but in any case he regarded the original axing as scapegoating for England's two losses. O'Reilly believed the English administrators were penalising Hutton for angering them rather than poor performance. The decision to recall Hutton was met with wide approval from the cricketing public.|$|E
500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was much {{different}} from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported [...] "The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. [...] Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded." [...] The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was no telling what damage <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1953, Chartwell became Churchill's refuge once more when, again in office as Prime Minister, he {{suffered}} a massive stroke. At {{the end of a}} dinner held on 23 June at 10 Downing Street, for the Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi, Churchill collapsed and was barely able either to stand or to speak. On the 25th, he was driven to Chartwell, where his condition deteriorated further. Churchill's doctor Lord Moran stated that, [...] "he did not think the Prime Minister could possibly live over the weekend". That evening Colville summoned Churchill's closest friends in the press, Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Camrose and Brendan Bracken who, walking the lawns at Chartwell, agreed to try to ensure a press blackout to prevent any reporting of Churchill's condition. Colville described the outcome, [...] "They achieved the all but incredible success of gagging Fleet Street, something <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for nobody but Churchill. Not a word of the Prime Minister's stroke was published until he casually mentioned it in the House of Commons a year later". Secluded and protected at Chartwell, Churchill made a remarkable recovery and thoughts of his retirement quickly receded. During his recuperation, Churchill took the opportunity to complete work on Triumph and Tragedy, the sixth and final volume of his war memoirs, which he had been forced to set aside when he returned to Downing Street in 1951.|$|E

Alexander claimed the {{patronage}} of Dionysus and other gods and heroes; he held a banquet at Bactra which combined the toast to his agathos daimon and libations to Dionysus, who was present within Alexander (and therefore the celebrants saluted Alexander rather than the hearth and altar, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for a toast).|$|E
2500|$|Plato's Republic {{notes that}} Greek musicians {{sometimes}} played {{more than one}} note at a time, although this was apparently considered an advanced technique. The Orestes fragment of Euripides seems to clearly call {{for more than one}} note to be sounded at once. Research in the field of music from the ancient Mediterranean—decipherings of cuneiform music script—argue for the sounding of different pitches simultaneously and for the theoretical recognition of a [...] "scale" [...] many centuries before the Greeks learned to write, which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> before they developed their system for notating music and recorded the written evidence for simultaneous tones. All we can say from the available evidence is that, while Greek musicians clearly employed the technique of sounding more than one note at the same time, the most basic, common texture of Greek music was monophonic.|$|E
2500|$|With Tracii Guns {{owning the}} rights to the name (along with Steve Riley), he changed the name of The Tracii Guns Band to L.A.

[...] However, upon returning to Egypt in October 2001, Al-Gamei'a gave an interview to an Islamic website in which he stated, among other things, that Israel was responsible for 9/11 and that [...] "If it became known to the American people, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to the Jews what Hitler did!" [...] and that [...] " [...] are riding {{on the back of the}} world powers." [...] MEMRI's translation of Al-Gamei'a's interview was later cited by The New York Times, which hired two independent translators to confirm the MEMRI translation. Nordlinger wrote that MEMRI's work has [...] "never been found to be anything but honest, accurate, and meticulous" [...] and that because of MEMRI's work: [...] "the sheikh was exposed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Little as he {{was known}} to the white {{inhabitants}} of Lexington, Jackson was revered by many of the African Americans in town, both slaves and free blacks. In 1855, he was instrumental in the organization of Sunday School classes for blacks at the Presbyterian Church. His second wife, Mary Anna Jackson, taught with Jackson, as [...] "he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children, believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the Gospel under the ignorant African race, to lift them up." [...] The pastor, Dr. William Spottswood White, described the relationship between Jackson and his Sunday afternoon students: [...] "In their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully. His discipline was systematic and firm, but very kind. ... His servants reverenced and loved him, as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> a brother or father. ...

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1969–70 season Don Revie completed the signing of Allan Clarke from Leicester City, in the hope of trying to win all three of the major competitions – the League, the FA Cup and the European Cup. In the end, they won none of them – in the League, Leeds were runners up to Everton, and in the European Cup they went out in the semi-finals to Celtic. Leeds also reached the FA Cup final and, despite a memorable performance from Eddie Gray, lost to Chelsea after a replay. Revie's Leeds were victims of their own success; FA rules at the time stipulated that a squad of only 20 players could be used, and as a consequence some of the Leeds players took part in 62 competitive games that season. Additionally, FA rules only allowed the use of one substitute, and even then only in case of injury. Other factors, such as fixture congestion and the FA's insistence that Leeds play 9 games in 22 days (the 1969–70 season was foreshortened by England's early departure to Mexico to defend the World Cup) meant that Revie was often forced to field tired players. Geoffrey Green of the Times wrote: [...] "It has been a strenuous slog, greatly pressurised by the loss of a month because of the demands of Mexican acclimatisation for England's players in the World Cup. None have suffered more than Leeds United's players ... At {{the beginning}} of March, Leeds looked capable of winning everything and anything, including the General Election. At that time they seemed unbeatable, but in the end a condensed programme of highly competitive fixtures overwhelmed them. Should it be any consolation to them, Leeds have now probably won something more in defeat as good losers than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in many hours of victorious celebrating – universal public sympathy." ...|$|E
