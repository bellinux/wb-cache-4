40|$|In {{an effort}} to extend {{experimentally}} determined data {{on the characteristics of}} very low-frequency radio waves, a vlf transmitting station (8. 4 kc) was established at Shaver Lake, California. The establishment of this station permitted controlled experiments in long distance propagation, ionospheric vertical sounding measurements, and attempts at the generation of round trip gyroelectric-echoes. The long distance measurements indicated that at vlf, the ground or surface wave radiated by the antenna, can be detected at great distances. The ionospheric vertical incidence measurements showed rapid fading of the received signal around local sunrise and sunset. Propagation {{in the presence of the}} ionosphere is considered in the theoretical form of propagation in a homogeneous gyroelectric medium. The results of this analysis are tabulated in graphical form so that the dispersive qualities of the medium can be readily examined. With the aid of these results, an examination of the natural phenomena of whistlers is presented in order to determine the feasibility of generating gyroelectric-echoes. Reflection and transmission coefficients are presented for vertical incidence in order to ascertain the order of magnitude of such an echo.

NARS sites were configured for 10 kW output, {{with the exception of}} site 41 in both directions and site 42's connection to site 41. Each set consisted of two transmitters and four receivers, for redundancy and to boost signal to noise ratios, using vacuum tube technology which proved time consuming to maintain at high levels of efficiency.Levels of service proved extremely variable with the effects of weather and finicky equipment frequently causing loss of connection. Improvements were gained through improved maintenance procedures but did not change significantly until the introduction of solid state technology, with the system able to transmit at 9.6kbit/s, (a very fast internet connection for that time), by the time the system was closed down in 1992 after 30 years of service.With the advent of satellite communications the days of the Troposcatter networks were over, but NARS was closed down early due to the loss of the DYE-2 DEW Line station in 1988, severing the networks connection {{with the rest of the}} DEW line.

40|$|International audienceCoda Wave Interferometry (CWI), {{a method}} to {{evaluate}} subtle changes of elastic wave velocity in a medium, has been proven to be effective to detect small changes or ultrasonic velocity in concrete caused by load, temperature, moisture, damage or other means. While classical CWI is just able to determine velocity changes globally in relatively large areas between and around pairs of transmitters and receivers, several approaches have been proposed to identify the area affected by the changes more precisely. Most of them {{are based on the}} calculation of sensitivity kernels for de-correlation of signals measured at a specific state against a reference. Others follow simplified approaches. In a laboratory setup a concrete specimen of 1. 5 by 1. 5 by 0. 5 m m³ was compressed at a certain point by a thread rod, screw nuts and 10 by 10 cm m³ load distribution plates including a load cell to measure the effective load. Maximum loads of 20 to 100 kN (more than one orders of magnitude below the compressive strength of the concrete) have been applied in 5 to 10 kN steps in various cycles. The specimen is equipped with 18 embedded ultrasonic broadband piezo transceivers (60 kHz central frequency). Ten of these receivers have been connected to a multiplexer and ultrasonic <b>transmitting</b> and <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment</b> in a way that allowed almost continuous two way measurements between all sensor pairs. Some of the sensors have been just a few cm away {{from the center of the}} load, some almost 1 m. Even simple ways to evaluate the data (e. g. crosscorrelation between signals at different load states) allowed pinpointing the load center at least approximately. A more detailed data evaluation either using CWI or even more one of the more sophisticated localization algorithms gave Òsharperî results in terms of localization and a better correlation between load and velocity change/de-correlation. Referencing the results to the transmitter-receiver pair least affected by load change has led to further improvement.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} propagation measurements results using Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) {{to investigate}} the characteristics of 6 MHz wideband Digital Terrestrial Television channel at 677 MHz for fixed and portable reception. Empirical measurements were done at predetermined measurement points consisting of 21 radials {{for a total of}} 92 locations extending to 20 kilometers around the National Broadcasting Network (NBN) digital transmitter. Characterizations were conducted using antenna heights of 9 m (fixed reception), 3 m (fixed reception), and 1. 5 m (portable reception). Modulation Error Rate (MER), power received, field strength and delay profiles were captured to help characterize the channel in an urban area in and around Metro Manila at day time for temperatures ranging from 26 ◦C to 32 ◦C. Measured field strength was compared to NTC F(50, 90) curves. Polynomial fit using least square errors was used to plot the field strength coverage of NBN. For large-scale fading, it is observed that signal power conforms to Log Normal distribution. The study helped identify problem sites within the coverage. These are locations within the coverage area or at the outskirts of the coverage area where DTV signal is not received at all. A more accurate description of the DTT channel will lead to a better design of the parts of the Digital Television system from the network to <b>transmitting</b> system and <b>receiving</b> <b>equipment.</b> Path loss exponents computed for the three antenna heights can be helpful in developing empirical prediction models...|$|R
