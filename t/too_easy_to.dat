5|$|The {{practice}} of coon hunting is sometimes associated with possum hunting, since the same dogs were often used, {{the animals are}} both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.|$|E
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E

25|$|The {{aforementioned}} submarines were {{an attempt}} to gain an edge over the Greek navy (which had only one Nordenfelt submarine, a smaller and older version). However, it was quickly realized that – like the other Nordenfelt submarines ordered by Russia – they suffered from stability problems and were <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> swamp on the surface.

25|$|Gerry Anderson {{began his}} career in photography, earning a {{traineeship}} with the British Colonial Film Unit after the war. He developed an interest in film editing {{and moved on to}} Gainsborough Pictures, where he gained further experience. In 1947 he was conscripted for national service with the Royal Air Force. He was based at RAF Manston, an airfield near Margate, and served part of his time in air traffic control. On one occasion, a Spitfire was coming in to land. It was only about 50 feet above the ground before the runway controller alerted the pilot to the fact the plane's undercarriage hadn't lowered. The pilot opened up the throttle and climbed away. As this was a moment Anderson always remembered, he found it all <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> write about aircraft when he devised stories for Thunderbirds. After completing his military service, he returned to Gainsborough, where he worked until the studio was closed in 1950. He then worked freelance on a series of feature films.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal is to get the highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E

25|$|If so, {{then we must}} plan our eugenic policy {{along some}} such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, {{allegedly}} less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> access <b>to</b> relief or hospital treatment lest {{the removal of the}} last check on natural selection should make it <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> for children <b>to</b> be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.|$|R

Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society, [...] "the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> believe that evolution has culminated in one's own views".

Others said Dreyer's lyrics and vocals still overshadow the instrumentation. Alex Andrews of Thrash Hits gave the album a four out of six rating, saying: [...] "The flipside of Dreyer's imposing presence is that it can be all <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> let the rest of the band fade into the background.

Judy Daniel from Sinclair User called the gameplay [...] "dodgy" [...] and thought it was not one of Singleton's best games. A reviewer for Computer Gamer was more negative towards the game. While saying that the game had interesting ideas in it, they did not think that the ideas worked together.

500|$|Many reviewers criticised the {{repetition}} of the game's levels. Francesco Serino (Eurogamer) criticised the variation between levels and said it wasn't too long before he was seeing similar levels because of the game's simplicity. He said that the levels are usually well made but are too often made for certain characters, which adds more gameplay {{because of the time}} it takes to discover the best strategies to complete a level. Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb) liked the overall gameplay of Monaco but disliked some of the later levels as they turned into [...] "tedious exercises in trial-and-error". Ben Allan (Gameplanet) said the single-player mode was less fun due to there being fewer variations and less chaos. Anton Bjurvald said that he fell in love with the simplicity of the graphics and liked the majority of the gameplay but said that it seemed like the game's artificial intelligence was made <b>too</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> be fooled.|$|E

After finding the non-player character, the game [...] "picked up again and kept me hopping for the rest of it." [...] Didi Cardoso of website Grrl Gamer also enjoyed the freedom, but noted that sometimes she felt lost and was unsure of how to find the location of the next recipe. The chocolate manufacturing mini-game was also praised as [...] "fun". Peter Cohen of Macworld noted that some fans of business simulators might find the mini-game [...] "off-putting", but also suggested that it helped break up gameplay.
