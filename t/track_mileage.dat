5|$|As {{noted by}} a {{historical}} marker {{on the large}} hill in Central Campus, the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. The surrender of the city {{took place on the}} southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864. The next twenty years were a time of rapid industrial expansion; during this period, Georgia's manufacturing capital, railroad <b>track</b> <b>mileage,</b> and property values would each increase by a factor of three to four.|$|E
25|$|The only urban light rail/subway system {{operating}} in Missouri is MetroLink, which connects {{the city of}} St. Louis with suburbs in Illinois and St. Louis County. It {{is one of the}} largest systems (by <b>track</b> <b>mileage)</b> in the United States. The KC Streetcar in downtown Kansas City opened in May 2016.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the railroad network had over-expanded with many miles of unprofitable routes. In 1906 Congress gave the Interstate Commerce Commission the power to regulate freight rates and the industry was unable to increase revenue enough to cover rising costs. By 1916, the peak year of <b>track</b> <b>mileage,</b> one-sixth of the nations railroad trackage was in bankruptcy.|$|E
5000|$|HyperTrack is a {{location}} platform offering developer tools for large and independent mobile application companies.

50|$|MileIQ is an American-based {{technology}} company that develops a <b>mileage</b> <b>tracking</b> and logging app. The app uses automatic <b>mileage</b> <b>tracking</b> to calculate <b>mileage</b> while driving for business purposes that {{can then be}} used to report for reimbursement and potentially a tax deduction with the IRS, being attributed as the first mobile app to passively track such data. MileIQ {{has been compared to}} Fitbit for driving and has been discussed in national business publications that include Fast Company, Fortune, and Forbes.|$|R
5000|$|MileIQ {{was founded}} by Dan Bomze, an {{entrepreneur}} and investor of numerous startups. He began collaborating with a small team to design software that would simplify mileage reimbursement. Bomze obtained feedback from others who <b>tracked</b> <b>mileage</b> for reimbursement and began looking for a business partner knowledgeable with software development. He was introduced to SlideRocket CEO and former Salesforce.com general manager Chuck Dietrich who became a founding partner in the company. MileIQ was officially launched in the App Store in 2013, later becoming available for Android.|$|R

2500|$|The term {{ruling grade}} is usually {{used as a}} synonym for [...] "steepest climb" [...] between two points on a railroad. More simply, the steepest grade to be climbed {{dictates}} how powerful the locomotive must be (or how light the train) in order to complete the run without assistance. Even if 99% of the line could be run with a light (and cheap) locomotive, if at some point on the line there is a steeper gradient that a light engine {{would be unable to}} climb, this gradient [...] "rules" [...] that a more powerful (and expensive) locomotive must be used, in spite of it being far too powerful {{for the rest of the}} line. This is why special [...] "helper engines" [...] (also dubbed [...] "Bankers") are often stationed near steep grades on otherwise mild tracks, because it is cheaper than running a too-powerful locomotive over the entire <b>track</b> <b>mileage</b> just in order to make the grade, especially when multiple trains run over the line each day.|$|E

30|$|EX {{also liked}} to track {{physical}} activities (40 %) such as running speed and duration and monitoring muscle changes while working out. The other dimension EX wanted to track was consumption habits (20 %) {{such as how}} much they spend in a year. These kinds of functions {{can be incorporated into}} apps for existing wearables instead of developing devices solely for tracking consumption habits. For example, the Billings Pro app for the Apple watch can <b>track</b> time, <b>mileage,</b> and expenses (Fearn 2016). Both NC and EX also considered physical activities to be important self-defining qualities, and many existing wearables track physical activities. Designers could develop wearable trackers that can track moods and feelings for NC and physical activities for both NC and EX. However, none discussed tracking their immediate surroundings and the environment in which they were located through practices such as recording photos or videos as reviewed in the literature.|$|R

50|$|The 31 mile {{portion of}} the main line from Huntingdon to Hopewell, via Saxton and Riddlesburg, was {{completed}} in 1855. On February 3, 1859, the Bedford Railroad Company was chartered to provide a railroad connection for Bedford, and was incorporated February 19, 1859. This company, with financial assistance from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), built a line from Mount Dallas to Hopewell in July 1863, connecting with the H&BTM. It was merged into the H&BTM on August 17, 1864. Total <b>track</b> <b>mileage</b> at the company's height was just over 72 miles.|$|E
5000|$|Manchester Metrolink is Greater Manchester's urban transit system. The {{network in}} 2008 had 3 routes, 37 {{stations}} and 23 mi of track. [...] The Phase 3a extension already had funding, with surveys and inspection work already underway. [...] Further extensions proposed under the TiF scheme would have increased <b>track</b> <b>mileage</b> to 67 mi, {{the number of}} stops to 108, the combined impact of the recently announced extensions to the Metrolink network (which {{are not part of}} TiF) and the impact of TiF extensions would bring to the total passenger capacity to 70 million journeys annually (from 20 million in 2008).|$|E
50|$|Though United tracked {{customers}} {{as far back}} as the 1950s, the very first modern frequent-flyer program was created in 1972 by Western Direct Marketing, for United Airlines. It gave plaques and promotional materials to members. In 1979, Texas International Airlines created the first frequent-flyer program that used <b>mileage</b> <b>tracking</b> to give 'rewards' to its passengers, while in 1980 Western Airlines created its Travel Bank, which ultimately became part of Delta Air Lines' program upon their merger in 1987. American Airlines' AAdvantage program launched in 1981 as a modification of a never-realized concept from 1979 that would have given special fares to frequent customers. It was quickly followed later that year by programs from United Airlines (Mileage Plus) and Delta Air Lines (SkyMiles), and in 1982 from British Airways (Executive Club).|$|R
5000|$|One of Toronto council's staunchest conservatives, he {{is noted}} for his fiscal {{conservatism}} and tendency to oppose public spending measures. For example, in 2008 Holyday proposed that taxpayers' {{money could be}} saved if Toronto city councillors reduced their office expenses, kept better <b>track</b> of business <b>mileage,</b> adopted more frugal newsletters, stopped donating to community groups and sports teams in their wards, and had to justify restaurant meals. [...] In addition to his fiscal conservatism, Holyday has also supported conservative policies in other fields. For example, he opposed banning gun clubs in Toronto, {{as well as a}} decision by council to ban the Toronto Sportsmen’s Show from the CNE (council later reversed its decision). He has proposed removing the homeless from Nathan Phillips Square, and was the only member of council not to vote for a resolution describing homelessness as a national disaster. He once criticized plans to close certain streets in downtown Toronto for a [...] "car-free day", saying that that would {{have a negative impact on}} businesses. Holyday also supported reducing the number of councillors, and voted against childcare subsidies. He also voted against holding an inquiry into the MFP computer leasing scandal. In 2012, Holyday proposed that casino lobbyists be banned from city hall, stating [...] "I think the fairest way to do it is to take that part out of the equation".|$|R
50|$|During the 25 {{years that}} {{followed}} the American Civil War, railway <b>track</b> <b>mileage</b> in the United States more than doubled, {{changing the face of}} America forever. Rail transportation meant that products made in the East could be shipped West for far less than previously. This allowed for an economy of scale - larger, more efficient factories. The agricultural heartland of America was no longer confined to a market of single day's trip by wagon. Railroad and railroad construction became one of the largest industries during that era. By 1881 one out of 32 people in the United States was either employed by a railroad or engaged in railroad construction.|$|E
