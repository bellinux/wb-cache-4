40|$|Ply-tear webbing is {{essentially}} two plain webbings that are bound {{together by a}} portion of the warps and that can be torn apart and do work by breaking the binders. Nylon webbing were woven to range in <b>tear</b> <b>force</b> from 1 to 10 kilonewtons. This force is substantially independent of speed, which was as high as 100 m/sec in some cases. A specific energy absorption of 90 J/g was achieved in the dry state. However, lower rated webbings that absorb approximately 40 J/g are recommended for use in practice where it is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|T he {{development}} of Medium density fiberboard (MDF) made from renewable biomass of pineapple (Ananas comosus) leaf fiber and their suitability as a construction material has been investigated. Two {{different types of}} board with a target density of 0. 8 gr/cm 3 were manufactured. The board was prepared in three layers of about 1 : 1 : 1 weight ratio in unidirectional and cross-oriented board using low molecular weight (LM) PF resin type PL- 3725 and high molecular weight (HM) PF resin type PL- 2818 for impregnation and adhesive purposes. For comparison, boards with the same structure were prepared using high molecular weight PF resin only. The mechanical properties of the boards have been examined {{as well as their}} physical properties. The results shows that generally, mechanical properties, Modulus Of Elasticity (MOE), value was improved with mix PF resin as well as Modulus Of Rupture (MOR). Pineaplle leaf fiber resulted in significantly higher MOR, consistent with our observation during the test. This information is useful when a high MOR is required in application. Other mechanical properties such as internal bonding (IB) and screw-holding capacities (SH) improved as those of MOE and MOR. Fiber from agricultural residues such as pineapple leaf are longer than wood fiber. This might explain why screw-holding capacities increased since the failure in those tests is mainly due to <b>tear</b> <b>force.</b> Diffrences in the physical properties between the board types were caused by the presence of the low molecular weight PF resin for the impregnation of the fibers. As using of mix PF resin, thickness swelling (TS) properties improved as well. No significant difference was found for both mechanical and physical properties. The effect of the PF resin for impregnation was noted; however, fiber orientation had no effect on both physical and mechanical properties of the specimens. </p...|$|E
40|$|Subject of Research. We present {{findings}} of the optical contact for details made of СО- 115 Мglass-ceramics brand mark. The optical contact is the main method of joining parts made of CO- 115 M glass-ceramics brand mark in commercially available laser gyros. The existing technology {{has a number of}} unresolved issues related to the durability of the optical contact, that determine the tightness of the laser sensor internal volume. Method. Mechanical strength control of the optical contact consisted in the measurement of specific <b>tear</b> <b>force</b> of the connection. Mechanical strength tests of the optical contact were carried out with the use of RMI- 250 tensile testing machine. The evenly increasing load of 50 N/s was applied to the samples in mechanical tests. The value with the occurence of the optical contact destruction was registered. Main Results. We have shown that one of the main factors determining the mechanical strength of the joint is cleanliness of the surfaces being connected. Comparison of the influence of different surface cleaning methods for optical elements on the optical contact durability has been given. The negative impact of even short-term storage of optical parts after washing on the assembly strength has been shown. The additional operation of mechanical polishing of surfaces of stored optical parts before connection enabled significantly reducing the scatter of the optical contact mechanical strength. We have also established experimentally that the heating of assembly of optical elements under vacuum at a temperature of 300 °C leads to the twofold increase in the optical contact strength, while the optical contact remains separable. Practical Relevance. The carried out studies make it possible to improve the technical and operational characteristics of the laser gyroes. The use of additional mechanical cleaning of surfaces of optical parts and vacuum heating of the assembly in the process of laser sensor production may significantly improve the reliability, integrity, period of storage and operation...|$|E

40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi avaliar a técnica de curtimento bioleather e o curtimentocom sais de cromo, em peles de carpa espelho (Cyprinus carpio specularis). As peles foram retiradas com o auxílio de uma máquina, identificadas e congeladas. Em seguida, foram curtidas por meio de duas técnicas diferentes. O passo seguinte foi retirada dos corpos de prova, que foram levados para o laboratório, climatizado em torno de 23 º C e umidade relativa, do ar de 50 %, {{conforme}} NBR 10455 (1988), por 24 horas. Para os testes de resistência à tração, ao alongamento e à determinação da força de rasgamento progressivo, utilizou-se o dinamômetro EMIC. Foram retiradas amostras da região dorsal do couro para análise de microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV). As amostras foram secas em ponto crítico com CO 2 e metalizadas com íons de ouro-paládio. Em seguida as amostras foram elétron-micrografados com o JEOL-JSM 5410. Observou-se o entrelaçamento e sobreposição das camadas das fibras colágenas, que proporcionam maior resistência ao couro, constatada pelos testes realizados. Os couros curtidos com a técnica bioleather apresentaram maiores valores no teste de tração (20, 45 N/mm 2) em comparação ao cromo (12, 32 N/mm 2). Não houve diferença na elongação entre os tratamentos (bioleather = 72, 52 %; cromo = 84, 74 %). Para o teste de rasgamento progressivo, o curtimento ao cromo foi superior (26, 28 N/mm), comparado ao bioleather (11, 96 N/mm). Entretanto, os dois curtimentos podem ser utilizados nas peles dessa espécie de peixe para a confecção de vestuários. The {{objective of}} the work was to evaluate the tanning technique to bioleather and with chromium salts, in carp mirror skins (Cyprinus carpio specularis). The skins wore removed {{by means of a}} machine, identified and congealed. Next they were tanned by the two techniques. The test bodies wore removed and taken to the laboratory climatized around 23 º C and relative humidity of the 50 % air, as ABNT- NBR 10455 (1988), for 24 hours. For the tests of tensile strenght and to the elongation and the determination of the gradual <b>tear</b> <b>force</b> dynamometer, EMIC was used. Samples of the dorsal region of the skin for analysis of scanning electron microscopy wore removed (MEV). The samples wore drought in critical point with metallized CO 2 and with íons of gold-palladium. Specimens were then electron-micrographed with JEOL-JSM 5410. One observed the interlacement and the overlapping of the layers of the collagens staple fibers that provide greater resistance to the leather, and this resistance can be evidenced by the tests. The pieces of leather tanned with the bioleather technique presented higher values in the test of traction (20. 45 N/mm 2) in comparison to chromium (12. 32 N/mm 2). There was no difference in the elongation between the treatments (bioleather = 72. 52 %; chromium = 84. 74 %). For the test of gradual tearing, tanning to chromium was superior (26. 28 N/mm) compared with bioleather (11. 96 N/mm). Even though, the two tanning techniques can be used for skins of this species of fish for clothes confectio...|$|E
