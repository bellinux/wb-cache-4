5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held at}} Roma's home ground <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the match as favourites, despite Liverpool's {{previous}} record in the competition. Watched by a crowd of 69,693, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the first half when Phil Neal scored, but Roma equalised before half-time through Roberto Pruzzo. With the scores level at 1–1 through full-time and extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2 to claim their fourth European Cup.|$|E
5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, thanks to a superior goal difference, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the game as underdogs due {{to a number of}} their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or suspension, and because they had lost to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw they needed to go to the next stage of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|E

5|$|New York's success {{continued}} in the 1960s. They finished 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle and head coach Allie Sherman, the Giants won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961–1963. In 1961, they were beaten 37–0 by the Packers. In 1962, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the championship game with a league-best 12–2 record and a nine–game winning streak, but they lost to the Packers again, 16–7.|$|E

Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|Bolton {{struggled}} {{in the following}} two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock as they destroyed Leicester 5–0 at Filbert Street to go top of the table. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since {{the formation of the}} Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at Old Trafford, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> a deep slump {{during the middle of the}} season and needed a Fredi Bobic hat-trick against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against Leeds United at Elland Road. Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.|$|E

5|$|Tailapa II, a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi– 1000 (Bijapur district) overthrew KarkaII, re-established the Chalukya rule in {{the western}} Deccan and {{recovered}} most of the Chalukya empire. The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the Cholas, and with their cousins, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. VikramadityaVI is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty. Starting {{from the very beginning}} of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original Saka era and established the Vikrama Era. Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in this new era. VikramadityaVI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan. The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of Kannada literature and Sanskrit literature. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the Hoysala Empire, the Pandyas, the Kakatiya and the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} bought by John Batchelor in March 2002, but the {{following}} December <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> administration. In March 2003, York were {{taken over by the}} Supporters' Trust, and were relegated to the Conference National in 2003–04, ending 75 years of Football League membership. The team were unsuccessful in the play-offs in the 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons, and were beaten at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium in the 2009 FA Trophy Final. In 2011–12, York defeated Newport County at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 FA Trophy Final, and shortly after returned to the Football League with a 2–1 win over Luton Town in the play-off final. In their second season in League Two, the club reached the play-offs but were knocked out in the semi-final by Fleetwood Town. After four years back in the Football League, York were relegated to the National League in 2015–16. They were relegated to the National League North the following season, but won the FA Trophy after beating Macclesfield Town in the 2017 final.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} battle for Gaza in April 1917, Kress von Kressensteincommander of the victorious 3rd, 16th and 53rd Divisionswas {{reinforced}} by the 7th and 54th Divisions. The 7th Infantry Division (later part of the Eighth Army) had experienced four months of strategic movement, {{similar to that of}} the 54th Division. Having arrived at Jerusalem, in early May the 20th Infantry Regiment began company-level training. After moving to Beersheba where they remained in reserve, they participated in theatre-specific training until late June, when <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the front line. Training in fortification, reconnaissance, and counter–reconnaissance continued. The 21st Infantry Regiment received similar training, and on 6 August the regimental colours of the 20th and 21st Infantry Regiments were awarded military medals for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. At Beersheba on 28 June, the 7th Infantry Division inactivated the fourth company of each infantry battalion, before activating a machine gun company armed with light machine guns, in every infantry battalion on 10 August. Every Ottoman infantry division in Palestine repeated this reorganisation, with one quarter of their rifle strength being replaced by light machine guns, considerably increasing their fire power and strengthening their offensive and defensive capabilities. Following orders from von Kressenstein commanding the Gaza to Beersheba line defences, assault detachments equivalent to the German Stosstruppen (Stormtroopers) were formed. The 7th Division activated an assault detachment of fifty men on 17 July 1917.|$|E

5|$|Denis Troch {{was hired}} as the club's new manager in August 2008, and despite hopes of a swift return to Ligue 2, the team {{performed}} poorly throughout the 2008–09 campaign. The side failed to win a league match {{during the first three}} months of the season, and that form continued into 2009. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> their final match of the season, away at Pacy Vallée-d'Eure, requiring three points to avoid successive relegations. However, the side could only procure a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championnat de France amateur for the first time since 1970. The relegation saw the end of Chamois Niortais's era as a professional club, as they were forced to become a semi-professional outfit due to the DNCG rules. In June 2009, Pascal Gastien was appointed as manager for his third spell in charge of the club, handed the task of achieving promotion back to the Championnat National at the first attempt. The club won the CFA Group C that season, and was subsequently promoted back to the National division for the following campaign. Niort secured their third-tier status with an 11th-place finish in the 2010–11 season. The following season, the team finished as runners-up in the Championnat National behind Nîmes Olympique to return to Ligue 2 for the 2012–13 campaign and regain their professional status.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{enjoyed a}} run of success {{over the next several}} years. Led by league MVP quarterback Charlie Conerly, who passed for 1,706yards, 14 touchdowns, and four interceptions, they {{finished}} 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Conerly struggled with age and injuries in 1960, and was replaced by George Shaw. Gifford was concussed in a vicious hit by Chuck Bednarik during a November game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the rest of the season, and the following season, as a result. The hit was so devastating, that after being taken to the locker room, Gifford was given his last rites. The team still finished with a winning record at 6–4–2, but were led to acquire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Y. A. Tittle in the offseason. Led by Tittle and new head coach Allie Sherman, New York won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961 to 1963. In 1961, they were beaten by the Packers, 37–0 in the championship game. In 1962, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the championship game with a 12–2 record, and a nine-game winning streak; but lost to the Packers again, 16–7. Nonetheless, the Giants had captivated New York by this time, even though the sold out game was played in single-digit weather with 35mph winds, only 299 of the 65,000+ fans who bought tickets stayed home. Before the 1962 season, Gifford came out of his injury-forced retirement, saying he missed the game too much. He changed positions from halfback to flanker. During the season, Tittle and wide receiver Del Shofner set still-standing team records when Tittle threw for seven touchdowns and Shofner amassed 269 receiving yards in the same game on October 28. After the season, the team traded two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Roosevelt Grier to the Los Angeles Rams at his request; Grier wanted to move to LA to start his singing career.|$|E
