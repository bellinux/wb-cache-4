5|$|Munir Sheikh, Canada's Chief Statistician {{appointed}} on Harper's advice, resigned on July 21, 2010, {{in protest}} of the government's change in policy. Ivan Fellegi, the former Chief Statistician of Canada, criticized the government's decision, saying <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are least likely {{to respond to a}} voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.|$|E
25|$|A Catechumen (from Latin catechumenus, Greek κατηχουμενος , instructed) is one {{receiving}} {{instruction in}} {{the principles of the}} Christian religion with a view to baptism. It is for this reason <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> already validly baptized in another Christian Faith are not known as Catechumens, but rather Candidates.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} novelty in these ideas, which are largely {{lifted from the}} {{theories}} of language and speech of the French Philosophes of the 18th century. They also follow on from ideas expressed in Wagner's earlier essay The Artwork of the Future, to the effect <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> outside the Volk (community) are inimical to true Art.|$|E

25|$|Rastas do {{not believe}} that there is a {{specific}} afterlife to which human individuals go following bodily death. They believe in the possibility of eternal life, and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die. One Rasta view is <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> righteous are believed to go through a process of reincarnation, with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.|$|E
25|$|Constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos has {{questioned}} {{the notion that}} the legalisation of same-sex marriage in South Africa represents the pinnacle of the human rights struggle of members of the LGBT community. He argues <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not involved in long term monogamous relationships and those who cannot {{come out of the closet}} and get married because of the threat of victimisation may not see any benefit from the legislation.|$|E
25|$|Health Canada has {{investigated}} {{the risks and}} benefits of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine/ephedra. Near the end of the study, Health Canada issued a warning on their website stating <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> under the age of 12, or who have heart disease and may suffer from strokes, should avoid taking pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. Also, they warned that everyone should avoid taking ephedrine or pseudoephrine with other stimulants like caffeine. They also banned all products that contain both ephedrine (or pseudoephedrine) and caffeine.|$|E

25|$|Under the JG, {{people of}} working age {{who are not}} in {{full-time}} education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and underemployment with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a reasonable living rather than suffer the indignity and insecurity of underemployment, poverty, and social exclusion.|$|E
25|$|Intense {{psychological}} stress caused by unwanted, troublesome memories can cause brain {{structures such as}} the amygdala, hippocampus and frontal cortex to become activated, as they process the memory. Related to this, there is some neuroimaging (fMRI) evidence <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to PTSD have a hippocampus with a reduced size. Research has also demonstrated the adrenal activity from intense stress dramatically increases activity in the amygdala and leads to changes in brain functioning as well as altering physiological indicators of stress; heart rate, blood pressure {{and an increase in}} salivary enzymes, all of which vary with individual responses to stress.|$|E
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, {{or social}} immunity) {{is a form}} of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune. In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not immune will come into contact with an infectious individual.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} how to {{overcome}} these obstacles and encourage greater voter participation among low income and homeless citizens {{was done by the}} National Coalition for the Homeless and other national advocacy and grassroots social movement groups. These groups collaborated to create a manual that promotes voting access for low income and homeless persons to ensure <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> economically disadvantaged maintain an active role and voice in shaping their futures. The manual is designed to provide ideas to help overcome the many obstacles that prevent people experiencing homelessness from becoming registered, active voters. By working together with homeless persons, low-income individuals, and advocates around the country, grassroots social movement organizations can work alongside homeless and low-income persons to make their voices heard on Election Day.|$|E
25|$|People who are {{homeless}} {{tend to be}} socially isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health. Studies have correlated <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> homeless and have a strong support group {{tend to be more}} physically and mentally healthy. Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to social isolation is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of shame of revealing their current homeless state. Social isolation ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking with those who are not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{socioeconomic}} status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, social capital plays {{a significant role}} in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives. The segregation of communities on the basis of income occurs in nations worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of health as a result of a decrease in social capital for those trapped in poor neighborhoods. Social interventions, which seek to improve healthcare by enhancing the social resources of a community, are therefore an effective component of campaigns to improve a community's health. A 1998 epidemiological study showed that community healthcare approaches fared far better than individual approaches in the prevention of heart disease mortality.|$|E

25|$|The {{identity}} of ethnic Serbs was historically {{largely based on}} Orthodox Christianity and on the Serbian Church in particular, {{to the extent of}} the claims <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not its faithful are not Serbs. The conversion of the South Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the Great Schism, the split between the Greek East and the Catholic West. After the Schism, those who lived under the Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic. Some ethnologists consider that the distinct Serb and Croat identities relate to religion rather than ethnicity. With the arrival of the Ottoman Empire, some Serbs converted to Islam. This was particularly, but not wholly, the case in Bosnia. Since {{the second half of the}} 19th century, some Serbs converted to Protestantism, while historically some Serbs were Catholics (especially in Dalmatia; e.g. Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik). The remainder of Serbs remain predominantly Serbian Orthodox Christians.|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{commented that}} the album is not as {{appealing}} to audiences who are unfamiliar with the band. Saul Austerlitz from The Boston Globe wrote that the album was [...] "intended to cater primarily to rabid fans", commenting <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not fans of Slipknot will probably [...] "find the experience of listening to both discs of 9.0: Live roughly comparable to being {{hit in the head}} repeatedly with a two-by-four two hours of sludgy, indistinguishable songs, punctuated by profane outbursts about how the idiot media [...] has ignored and abused them".|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer Schilling {{called the}} self-referential {{nature of the}} release a [...] "very postmodern conceit", which he thought worked well despite the dual faux pas of parodying The Matrix and overtly [...] "satirizing game mechanics". He felt that the satire was not good, though the writing was [...] "genuinely funny", and that the {{repeated}} Dominatrix fight scenes should not have felt as low budget. He recommended the pack for those who love [...] "wry gags about creaky gaming tropes with the occasional belly laugh", {{and said he had}} a better time finding his own fun than playing through the missions. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E

500|$|University of Florida {{historian}} David Colburn stated, [...] "There is {{a pattern}} of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place, and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don't {{want to talk about}} it, they don't want to identify anyone involved, and there's also a tendency to say <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> involved were from elsewhere." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2013 the White House {{published}} {{a response to}} a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools. The response is titled [...] "there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language" [...] and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively. Scholars such as Beth S. Benedict advocate not only for bilingualism (using ASL and English training) but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf. [...] York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, in the Great Catechism, Gregory {{suggests}} that while every human will be resurrected, salvation {{will only be}} accorded to the baptised, although he also states that others driven by their passions can be saved after being purified by fire. While he believes {{that there will be}} no more evil in the hereafter, it is arguable that this does not preclude a belief that God might justly damn sinners for eternity. Thus, the main difference between Gregory's conception of ἀποκατάστασις and that of Origen would be that Gregory believes that mankind will be collectively returned to sinlessness, whereas Origen believes that personal salvation will be universal. This interpretation of Gregory has been criticized recently, however. Indeed, this interpretation is explicitly contradicted in the [...] "Great Catechism" [...] itself, for at the end of chapter XXXV Gregory declares that those who have not been purified by water through baptism will be purified by fire in the end, so that [...] "their nature may be restored pure again to God". Furthermore, in the next chapter (ch. XXXVI), Gregory says <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> purified from evil will be admitted into the [...] "heavenly company".|$|E
2500|$|Irving Kristol {{posits that}} one reason <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> [...] "experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the imitatio Christi, would lean toward {{socialism}} ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. [...] " ...|$|E
