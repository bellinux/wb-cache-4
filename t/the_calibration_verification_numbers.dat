40|$|ABSTRACT. USEPA’s water program {{staff and}} their {{counterparts}} in state pollution control agencies increasingly emphasize watershed and water quality−based assessment and integrated analysis of point and nonpoint sources of pollution. BASINS 3. 0 (Better Assessment Science Integrating point and Nonpoint Sources) is a system developed {{to meet the needs}} of such agencies. This study was conducted to evaluate the major watershed−scale models, SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program − Fortran), included within the BASINS 3. 0 system. SWAT and HSPF were calibrated and verified with data from the Upper North Bosque River watershed (UNBRW), an intense dairy producing region located in central Texas. The model output was calibrated for daily flow, sediment, and nutrients measured at five stream sites within the UNBRW for the period of January 1994 through June 1995 and verified (daily and monthly time−step) for the period of July 1995 to July 1999. Nash−Sutcliffe model efficiency (E) and mean error (ME) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The average daily flow, sediment, and nutrient loading simulated by SWAT were closer to measured values than HSPF during both <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification</b> periods at the outlet of UNBRW. As indicated by E values, the temporal variations of daily flow (E = 0. 72 and 0. 70 for HSPF, while E = 0. 17 and 0. 62 for SWAT during <b>the</b> <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification,</b> respectively) and sediment (E = 0. 11 and 0. 23 for HSPF, while E = − 2. 50 and − 3. 51 for SWAT during <b>the</b> <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification,</b> respectively) were better described by HSPF during <b>the</b> <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification</b> periods.

This point reveals the necessity of the control, improvement and solving the problems of rivers, especially all problems relating to water quality. In this study, transport of the suspended sediment is numerically modeled.

The first group of bridges having river beds formed by fine material (i. e., silt and clay), the second group of bridges having river beds formed by sand material, and finally, bridges having river beds formed by gravel or cobble materials.

Results show that for wide piers, computed scour depth is more than the measured depth. In gravel bed streams, the computed scour depth is also greater than measured scour depth, the reason is due to the formation of the armor layer on the bed of the channel.

40|$|The {{terrestrial}} runoff {{component is}} a comparatively small but sensitive and thus significant quantity {{in the global}} energy and water cycle at the interface between landmass and atmosphere. As opposed to soil moisture and evapotranspiration which critically determine water vapour fluxes and thus water and energy transport, it can be measured as an integrated quantity over a large area, i. e. the river basin. This peculiarity makes terrestrial runoff ideally suited for <b>the</b> <b>calibration,</b> <b>verification</b> and validation of general circulation models (GCMs). Gauging stations are not homogeneously distributed in space. Moreover, time series are not necessarily continuously measured nor do they in general have overlapping time periods. To overcome this problems with regard to regular grid spacing used in GCMs, different methods {{can be applied to}} transform irregular data to regular so called gridded runoff fields. The present work aims to directly compute the gridded components of the monthly water balance (including gridded runoff fields) for Europe by application of the well-established raster-based macro-scale water balance model WABIMON used at the Federal Institute of Hydrology, Germany. Model calibration and validation is performed by separated examination of 29 representative European catchments. Results indicate a general applicability of the model delivering reliable overall patterns and integrated quantities on a monthly basis. For time steps less then too weeks further research and structural improvements of the model are suggested. (orig.)
