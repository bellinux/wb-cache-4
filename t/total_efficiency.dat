Fast-food restaurants, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward <b>total</b> <b>efficiency</b> since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals {{and the addition of}} drive-through windows.|$|E
25|$|Although icebreaking {{cargo ships}} {{had been built}} in the past, their hull forms were always compromises between open water {{performance}} and icebreaking capability. A good icebreaking bow, designed to break the ice by bending it under the ship's weight, has very poor open water characteristics and is subjected to slamming in heavy weather. However, a hydrodynamically efficient bulbous bow greatly increases the ice resistance, making it unsuitable for icebreakers. As a result, the <b>total</b> <b>efficiency</b> of icebreaking ships is 20–40% less than that of good open water vessels of similar size mainly due to the bow form.|$|E
25|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{efficiency of}} any type of power generation system is never reached in practice, {{and it does not}} consider other steps in power generation, such as production, transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming no heat recapture) According to the World Energy Council, this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high-temperature fuel cells (solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell's operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase <b>total</b> <b>efficiency</b> to as much as 80%.|$|E

40|$|The Floating Cup Displacement {{principle}} {{is a relatively}} new axial piston displacement principle for hydrostatic pumps, motors and transformers. Since its origin in 2001, it has been mainly applied in fixed displacement pump prototypes. At the SICFP’ 05, a design for a variable displacement open circuit Floating Cup Pump was presented. Now, the first prototype of a 28 cm 3 unit based on this design, has been built. This papers reports the first efficiency measurements of this prototype. So far, the unit has been tested at 100 % and 50 % swash angle. The <b>total</b> <b>efficiencies</b> at these swash angles are already quite good, even if no design loops have been made yet. The paper further describes a new method to separate the losses in this unit over the different loss mechanisms. This method is used to distill the mechanical torque losses from the measurements.
