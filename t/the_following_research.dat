The industry trend in portable devices has piggybacked {{on the success}} of wireless technology but not {{on the success of}} other disciplines, such as dynamical system, Cybernetics and adaptive systems, for root-cause solutions to close the [...] "true" [...] loop. While the slow-responding dynamics in the physiology of glucose regulation is not beyond the mathematics of PID controllers, 50 years of patient-perspective [...] "advancement" [...] says it is beyond the corporate, congressional, and lobbying leaders. Also, the accuracy of existing continuous glucose monitoring systems poses a problem for an artificial pancreas.|$|E

In particular, clinical and translational research are important for both entities to advance the quality of patient care. UC San Diego Health conducts several hundred clinical studies per year at its hospitals and clinics. In 2016, the university opened the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI) building, which brings together professors in medicine, chemistry, neuroscience, molecular biology, mechanical engineering, political science, bioengineering, computer science, and pharmacy to solve new and complex medical questions. The ACTRI also enables collaboration with the Jacobs School of Engineering, the Salk Institute, the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, the J. Craig Venter Institute, and San Diego State University. Its building is connected by a footbridge to Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center and the Jacobs Medical Center complex.
