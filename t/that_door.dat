Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using <b>that</b> <b>door.</b> The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E

25|$|Doors {{are often}} symbolically endowed with ritualistic purposes. For example, being granted {{access to a}} door, {{including}} the guarding or receiving of the key to <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> may have special significance. Similarly, doors and doorways frequently appear in literature and the arts in metaphorical or allegorical context, often as a portent of change.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{the great}} hall, Guthere is {{planning}} to launch the first attack. Garulf counsels him not to do so, saying that Guthere's life is too valuable. Guthere proceeds anyway, and asks who holds <b>that</b> <b>door.</b> Sigeferth replies to Guthere's taunt from within, showing that the attack is being mounted at Door A. Sigeferth {{is said to be}} a lord of the Secgena; in Widsith a Sæferð or Sasferth is said to be lord of the Sycges or Secgan, apparently referring to the same character. The two sides fight at <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> and Garulf, the counsellor, and many of the attackers die. It is not clear what happens to Guthere whom he counselled. Garulf the counsellor is said to be Guthlaf's son; it is not clear whether or not this is the same Guthlaf who holds the door as a defender at Door B.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to activation sensors automatically opening doors are generally fitted with safety sensors. These are usually an infrared curtain or beam, {{but can be}} a pressure mat fitted on the swing side of the door. The purpose of the safety sensor is to prevent the door from colliding with an object in its path by stopping or slowing its motion.A mechanism is set in modern automatic doors to ensure <b>that</b> <b>door</b> will be in open state in case of power failure.|$|E

50|$|Reception for fairy doors {{have been}} mixed, as proponents claim <b>that</b> the <b>doors</b> are {{entertaining}} and can stimulate the imagination while critics claim <b>that</b> the <b>doors</b> can cause {{damage to property}} or surrounding flora and fauna. Residents {{in the small town}} of Crewkerne, Somerset complained over a series of 200 fairy <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> had been installed in the nearby Wayford Woods as the village's infrastructure was not equipped to deal with the amount of tourism <b>that</b> the <b>doors</b> attracted. The townspeople also complained of increased garbage along the wood's trails, leading to the woodland's trustees removing the fairy doors.|$|R

The crush developing from these cross-currents soon bought the pace on the dress circle stairs to a halt, inducing a frenzied panic when people further up pressed downward, unaware of the jam below.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating <b>that</b> <b>door</b> as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E

[...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through <b>that</b> <b>door,</b> she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E

Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes, but that there are currently no plans for such a return: [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>door</b> [...] will always be open, just because it's such a nice party to go to.

40|$|Data for the {{probability}} <b>that</b> a <b>doors</b> are open or {{closed in the}} event of a fire is sparse. The literature only presents a snap-shot rather than how the position of the door has changed over time. This paper describes the development of a low-cost, unobtrusive logging device that can continuously monitor the position of a door for extended periods. The devices were used to record 180 days of data from 52 doors located in different types of sleeping occupancies: hotels, apartments, dormitories and rest homes. Results were obtained for {{the probability}} <b>that</b> <b>doors</b> were open during day-time and night-time; and also during weekdays and weekends. Overall a probability distribution for the fraction of time <b>that</b> a <b>door</b> was found to be open is an inverse Gaussian function with mean µ = 0. 104 and shape factor l = 0. 0117...|$|R

500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, who obviously knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out <b>that</b> <b>door</b> so quick we didn't hear it shut.

The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the session was marred by conflict and drama. After the band had completed the song's instrumental backing track, guitarist and harmony vocalist David Crosby announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day. The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's manager, record producer Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him [...] "The only way you're {{going to get through}} <b>that</b> <b>door</b> is over my dead body...You're going to stay in this room until you do the vocal." [...] According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results. Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer [...] "got it all out and sang like an angel." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of <b>that</b> <b>door.</b> For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E
