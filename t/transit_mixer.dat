5000|$|Stephen Stepanian (February 28, 1882 - October 1964) (Armenian: Ստիվեն Ստեփանեան) was an Armenian American {{inventor}} {{and owner}} of numerous patents including the Elevator and Conveyor, Compound Tool, and the Wrench. He is also accredited as the inventor of a self-discharging motorized <b>transit</b> <b>mixer</b> that was the predecessor of the concrete mixer truck. Stepanian is often called the [...] "father of the ready-mix concrete industry." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{high range}} water reducer in bridge floors was {{initiated}} by an Iowa Highway Research Board project (HR- 192) in 1977 for two basic reasons. One {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using a high range water reducer (HRWR) in bridge floor concrete using conventional concrete proportioning, transporting and finishing equipment. The second was to determine the performance and protective qualities against chloride intrusion of a dense concrete bridge floor by de-icing agents used on Iowa's highways during winter months. This project was basically intended to overcome some problems that developed in the original research project. The problems alluded to are the time limits from batching to finishing; use of a different type of finishing machine; need for supplemental vibration {{on the surface of the}} concrete during the screeding operation and difficulty of texturing. The use of a double oscillating screed finishing machine worked well and supplemental vibration on one of the screeds was not needed. The limit of 45 minutes from batching the concrete to placement on the deck was verified. This is a maximum when the HRWR is introduced at the batch plant. The problem of texturing was not solved completely but is similar to our problems on the dense "Iowa System" overlay used on bridge deck repair projects. This project reinforced some earlier doubts about using truck <b>transit</b> <b>mixers</b> for mixing and transporting concrete containing HRWR when introduced at the batch plant...|$|R
5000|$|Special {{concrete}} transport trucks (in - <b>transit</b> <b>mixers)</b> {{are made}} to transport and mix concrete up to the construction site. They can be charged with dry materials and water, with the mixing occurring during transport. They can also be loaded from a [...] "central mix" [...] plant, with this process the material has already been mixed prior to loading. The concrete mixing transport truck maintains the material's liquid state through agitation, or turning of the drum, until delivery. The interior of the drum on a concrete mixing truck is fitted with a spiral blade. In one rotational direction, the concrete is pushed deeper into the drum. This is the direction the drum is rotated while the concrete is being transported to the building site. This is known as [...] "charging" [...] the mixer. When the drum rotates in the other direction, the Archimedes' screw-type arrangement [...] "discharges", or forces the concrete out of the drum. From there it may go onto chutes to guide the viscous concrete directly to the job site. If the truck cannot {{get close enough to}} the site to use the chutes, the concrete may be discharged into a concrete pump, connected to a flexible hose, or onto a conveyor belt which can be extended some distance (typically ten or more metres). A pump provides the means to move the material to precise locations, multi-floor buildings, and other distance prohibitive locations. Buckets suspended from cranes are also used to place the concrete.The drum is traditionally made of steel but on some newer trucks as a weight reduction measure, fibreglass has been used.|$|R

50|$|In the 1920s, Kristian Hindhede {{pioneered the}} use of ready-mix {{concrete}} trucks with a horizontal rotating drum mixer. He is described as the inventor of this vehicle in the Danish Who's Who Kraks Blå Bog. As early as 1916, Stephen Stepanian of Columbus, Ohio, developed a self-discharging motorized <b>transit</b> <b>mixer</b> that was the predecessor of the modern ready-mix concrete truck, but the patent that Stepanian filed in 1916 was rejected in 1919. The poor quality of motor trucks {{at the time was}} a problem for inventors.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, Jeff Wilson had left Graniterock and Anna Wilson had retired. Her daughter, Mary Elizabeth Wilson Woolpert, {{took over as}} president. Again, {{it was a time}} for growth. Wet {{processing}} and loading plants were built at Aromas, and new plants were acquired at Salinas, Felton, Santa Cruz and Los Gatos. The Company purchased its first fleet of <b>transit</b> <b>mixer</b> trucks from Ford Motor Company in Salinas. With two young children at home, Betsy Woolpert turned the Company presidency over to her husband, Bruce G. Woolpert.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen {{invented a}} self-discharging {{motorized}} <b>transit</b> <b>mixer</b> {{that was the}} predecessor of the concrete mixer truck and applied for a patent in 1916. However, the patent was rejected in April 1917 by the patent office because {{it was believed that}} a truck could not support the weight of a concrete mixer on top of it. The patent office also noted that there was no previous patenting information that proves integration was possible with both the mixer and the design of the truck. Other sources suggest that the patent was rejected because Stepanian was not an American citizen. [...] However, on December 21, 1928, Stepanian reapplied for the patent and received approval on November 21, 1933.|$|E
40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation Materials Laboratory {{personnel}} {{announced in}} early 1982 {{a process to}} produce a road deicer consisting of sand grains coated with calcium magnesium acetate (CMA). From that point forward the Iowa DOT began searching for a means of economically producing CMA to their concept. During 1983 and 1984 the first attempts devised for commercially producing CMA were attempted by the W. G. Block Company, Davenport, Iowa, under Iowa Highway Research Board Project HR- 253. This first attempt at commercially producing CMA was accomplished {{by the use of}} concrete <b>transit</b> <b>mixer</b> equipment. Even though this procedure proved successful in the batch mixing of CMA, the need for higher production rates to reduce the cost per ton still existed. During the fall of 1984, Cedarapids Inc, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, proposed to Iowa DOT personnel the application of their technology to a continuous mixing concept for CMA. Arrangements were made for the continuous test mixing of 60 to 100 tons of CMA/sand deicer. This report covers the production effort, description and results of procedures outlined in Cedarapids Inc's proposal of September 19, 1984. The objectives of this research were: 1. To produce the CMA/sand deicer concept on a continuous mixing basis to Iowa DOT CMA concentration levels. 2. To evaluate the results of preheating the carrying vehicle (sand) prior to CMA ingredient introduction. 3. To analyze the feasibility of production equipment and procedures necessary for portable and/or stationary applications of continuous mixing concepts...|$|E
