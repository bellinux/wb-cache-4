The governing equations for the fluid flow are the Navier-Stokes equations of incompressible Newtonian fluid. The interface between water and air phases is captured by a VOF (volume of fluid) method. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is treated with moving meshes in the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian frame. The present numerical model is validated against wave generation and propagation over a flat bed and the decay of a free rolling rectangular barge in still water. The comparisons with available numerical {{results show that the}} present numerical wave flume works well. It is then used to investigate the roll response of the twin floating barges in proximity. The numerical results of this work show that the resonant frequency of the fluid oscillation in the narrow gap between twin rolling barges is smaller than that between twin fixed barges. However, the resonant wave height in the gap between twin rolling barges is observed {{to be in the same}} magnitude as that between twin fixed barges. Moreover, the present numerical results indicate that the maximum rolling amplitudes of the <b>twin</b> <b>barges</b> are close to each other, and they appear at the same resonant frequency of the fluid oscillation in the narrow gap. At the low frequency band, the amplitude of the rear barge is larger than that of the leading one. Otherwise, in the frequency band higher than the resonant conditions, the leading barge has a larger response. The present numerical solutions also suggest that the <b>twin</b> <b>barges</b> roll in anti-phase...|$|E
40|$|In {{the coming}} decades, the {{offshore}} decommissioning industry {{is becoming a}} quickly growing market, especially at the North Sea, where most offshore platforms have operated {{for more than twenty}} years. There is little room for the mistake in the offshore decommissioning operation, therefore the motion response analysis is essential to avoid the risks. It is common practice to use frequency domain analysis to simulate the dynamic behavior of floating structures in waves for linear system. However, offshore operations generally involve various nonlinearities such as nonlinear mooring system, wave-induced impacts during lift-off operation, and viscous forces. The frequency domain analysis is not capable of dealing with these nonlinearities, so the time domain analysis is pursued in this study. The Cummins equation provides an attractive way of analyzing the dynamics response of offshore structures in time domain, in which a convolution term is introduced to describe the uid memory effect. Neither the frequency domain analysis, nor the time domain convolution integral is convenient for time domain simulation. To facilitate the efficiency of time domain simulation, a state space model is introduced to replace the convolution term leading to a constant parameter time domain model. At the same time, the physical properties of the convolution term can be enforced into the state space model using convex optimization. The proposed time domain approach has been validated by comparing with the frequency domain analysis results for a linear system in the regular and irregular wave conditions. The topside removal concept proposed by Mammoet consists of a <b>twin</b> <b>barges,</b> in order to eliminate the problem caused by the moment-induced by the topside, as well as wave-induced motion, two linkages are incorporated into this concept. The time domain analysis proves that the purpose of these linkages are achieved that the relative sway and roll are successfully restricted. Finally, different load transfer stages are studied to obtain the dynamic response and its interaction forces between the topside and barges.

40|$|The {{decommissioning}} market expenditure {{is expected}} to grow further {{in the years to come}} due to increasing number of platforms that near the end of their production cycle, mainly being xed steel structures (< 4, 000 [Te]) positioned in shallow waters (30 to 75 [m]). The risks of such operation emerged the need for semi-submersible, heavy-lift vessel or ultimately catamaran vessel design (i. e Pioneering Spirit), all being expensive concepts with high lifting capacities making a single-lift option possible, also ensuring robust operating windows; however, these designs are tailored to be project-speci c and technically redundant. Such way of thinking do not comply with the lean, modular and reusable engineering philosophy Mammoet Global Engineering is introducing via its novel conceptual design counterproposal, under the name Mammoet O shore Platform (MOP); a <b>twin</b> <b>barge</b> concept with proper mechanical couplings would create a modular and thus resusable, less stiff configuration that achieves operational robustness in irregular seas. The technical challenge identi ed is the asymmetric barge roll motion due to the eccentric topside weight and the respective roll hydrodynamic loading. Roll motion in beam waves (900 angle of attack) {{is expected to}} be the dominant design parameter and is addressed via the implementation of a kinematic constraint so that barges and topside roll (f) is synchronized. Furthermore, the barges are modeled to heave and pitch independently, therefore significant differential motions in the corresponding DOF (bank : & flip :) are anticipated and need to be treated; the use of a passive link, modeled as a spring-dashpot, has qualified while its structural parameters will be optimized with the H 1 technique. The research question in hand comprises of MOP concept technical feasibility study which will be quantitatively assessed via the following Key Performance Indices (KPI) : Steady-state dynamic behavior of MOP (constrained barges) against two free oating barges and a catamaran barge of identical geometry speci cations, working entirely in the frequency domain (modeling in linear potential solver Wamit) Steady-state dynamic behavior of MOP (constrained barges & link optimized in H 1) against the model identified in the previous analysis (state-space modeling and control in Matlab) The frequency domain simulations for the case studies tabulate that the roll kinematic constraint has successfully attenuated & shifted the peak response while the link structural properties optimization has minimized the differential barge motions in heave and pitch ensuring wider operational windows and verifying this work ow as a proof of concept.

40|$|Immersed tunnel {{elements}} are prefabricated {{in the construction}} yard and then transported to the construction site to {{be integrated into the}} tunnel. During the transportation and immersion, the floating tunnel element is connected via cables to the immersion barges/pontoons. In this study, the hydrodynamical behavior of a floating tunnel element during construction has been modeled. The motional characteristics and stability of a floating tunnel element and <b>twin</b> <b>barges</b> during the installation are investigated. This study aimed to investigate, how the stability of the system can be improved to make it possible to immerse a large number of tunnel elements in relatively short span of time in offshore conditions. The hydrodynamical behavior of the system and the related forces in different construction stages are analyzed. The focus of the study was on the determination of the influence of the pontoon configuration on the systems stability, the related forces, and operability. For this study, Fehmrnbelt Fixed Link tunnel project has been taken as a case study. The calculations are performed for two different pontoon configurations, namely: - Catamaran (conventionally applied pontoon for the immersion of tunnel elements) - Semi-submersible (platform used in offshore industry) In the analysis, first, the main dimensions of the two pontoons are determined. The pontoons form the main piece of the immersion equipment. Subsequently, during the transport, the forces and moments on the floating element are evaluated. Two main type hydraulic external forces have been taken into consideration in the model, namely current and wave force. For different positions along transport route, the forces and moments are calculated for finite water depth and different values of flow velocity. From the analysis, it appears that the wave-induced motions of a floating tunnel element are negligible. The relatively small waves are not able to bring the massive tunnel element into motions. The lowest natural periods of the floating tunnel element appears for roll degree of freedom, and it is about 8 s. The significant current forces and moments occur during the fitting out. The stability of a floating element during transport is primary determined by the towing velocity. During immersion, the systems stability due to waves and current forces is being analyzed. To assess the stability of the system for different current conditions, the vortex shedding periods are calculated. Then the natural frequencies of the system have been evaluated for different pontoon configurations and tunnel element length. It appears that an immersion system with Catamaran pontoons seems to be less sensitive to vortex shedding period in contrast to the Semi-submersible barge. A Semi-submersible barge can only be used in 80 % of current conditions in Fehmarnbelt. A Catamaran pontoon can be applied in 95 % of the occurring current conditions. Also, during the immersion, the wave-induced motions of the tunnel element can be ignored, provided that the wavelengths and wave periods are not too large. On the other hand, the relatively light pontoons are sensitive to wave loadings. The motions of the barges are prevented by the element, which leads to significant force fluctuations in suspension cables. In the analysis, the coupling between surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw degrees of freedom are considered. The calculations are performed for the first order responses that are valid in relatively low wave heights. Hydrodynamic effects caused by the nonlinearities are disregarded in the calculations. The pontoons were considered as a hybrid structure. That means, concerning the horizontal degrees of freedom the pontoon structure is regarded as it is compliant and it behaves like a floating structure. While concerning the vertical degrees of freedom, it is stiff and resembles as a fixed structure, and it is not allowed to float freely. The contribution of the mooring lines to the first order response is considered of minor importance, and it is disregarded. Numerical studies are conducted to compare the dynamical behavior of the Catamaran pontoon with that of the Semi-submersible. The results of this study reveal that:  - The contribution of the first order wave force to the pontoons motions in soft degrees (surge, sway, and yaw) is limited - The motions in stiff degrees of freedom (heave, pitch, and roll) are normative for the immersion operation. When the tunnel element is immersed in wave conditions T> 5 s and H > 1 m, then there is a significant danger that one of the suspension cables will break when applying a Catamaran pontoon. If a Semi-submersible barge is used, then the tunnel element can be immersed in wave conditions T < 6. 5 s and H < 1. 8 m. - Semi-submersible pontoon has larger natural frequencies than Catamaran pontoon. The natural periods of the Semi-submersible barge are approximately a factor 1. 4 larger than the natural periods of the Catamaran pontoon. - A Semi-submersible pontoon is more sensitive to the force fluctuation in the suspension cables than the Catamaran pontoon concerning the static stability and floating capacity. Especially the floating capacity became problematic if the force fluctuations become large and therefore the pontoon can be pulled under water. - The heave motions mainly affect the force fluctuations in suspension cables, and they can be considered as normative. - Both barges are sensitive to the increasing wave height and period. However, the effect on Catamaran pontoon is larger. In total, a Semi-submersible barge has favorable operability in the waves and current conditions in Fehmarnbelt. Therefore, if the workability is the primary objective, then it is better to apply a Semi-submersible pontoon. Then in 77 % of environmental conditions, the tunnel elements can be immersed.
