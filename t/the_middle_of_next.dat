25|$|In 1842, Berlioz {{embarked}} on a concert tour of Brussels, Belgium from September to October. In December he began a tour in Germany which continued until <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> year. Towns visited included Berlin, Hanover, Leipzig, Stuttgart, Weimar, Hechingen, Darmstadt, Dresden, Brunswick, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Mannheim. In Leipzig he met Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann, the latter of whom had written an enthusiastic article on the Symphonie fantastique. He also met Heinrich Marschner in Hanover, Wagner in Dresden and Giacomo Meyerbeer in Berlin. Back in Paris, Berlioz began to compose the concert overture Le carnaval romain, based on music from Benvenuto Cellini. The work was finished the following year and was premiered shortly after. Nowadays it {{is among the most}} popular of his overtures.|$|E

It's very heavy, very {{aggressive}} and very dark. There are elements of Dead Son Rising in that, but it's much further along that particular road." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith did {{fiercely}} oppose [...] "the hellish {{policy of}} reprisals" [...] in Ireland, impressing the young Oswald Mosley. J.M. Hogge even urged Sir Donald Maclean (31 August) to [...] "knock Asquith into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> week" [...] and seize back {{the chairmanship of}} the Liberal MPs. Late in 1921 the National Liberal Federation adopted an industrial programme without Asquith's agreement. On 24 October 1921 Asquith commented [...] "if one tries to strike a bold true note half one's friends shiver and cower, and implore one not to get in front of the band".|$|E

2500|$|... "When {{speaking}} about the LP, it's perhaps more correct to talk about 'state of mind'. These recordings are the product, or rather {{the preservation of the}} feelings and mental state of mind of the band for the last few months. And what months! We've verified that asceticism does indeed enrich the spirit, and the spirit is being recorded on a steel-thread which in turn will be put into vinyl which will be released as Þeyr's second LP in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> month, God and a certain somebody in that company willing.” (Þeyr in an interview with Þjóðviljinn on October 11, 1981).|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, {{there is quite a}} bit of roiling darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and light, control of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (do they really have any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne into <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, a neatly segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December, the U.S. NIE (representing the {{consensus}} view of all 16 American spy agencies) [...] "judged with high confidence" [...] that Iran had halted {{its nuclear weapons}} program in 2003, with [...] "moderate confidence" [...] that the program remains frozen, and with [...] "moderate-to-high confidence" [...] that Iran is [...] "keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons". The estimate said that the enrichment program could still provide Iran with enough raw material to produce a nuclear weapon sometime by <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> decade but that intelligence agencies [...] "do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons" [...] at some future date. Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate in 2008, said he hoped the administration would [...] "appropriately adjust its rhetoric and policy". The conclusion that Iran had a nuclear weapons program in 2003 was reportedly mainly based on the contents of a laptop computer that was allegedly stolen from Iran and provided to US intelligence agencies by dissidents. The Russians dismissed this conclusion, stating that they had not seen evidence that Iran had ever pursued a nuclear weapons program.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 December, Abbas {{called for}} new {{parliamentary}} and presidential elections, but his advisor Saeb Erekat said that [...] "elections cannot be held before <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>next</b> year for legal and technical reasons". A senior Hamas lawmaker called it [...] "a real coup against the democratically elected government". Hamas challenged {{the legality of}} holding an early election, maintaining its right to hold the full term of its elected offices. Hamas characterized it as an attempted Fatah coup by Abbas, using undemocratic means to overthrow {{the results of a}} democratically elected government. Fatah leaders called for the dismissal of the Hamas-led government and the establishment of an emergency cabinet. One Fatah operative said that Abbas had been threatening to call early elections for the past five months and that [...] "more threats are not going to work". The announcement of elections provoked high tensions and gun battles between Hamas and Fatah supporters. Abbas strongly denied allegations that members of Fatah and the Force 17 [...] "Presidential Guard" [...] were behind the assassination attempt on Ismail Haniyeh, and he criticized the kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.|$|E
