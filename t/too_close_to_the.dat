5|$|Archaeological {{work had}} failed to find {{artefacts}} and recognizable phytoliths, also the site seemed <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea – even though the dimensions, layout and orientation approximated published descriptions by both Delahaye and Labillardière.|$|E
5|$|The World Cruise of 1907–1909 {{tested the}} {{seakeeping}} of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, including the Connecticut class with their higher freeboard, carried their secondary armament <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waterline.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 2012, it was {{reported}} that an incident occurred when testing The Swarm. Limbs of test dummies were broken off when the ride passed an object that was located <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> track. The Daily Mail suggested that the incident might have been a publicity stunt.|$|E

5|$|On 6 April 1941, Adolf Hitler {{resolved}} {{to end the}} conflict in the Balkans and subjugate Allied-sympathetic states. The Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning. The German Wehrmacht also intervened in Greece thus beginning the Battle of Greece. Italian failures had allowed another British foothold on the continent <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romanian oilfields — Germany's ally.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships. Located <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered useless and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.|$|E
5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming that it was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> working title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, {{as soon as the}} name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change by claiming that the Jedi did not seek revenge, only the Sith.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the ships}} were poorly armored {{compared}} to foreign designs in general, the ships' underwater protection {{was the greatest}} weakness in the armor scheme. The torpedo bulkhead was placed <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer hull, which reduced its ability to absorb damage. This weakness {{played a central role}} in the loss of both España to grounding in 1923 and the sinking of Alfonso XIII by a single mine in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Written by Brian Hayles. Hayles was {{commissioned}} {{to write a}} storyline for “The Nazis” on March 8, 1966. Shortly thereafter, however, he was engaged to write The Smugglers, which he was told should take a higher priority. “The Nazis” was ultimately abandoned on June 15, 1966, with the sentiment being that the events it portrayed were <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present day.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E

5|$|Black's {{contact in}} the Seattle Police Department, Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), insists that Black should not get {{involved}} in the case as he is <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victims. However, Black insists he can be of assistance, and reviews security footage of a stranger investigating Tom's luggage after their flight. Bletcher reports that a stolen car has been found abandoned, with Helen's blood inside. Fellow Millennium Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) helps Black identify the kidnapper from a set pictures of sex offenders in the Seattle area—Black recognizes Richard Green (Dylan Haggerty) as the man from the airport footage.|$|E
5|$|Hextall's first {{international}} recognition {{came when he}} was named as part of Team Canada's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup. During a practice session, he chopped Sylvain Turgeon's arm with his stick during a scrimmage, claiming that the left wing was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goal. Turgeon missed the tournament with a fractured arm; Hextall was back-up to Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game. He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships, playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2.86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White-sided Dolphin. The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{stability}} of an inflationary solution in an induced gravity model requires that the initial conditions should be <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> condition ϕ_ 0 ∂_ϕ_ 0 V(ϕ_ 0) = 4 V(ϕ_ 0) under the slow rollover approximation. It is found that the induced gravity model tends <b>to</b> stabilize <b>the</b> inflationary phase if the initial conditions get <b>too</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> condition ϕ_ 0 ∂_ϕ_ 0 V(ϕ_ 0) = 4 V(ϕ_ 0). The presence of higher derivative terms will act against the stabilily of this expanding solution unless a strong constraint on the possible field parameters and possible scalar potential is obeyed. Some models are analyzed for their implication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early universe...|$|R

40|$|RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) is {{proposed}} and implemented. The innovation of the algorithm is the RSSI optimization and GIS auxiliary positioning. The RSSI optimization can reduces the error caused when the blind code is <b>too</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reference node, and GIS auxiliary positioning is <b>to</b> solve <b>the</b> {{problem that the}} number of the reference codes in the communication radius of blind code is less than three. Experimental Results Indicate that Global positioning algorithm has the average vertical positioning error less than 4 m, the horizontal error less than 1 / 2 roadway width, and the positioning cycle less than 1 s, with better positioning and tracking performance, and expands the coverage of the network of underground positioning...|$|R
5|$|The {{first task}} is to polish Howard's belt buckles. Howard tends to stand <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> urinal and urine often {{splashes}} back onto the buckles. Sheldon is given a black light and several dozen belt buckles to clean. Sheldon performs the task flawlessly. For his second task, Sheldon is forced to wear a French maid costume that Howard originally bought for his girlfriend Bernadette (Melissa Rauch). Sheldon {{is seen in the}} cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is thought}} to be monogamous, though its {{breeding}} habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of cooperative breeding, with some mated pairs being assisted by up to several other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, mobbing and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally dogs or people. They may attack animals (and people) that venture <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind.|$|E
5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater {{so as not to be}} <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> screen during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E
50|$|During the confusion, the Ground Proximity Warning sounded. The crew {{ignored the}} warning.

50|$|The actual vote gave Kerry 252 to Bush's 286. Using nonpartisan {{polls and}} {{averaging}} {{a few days}} worth of polls did best.

5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, {{and attempted to}} launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|With {{the first}} vessel approved, the General Board {{attempted}} to secure two, or possibly {{three of the}} 5"/51-cal. guns in November, but the Bureau of Construction and Repair informed the board that only two guns would fit in the existing hull design. A third gun placed aft would be <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rudder, and the hull could not support the recoil from the gun. A substitution of the larger guns would also necessitate {{a reduction in the}} ammunition allotment, from 350rounds per gun to 250. Ultimately, the Ashville class emerged as incremental improvements over Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} Commissioner Bud Selig {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8p.m. ET {{for the first time}} in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1p.m. to avoid it ending <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> start of Game4. Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|E
