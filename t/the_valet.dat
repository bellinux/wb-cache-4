5|$|The Heart of Ezra Greer is a 1917 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Emile Chautard. The film focuses on Ezra Greer, a successful middle-aged man who searches for his college age daughter, Mary. The wayward Mary was romanced and abandoned by Jack Denbeigh, later bearing his child. Once Ezra becomes broke he finds employment as <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> for Jack Denbeigh. After Jack's engagement to a cabaret girl, Mary becomes upset and leaves her child at Jack's home. Contrary to Jack's wishes, Ezra keeps the child and Jack ultimately reveals {{that the child is}} his own. Ezra convinces Jack to make things right and Ezra convinces the cabaret girl to leave Jack. After a carriage accident in which the baby is injured, Ezra and Jack rush to the hospital and find Mary as a nurse crying over the child. The film ends with the marriage of Jack and Mary. The film was released by Pathé on October 7, 1917. The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers. Criticism for the film hinged on far-fetched coincidences to drive the plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Leading up {{to their}} match at No Mercy, Jeff Jarrett would taunt Chyna and hit her with random {{household}} objects. He also began a gimmick where he would degrade women, which involved him attacking female WWF employees.

He challenged Vampiro in episode four, as a ruse to introduce Ricky Banderas, who attacked Vampiro from behind. He later defeated Human Tornado and Scorpio Sky in singles matches, and teased an affair with Lizzy Valentine (<b>the</b> <b>valet</b> and girlfriend of Matt Sydal), though WSX folded before the angle could go on any further.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in Paris. His father, Jehan Perrichon, was a viol and shawm player, also for the royal court. As a child Jehan {{probably}} learned to play the lute from the king's renowned lutenist, Vaumesnil. Court records mention him as {{a student of the}} lute from 1576 to 1578, at which time he was likely studying with Jean de la Fontaine or Samuel de La Roche, who were then the king's lutenists. While Perrichon's life has not yet been the subject of a scholarly study, records indicate he was formally <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> de chambre to Henry IV sometime before 1595, a position he likely retained until his early death around 1600; neither the details of his employment nor the circumstances of his death are yet known.|$|E
25|$|The bullet {{which killed}} Chevenix hit the gong (as {{the door to}} the study was open), which made Susan think that she heard the first gong (dinner was usually served after <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> would strike the gong 2 times), and it was Ms Lingard who smashed the mirror and made the whole affair look like suicide. She blew a paper bag to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, and he had no evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays alone in the room, she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her real mother. Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who wonders why Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E
25|$|His early {{sketches}} gained him a {{place in}} the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. However, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, where several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> de chambre of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.|$|E

25|$|Serving as a watchtower for pirate raids, an {{administrative}} centre {{and a place}} of incarceration the castle saw next to no fighting. In 1191, it was taken by Richard the Lionheart during his campaign against the island's ruler Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus. Richard subsequently sold the island to the Knights Templar whose rule abruptly ended after a major revolt in Nicosia. Cyprus was thus resold to the Guy of Lusignan of the House of Lusignan. A period of peace ended {{with the death of}} Hugh I of Cyprus in 1218. A struggle over who should act as the kingdom's regent ensued, pitting the House of Ibelin with the local supporters of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick's arrival in Limassol in 1228 escalated the conflict into an open war. In 1229, the castle came under siege by the Ibelins, who bombarded it with trebuchets, reportedly destroying several buildings. The castle's garrison surrendered a year later when its commander Gauvain de Cheneche was killed by a crossbow bolt. Afterwards, the Lusignans continued their reign interrupted only by occasional palace coups. In 1373, Cyprus was invaded by the Republic of Genoa imprisoning the local nobility. According to Philip of Novara's chronicle prince John of Antioch managed to escape from Famagusta after disguising himself as <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> of his cook. John subsequently fled to Kantara, from which he organised a successful counter offensive that expelled the Genoese after the latter failed to capture Kantara.|$|E

These [...] called valet de chambres, grooms or pages, ranking {{from top to bottom}} in that order [...] were most often young boys, although in the larger royal courts <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> de chambres included both young noble courtiers, and often artists, musicians and other specialists who might be of international repute.

Priam marries the woman under the name Henry Leek. Lack of funds causes Priam to resume his painting, and when his work is recognized he refuses to admit his identity. But when it develops that the late Leek had a wife and two children, who arrive and demand their rights, Priam begins to weaken and eventually proves that he is Priam Farll on the condition that his identity remain secret to protect against Lady Sophia's breach of promise suit.|$|R

Ivory eventually became <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> for Lance Storm. At No Mercy, Ivory accompanied Storm and The Hurricane to the ring, but the Hardy Boyz defeated the two men to retain their WCW World Tag Team Championship.

Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that [...] "they [...] had everyone but <b>the</b> <b>valet</b> call us" [...] to help secure the franchise.
