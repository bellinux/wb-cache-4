40|$|Introduction: Multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) is {{state of}} the art among the radiation field shaping systems for conformal radiotherapy techniques. Some advantages of this system are as follow: reduction of treatment time, higher precision in conforming the radiation field to the projection of the target volume and lowering the chance of errors made by technologists. The purpose of this research was to design and construct the mechanical section of a prototype MLC.   Material and Methods: The MLC consists of a base plate, 52 leaves, 2 leaf carriages, 2 nuts and 52 <b>triangular</b> <b>thread</b> screws. The leaves are arranged in two opposing banks each containing 26 leaves. The carriages are used to extend the movement of the leaves. The components of the MLC are fabricated by machining processes. The MLC is designed to be mounted on the conventional linear accelerators as an add-on accessory. The leaves were made of aluminum. The dimensions of the leaves are 5 x 200 x 50 mm.   Result: The collimator system weighs approximately 37 kg excluding the leaves. The projected width of each leaf on the isocenter of a Varian linear accelerator is 10 mm. The movement of the leaves is accomplished by using the <b>triangular</b> <b>thread</b> screws. The screws required to have a low axial backlash which in turn results in lower precision positioning of the leaves. The positioning accuracy of each leaf is approximately 1. 4 mm. Discussion and Conclusion: Mashhad MLC system, in it’s present form and design weighs 37 kg. but if Aluminum blades are replaced by tungsten ones then the over all weights of MLC may exceed the weight limit a linac may hold. Therefore futher modifications are required to reduce the MLC total weight. It is desirable to use ball screws and roller cages instead of <b>triangular</b> <b>thread</b> screws to achive a higher positioning pereision of the blade...|$|E
40|$|Background: As various implant {{geometries}} present different biomechanical behaviors, {{the purpose}} of this work was to study stress distribution around tapered and cylindrical threaded implant geometries using three-dimensional finite element stress analysis. Methods : Seven implant models were constructed using Computer Assisted Designing system. After digitized models of mandibular section, the crowns were created. They were combined with implant models, which were previously imported into CATIA software. The combined solid model was transferred to ABAQOUS to create a finite element meshed model which was later analyzed regarding the highest maximum and minimum principal stresses of bone. Results: For all models, the highest stresses of cortical bone were located at the crestal cortical bone around the implant. Threaded implants, <b>triangular</b> <b>thread</b> form and taper body form showed a higher peak of tensile and compressive stress than non-threaded implants, square thread form and straight body form, respectively. A taper implant with triangular threads, which is doubled in the cervical portion of the body, had a significantly lower peak of tensile and compressive stress in the cortical bone than straight/taper triangular or square threaded implant forms. Conclusion: For the investigation of bone implant interfacial stress, the non-bonded state should be studied too. Confirmative clinical and biological studies are required in order to benefit from the results of this study...|$|E

The design replaced the <b>triangular</b> <b>threaded</b> rod frame construction with a water jet cut aluminum frame, had a food-safe hot end called the Prusa Nozzle, and used M5 threaded screws instead of M8. The design focused on ease of construction and use rather than maximising the number of self replicated components. In 2015 Průša released a version which he called the Original Prusa i3, selling through his company Prusa Research.|$|R

During FSW, Forces acting on the tool along the travel distance and defects occurred in the joints are observed with respect constant rotational speed and different welding feeds.

40|$|AbstractThermoplastic {{materials}} are now easily joined by {{friction stir welding}}. Joining of thermoplastics in friction stir welding {{which is based on}} frictional heat generated through contact between a rotating tool and the work piece. The determination of welding parameters {{plays an important role in}} weld strength. In friction stir welding of thermoplastics, traditional tools form a slit on the backside of welded specimen which leads to root defect causes poor tensile strength. Due to the high transparency of this polymer, it was to possible to analyse easily the morphological changes induced by the welding process on it. In this investigation the welding parameters studied were the tool rotation speed which varied between 800 and 1200 (rpm), transverse speed which varied between 40 and 200 (mm/min), axial force ranging from 1 to 5 (KN). An attempt was made to join the polypropylene plate of 5 mm thickness with different tool profiles (square, cylindrical and <b>triangular</b> <b>threaded</b> pin profile). The quality of the joint was evaluated by means of tensile strength and micro structural analysis...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{possibility}} of asymmetric transmission induced by a non-Hermitian scattering center embedded in a one-dimensional waveguide, motivated by the aim of realizing quantum diode in a non-Hermitian system. It is shown that a PT symmetric non-Hermitian scattering center always has symmetric transmission although the dynamics within the isolated center can be unidirectional, especially at its exceptional point. We propose a concrete scheme based on a flux-controlled non-Hermitian scattering center, which comprises a non-Hermitian <b>triangular</b> ring <b>threaded</b> by an Aharonov-Bohm flux. The analytical solution shows that such a complex scattering center acts as a diode at the resonant energy level of the spectral singularity, exhibiting perfect unidirectionality of the transmission. The connections between the phenomena of the asymmetric transmission and reflectionless absorption are also discussed. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Threaded {{connections}} {{as found}} in applications like rigid riser, drillstrings, and workover riser are manufactured with sharp notches. Subjected to cyclic loading, those notches lead to high stress concentrations, which {{increase the risk of}} fatigue crack initiation significantly. A common connection type that has been the basis for extensive studies is the API Line Pipe connection. The basic API thread type consists of truncated <b>triangular</b> <b>threads.</b> In order to tighten the connection the male and female part or pin and box are assembled by applying a make-up torque. This process already leads to stress in the connection that exceed the material yield strength at the roots of the threads. Subjected to cyclic loading a complex stress state arises at the thread roots of both parts of the connection. From screwed connections it is known that approximately half of the axial load is carried by the last engaged thread. Consequently, fatigue cracks develop at this location. Fatigue assessment of threaded riser connections (TRC) is commonly based on a peak stress approach. This is the prescribed method in standards and recommended practices like DNV-RP-C 203, BS 7608 or ASME B 31. 3. For this purpose, the peak stress {{at the root of the}} last engaged thread is found by finite element analysis (FEA). Subsequently, a given design curve is corrected for the notch effect of the thread root and the fatigue life of a connection can be calculated by means of linear damage accumulation. It was shown in different research projects that fatigue assessment of TRC based on this method leads to overly conservative lifetime estimates when combining design curves with FEA. In order to achieve more precise lifetime estimates, alternative fracture mechanics methods based on ASME BPVC VIII- 3 -App. D have been applied. The intention was to establish stress-life diagrams for design purposes of threaded riser connections based on alternative methods. Moreover, comparison of the chosen approach and test results was included to review the obtained results. It was found that the chosen fracture mechanics methods yield unconservative results, when compared with test data, common stress - life design curves and other methods based on the peak stress approach. </p...|$|R

FSW process was successfully extended to join {{thermoplastic materials}}. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand the mechanism of friction stir welding joints of polypropylene plates. In this study, the role of FSW tool pin profile, rotational speed and welding speed are analyzed with respective {{to the quality of the}} joints.

50|$|When a fly was {{put into}} a jar {{containing}} a K. alba, the female dropped from {{the underside of the}} lid on what seemed a single thread about 12 mm long and hung there until the fly blundered into her. Then she clamped her legs around it and killed it. Instead of constructing orb webs, they construct a small trapezoidal web, containing two <b>triangular</b> zigzags of <b>threads,</b> which is remade every twenty minutes. The spider then hangs upside-down by the fourth leg on the lower and shorter parallel edge of the trapezoid, which is spread by the other legs. When a moth flies into the basket formed by the spider's legs, it is clasped and bitten, and later wrapped in araneid-like fashion. The moth is then hung from a trapeze line between the last legs of the spider, which resumes the hunting posture. As many as eight moths can be caught in this way before the spider starts feeding.|$|R
50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a thread pitch angle of 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO metric thread form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the <b>thread's</b> <b>triangular</b> height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and crests of the thread {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the thread's depth is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO metric thread, where screws must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt heads and nuts is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|R
