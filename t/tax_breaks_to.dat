500|$|Small-scale farmers also {{protested that}} Hamilton's excise {{effectively}} gave unfair <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> large distillers, {{most of whom}} were based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee or paying by the gallon. Large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the less tax per gallon they would pay (as low as 6cents, according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9cents), which made them less competitive. The regressive nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Small-scale distillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them and promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians. However, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that a [...] "conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document". Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.|$|E

40|$|Every {{state in}} the United States with an income tax offers some kind of <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>to</b> its older citizens. These breaks are often sizable, {{resulting}} in an elderly household owing substantially less in income taxes than a non-elderly household with the same income. In this brief, author Karen Smith Conway examines these state income <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for the elderly, describing how they work, their distributional and revenue effects, and whether these policies affect migration. She reports that existing state income <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> for the elderly result in non-trivial reductions in state revenue and offer little relief to the most vulnerable elderly. Data on interstate migration yield little evidence that these <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> pay for themselves by inducing the elderly to remain in or move to the state. Proposed additional <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> would primarily benefit high-income elderly households, while the existing breaks primarily benefit middle- and high-income elderly households...|$|R
