50|$|Freeze {{could also}} be in three forms - <b>temporary,</b> <b>permanent</b> and controlled. Temporary meant that once the client count dropped to zero, the library would be unfrozen and terminated. Permanent meant that the library {{remained}} available for further clients even if the client count dropped to zero - permanent libraries could be unfrozen by an operator with a THAW command. A controlled freeze meant that the library actually kept running, {{so that it could}} execute monitoring functions and perform data initialization and cleanup functions for each linking client.|$|E
50|$|For , race {{organizers}} {{planned to}} move the race to a new temporary circuit on Belle Isle, a city park in the Detroit River. Along with the criticism of the downtown circuit, local developers were planning to begin construction along portions of the course. The relocation plan was immediately met with stiff local opposition, both public and political. Even though the circuit would be <b>temporary,</b> <b>permanent</b> garages and pit facilities {{would have had to}} be constructed, at significant expense, and at the odds of conservation groups. In October 1988, the plan was scrapped. Formula One left Detroit permanently, with the U.S. Grand Prix moved to Phoenix.|$|E

Using data on Spanish establishments, we examine: (a) how employers adjust <b>temporary</b> and <b>permanent</b> job and worker flows to prior employment expectations, and (b) how the 1994 and 1997 labour reforms promoting permanent employment affected establishments’ employment practices. Generally, establishments’ prior employment expectations are realized through changes in all job and worker flows. However, establishments uniquely rely on temporary hires as a buffer to confront diminishing long-run employment expectations.

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} recent South Korean labor reform, {{which was designed to}} protect temporary workers, on the level of <b>temporary,</b> <b>permanent,</b> and overall employment in that country. Because the effects of employment protection legislation (EPL) on employment levels remain theoretically ambiguous, they must be determined by empirical analysis. The impacts of the reform on both temporary and overall employment are negative at first and fade away in two years after the reform, hence taking a U-shape in the post-reform period. The impact of the reform on permanent employment is, however, positive two years after the reform. At least in the short run, an increase in protection for workers comes at a cost of reduced levels of employment...|$|E
40|$|We study {{two kinds}} of buy-it-now options, {{temporary}} and permanent, under a theoretical model of Stackelberg game. In this two-stage game, the bidders, as the followers, use a two-threshold strategy to determine whether to bid or directly buy the item at the posted price, given an auction configuration featured by the seller {{in the first stage}} and other common knowledge. Under the uniform distribution assumption for the bidders' valuation, we derive the optimal necessary conditions of the starting price and the buy-it-now price for maximizing the seller's expected revenue. Then, we use two numerical experiments to find some interesting insights, which include that under identical bidders' participation costs, the temporary buy-it-now option can acquire a higher expected revenue for the seller than the permanent option, and a buy-it-now price auction always nontrivially dominates a regular auction in terms of the achieved expected revenue, no matter whether the seller or the bidders are risk-averse.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how civilian workers managed stress at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, after the 1991 Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC) selected the post for closure. The post shut down operations in September 1995, two {{years ahead of}} the schedule mandated by related legislation. After the closure announcement in April 1991, a number of events further compounded the problem of base closure. First, there was a deep recession in New England. Second, general downsizing {{of the federal government}} and of the Department of Defense, in particular, severely decreased potential job opportunities for many workers. These events created a climate of stress at Fort Devens. ^ At the same time closure was announced, Fort Devens made available to all civilian employees the opportunity to attend a lifestyle management course called Fit to Win, the purpose of which was not stress management but better fitness through exercise and proper nutrition. This {{study examines}} how employees coped with the stress of losing their jobs at Fort Devens, and to what degree the Fit to Win program was an effective tool in helping them manage their stress. ^ Qualitative research methods were used. A case study with in-depth interviewing was the primary mode of inquiry. The study was composed of a purposeful sample of six civilian Fort Devens employees who also attended the Fit to Win course of instruction. In addition to taped and transcribed interviews, an interviewer 2 ̆ 7 s journal was also used to conduct the research. The findings suggest that Fit to Win is an effective lifestyle management program. All of the participants thought the course content was sound and the results were worthwhile. Those individuals who fully engaged in the program, theoretically and in application, reaped the greatest rewards. The findings also suggest that Fit to Win has varied impact on participants: <b>temporary,</b> <b>permanent,</b> and no change. ^ Additionally, the findings suggest that a lifestyle management program comprised of exercise and nutritional guidance can effectively help individuals to cope with stress. Furthermore, the findings suggest that Fit to Win education can be a vehicle for successful transition from stress management to lifestyle management, or improved wellness. ...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is {{the ability}} of a genotype to express different phenotypes in different environments. Despite its common occurrence, few have investigated differences in plasticity between populations, the selection pressures responsible for it, and costs and constraints associated with it. In this thesis, I investigated this by studying local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in populations of the common frog Rana temporaria, inhibiting islands with different pool types (<b>temporary,</b> <b>permanent</b> or both). The tadpoles develop in these pools, and have to finish metamorphosis before the pool dries out. I found that the tadpoles were locally adapted both in development time and in phenotypic plasticity of development time. Tadpoles from islands with temporary pools had a genetically shorter development time than tadpoles from islands with permanent pools. The population differentiation in development time, estimated as QST, was larger than the population differentiation in neutral molecular markers (FST), which suggest that divergent selection among the populations is responsible for the differentiation. Moreover, tadpoles from islands with more variation in pool drying regimes had higher phenotypic plasticity in development time than tadpoles from islands with only one pool type present. Interestingly, increased migration among populations did not select for increased plasticity, rather it was the local environmental variation that was important. This adaptation has occurred over a short time scale, as the islands are less than 300 generations old. In temporary pools, it is adaptive to finish development before the pool dries out. This could be achieved by entering the metamorphosis at a smaller size, as a smaller size takes shorter time to reach. However, I found that there is a minimum threshold size below which tadpoles’ cannot enter metamorphosis, and that there had been no evolution of this threshold size in populations living in temporary environments. That suggests that this developmental threshold is tightly linked to physiological constraints in the developmental process. Despite their expected importance as constrains on the evolution of plasticity, costs of plasticity are often not found in nature.   However, theories of why they are absent have not been tested empirically. In this thesis, I show that fitness costs of phenotypic plasticity are only found in populations with genotypes expressing high levels of phenotypic plasticity, while in populations with low-plastic genotypes, I find costs of not being plastic. This suggests that costs of plasticity increase with increased level of plasticity in the population, and that might be a reason why costs of plasticity are hard to detect...|$|E
