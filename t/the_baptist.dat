5|$|In August 1906, a {{group of}} Cleveland Baptists {{incorporated}} an organization, <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who was a Baptist. With the aid of local churches, the home was opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> Home served fourteen residents {{at the end of}} 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000.

5|$|Despite the title, St. John <b>the</b> <b>Baptist</b> Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture.

Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E

A difference in practice between <b>the</b> <b>Baptists</b> with whom he was connected in Illinois and <b>the</b> <b>Baptists</b> in Arkansas was evidently a contributing factor to the rise of the Kelley division of <b>the</b> missionary <b>Baptist</b> church.

5|$|After the council, Cuthbert {{continued}} {{to correspond with}} Boniface up until Boniface's martyrdom in 754, and then sent condolences to Boniface's successor.

He was buried in his new church. The new church was located {{on the west side}} of the cathedral, and was used as a baptistery. The church also became a burial site for many of the archbishops, and later was used for trials by ordeal.
