25|$|The {{division}} {{itself was}} assigned to VIII Corps, and spread out along the southern coast of Cornwall and Devon. The Dorset County Division was based {{to the east of}} the division, and the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division had been placed in reserve behind both formations. The 203rd Brigade was positioned on the western flank of the division's assigned area, and the 209th Brigade on the eastern. The battalions were spread out defending various potential landing areas and other important locations. The coastal defensive positions the division occupied included <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolding</b> obstacles on the high water mark, barbed wire, minefields, beach front defensive fighting positions equipped with a range of modern and antiquated weaponry such as Maxim machine guns.|$|E
50|$|In days gone by, {{scaffolding}} {{was erected}} by individual firms with wildly varying standards and sizes. Scaffolding was revolutionized by Daniel Palmer Jones and David Henry Jones. Modern day scaffolding standards, practices and processes {{can be attributed}} to these men and their companies. With Daniel being the better known and patent applicant and holder for many scaffold components still in use today see inventor:"Daniel Palmer-Jones". He is considered the grandfather of Scaffolding. The history of scaffolding being that of the Jones brothers and their company's Patent Rapid Scaffold Tie Company Ltd, <b>Tubular</b> <b>Scaffolding</b> Company and Scaffolding Great Britain Ltd (SGB).|$|E

40|$|Some {{structural}} design concepts of <b>tubular</b> steel <b>scaffolding</b> are presented herein. Factors {{that are considered}} in the design are loading condition, basic structural element, bracing, fonndation and ancillary fittings. Emphasis {{is given to the}} use of modular frame scaffoldings according to the standards in some countries. Finally, the result of system performance test on a typical modular frame scaffolding system produced locally is presented. The results shows that the frame system has high' buckling load capacity arid complies with the standard specification...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} achieve the look of Legend that he wanted, Scott scouted {{locations}} in the Sequoias of Yosemite National Park to see the grand scale of trees there. [...] "The whole environment is so stunning ... It was so impressive, but I didn't know how you would control it". [...] However, it would cost too much to shoot on location {{and he decided to}} build a forest set on the 007 Stage, named after and used for many James Bond films, at Pinewood Studios. The crew spent 14 weeks constructing the forest set, and Scott was worried that it would not look real enough. It was only days before the start of principal photography that it looked good enough to film. The trees were 60 feet high with trunks 30 feet in diameter and were sculpted out of polystyrene built onto <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolding</b> frames. In addition, other sets were constructed on five huge soundstages.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Cuplok Steel <b>Tubular</b> <b>Scaffolding</b> (hereinafter {{referred}} to as Bowl-scaffold) is an important temporary facility in bridge construction, which is widely used in the overpass bridge, viaduct and other long-span constructions. But its importance is often overlooked, because compared with the whole project, the Bowl-scaffold is only a temporary facility and its quantity is limited. In recent years several serious collapses {{have taken place in}} China which occurred in accident-prone scaffold areas. Therefore, its stability and safety should attract more attention. The mechanical characteristics of the Bowl- scaffold is deeply researched through the analysis of scaffolding features, the node status, the type and distribution of load, and the arrangement of the bars. Then, based on the mechanical characteristics analysis and on-site construction work, the factors that affect the stability and bearing capacity of the scaffoldings are analyzed. At last, measures ensuring the bearing capacity, stability and safety are put forward from design to construction...|$|E
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{has become the}} leading cause of death in the United States, with over 425, 000 deaths in 2006. Stenting has evolved into the {{preferred}} preventative technique for myocardial infarction by opening up an occluded artery, due to its low invasiveness compared to the alternative of coronary artery bypass grafting. Bare metal stents have been improved by coating with anti-proliferative drugs to advance their effects, but even drug eluting stents still have a risk of restenosis, thrombus formation, and necessary revascularization. Continual advancement in stent design necessitates faster, effective pre-clinical evaluation techniques. Kristen Cardinal, Ph. D., developed the blood vessel mimic for in-vitro evaluation of coronary stents. The blood vessel mimic currently uses ePTFE as a <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolding</b> for vessel development, but this material falls short of the mechanical properties of the native vessel. Aubrey Smith, M. S., developed a protocol for decellularizing porcine arteries. Decellularization is the process of removing cells from a native tissue, leaving only the extracellular matrix scaffold. The decellularized vessels could be a potential replacement for ePTFE in the blood vessel mimic. The present study was done to replicate the protocol developed by Ms. Smith, and evaluate if it produces repeatable results. Methods included decellularization of porcine arteries by perfusion with sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, and evaluation using histology as well as uniaxial tensile testing. Results from this study were similar to those found by Ms. Smith, indicating that the protocol does produce repeatable decellularized arteries...|$|E
40|$|At the Turin Fiat factory an {{elevated}} water tank has been built, with {{a capacity of}} 2, 000 m 3 60 m above the ground, and cup shaped. The structure is reinforced concrete, and prefabricated panels are used, which are supported by a concrete disc, a cylindrical crown and radial ribs. The whole rests on piles. The stem is 8 m in diameter, and has been constructed {{with the aid of}} U shaped cylindrical panels, 3 cm in thickness, which served as external formwork for the stem walls. These are 60 cm thick at the bottom, and 50 cm at the top. The tank itself is a paraboloid, made with triangular panels which together form conical circular rings. These also served as formwork, and were supported by a <b>tubular</b> <b>scaffolding.</b> An observation post has been built on top of the tank. It is 25 m in diameter, and is covered with a ribbed spherical cupola, supported by hinged columns, which allow radial deformations, which are not transmitted to the top ring of the tank. The latter, being full of water, is kept at a more uniform temperature than the cupular roof, which is fully exposed to the weather. En la factoría Fiat, de Turín (Italia), se ha construido este depósito elevado, en forma de copa, de 2. 000 m 3 de capacidad y unos 60 m de altura sobre el suelo. Es de hormigón armado y paneles prefabricados, apoyándose sobre un disco de hormigón, una corona cilíndrica y contrafuertes radiales; todo lo cual descansa sobre pilotes. El fuste, de 8 m de diámetro, se ha construido con la ayuda de una serie de paneles, de superficie cilíndrica y sección transversal en forma de U con alas asimétricas, de 3 cm de espesor, que sirvieron de encofrado exterior en el hormigonado de las paredes, cuyo espesor varía de 60 cm en la zona inferior a 50 cm en la superior. La cubeta es un meridiano parabólico de revolución, constituido por paneles triangulares, formando anillos troncocónicos, que se utilizaron también como encofrado, apoyado sobre un entramado tubular en voladizo. Encima de la cubeta se ha construido un mirador, de 25 m de diámetro, cubierto con una cúpula nervada esférica, soportada por montantes articulados que permiten movimientos radiales sin transmitir momentos flectores al anillo superior del depósito, el cual, por estar lleno de agua, tiene temperaturas más regulares y diferente dilatación que la cúpula...|$|E
