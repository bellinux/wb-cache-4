A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of <b>the</b> <b>Broad</b> Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880.

5|$|Historically, the South Lake Union {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, located {{to the north}} of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by <b>the</b> <b>Broad</b> Street Substation. After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a large city park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million substation in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, expecting the additional high tech firms to put a strain on <b>the</b> <b>Broad</b> Street substation and neighborhood lines laid in the early 2000s.
