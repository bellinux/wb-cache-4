5|$|Gonzalo de Alvarado {{and his men}} {{decided to}} remain; the area was {{apparently}} well-populated enough to provide worthwhile tribute, {{and the existence of}} precious metal deposits in the region had already been established by earlier forays. Alvarado decided to found the new town of Gracias a Dios at Opoa, rather than at the nearby site that had been set aside by Chávez. In late 1536, Gonzalo de Alvarado finally founded the new town, assigning officials as had been designated by his brother. Although 100 citizens had been assigned by Pedro de Alvarado, in reality it had about 40 upon its foundation. The town only remained at Opoa for a brief period, before it was transferred to a new site. Gonzalo and his men campaigned <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> control over a wide area, penetrating as far as the Comayagua valley. Although claiming conquest of a wide region, Gonzalo had too few soldiers to effectively control it. Native resistance was such that the colonists were soon threatened by starvation, and the natives refused to serve the Spanish. San Pedro was in a similar situation, and was unable to provide any kind of relief to Gracias a Dios. The colonists appealed to Maldonado in Guatemala for assistance, and were informed that Francisco de Montejo would soon be taking up governorship, and would provide any assistance necessary.|$|E

40|$|In an {{influential}} 1973 essay American political scientist R.

He dubbed his subjects 'secular modernizing intellectuals'. Their characteristics included a commitment <b>to</b> <b>imposing</b> <b>their</b> particular conception of 'modernization' upon policy-makers, 'their articulateness, their command of elite newspapers, and their self-proclaimed role as conscience of the regime', and their 'inability to unite organizationally'. But Liddle saw their primary characteristics as the 'intensity of their activities both in ideological formulation and dissemination and... their willingness to act upon their beliefs'. It is this ideology and its intellectual antecedents which primarily occupied Liddle, who argued that though 'their views have dominated public political discussion since 1967 [...] . their influence- {{in the sense of}} success in achieving their objectives - has been minimal'...|$|R

25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. Axial fans operate at high specific speed i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, they are unable <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and outlet velocity triangles meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|E

The death of Attila in 453 allowed the Ostragoths to scatter his Hunnish empire. Many tribes, formerly under the Huns now started to settle along the Danube basin and assert their independence. Among these were the Rugii, who formed their own lands (Rugiland) across the Danube and started <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> will on Noricum.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between priests and warriors was important, because {{the concept of}} Ērānshahr had been revived by the priests. Without this relationship, the Sassanid Empire would not have survived in its beginning stages. Because of this {{relationship between}} the warriors and the priests, religion and state were considered inseparable in the Zoroastrian religion. However, it is this same relationship that caused the weakening of the Empire, when each group tried <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> <b>their</b> power onto the other. Disagreements between the priests and the warriors led to fragmentation within the empire, which led to its downfall.|$|E

An attempt is made to locate the concept within wider theoretical frameworks, and in particular to relate it to Bourdieu’s notion of cultural capital.

The Hungarian historiography sees this as a mere formality. Within the Habsburg Empire, Transylvania was administratively part of Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatment}} of {{slaves in the}} United States varied widely depending on conditions, times and places. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty.

Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert {{the dominance of the}} master or overseer of the slave. Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.|$|E

25|$|In {{industrial}} cities local {{experts and}} reformers, especially after 1890, {{took the lead}} in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.

It was founded by artist Sir William Blake Richmond, frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the Public Health Act 1875 required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke.
