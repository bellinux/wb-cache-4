25|$|Buggy Races – Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around Schenley Park.

The {{vehicles}} are unpowered, including the prohibition of such energy-storing devices as flywheels. They are, however, steered by a driver who is usually a petite female student lying prone, arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanism. Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their heads.|$|E
