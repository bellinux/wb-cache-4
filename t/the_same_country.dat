5|$|Hurricane Rick was the second-latest {{hurricane}} ever {{to make landfall}} in Mexico. The eighteenth named storm, {{ninth and}} final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Rick was a short-lived Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. It hit almost {{a month after the}} more powerful Hurricane Pauline made landfall in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country.</b> Most of the damage associated with Pauline was exacerbated by the weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5|$|Cyclonic Storm Komen was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near the southern coast of Bangladesh and later struck <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal.

5|$|In One Day International cricket, Richards {{made his}} debut during the 1975 Cricket World Cup in England. He scored his first century the {{following}} year in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country,</b> during the first ODI match of the tour, remaining 119 not out. He holds the two highest scores by a West Indian batsman in ODI cricket, 181 against Sri Lanka in 1987 and 189 not out against England in 1984. His score of 189 not out was also the highest score by any ODI batsman for just under 13 years, until it was surpassed by Saeed Anwar's 194. This innings was also named by Wisden as the best ODI innings of all-time in a 2002 list. In total, seven of Richards' eleven centuries were in the top 100, and his 1979 unbeaten 138 against England at Lord's ranked second.|$|E
5|$|Olivia McKoy {{represented}} Jamaica as {{its only}} javelin thrower at the Beijing Olympics. She {{was born in}} Clarendon Parish, which lies in central Jamaica and stretches southwards to the island's southernmost point, and debuted at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by participating in the same event for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> at age 26. Although McKoy did not compete in Athens in 2004, she returned in Beijing {{at the age of}} 34. During the August 18 qualifying round, McKoy participated in the second heat. 26 other athletes competed in her group, and she ranked 17th of them after throwing the javelin 55.51meters. Overall, McKoy ranked 34th out of the 52 athletes who finished the event. She did not advance to the final round.|$|E

The win marked the third time that an American woman had won the Olympic all-around title; Mary Lou Retton and Carly Patterson were the two previous American gold medalists. It was also the fourth {{time in the history of}} the Games that two athletes from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> had taken first and second place in the women's all-around. The last time this was accomplished was the 2000 Olympics, when Romanian gymnasts won gold and silver; Soviet gymnasts also won gold and silver all-around medals at the 1952 and 1960 Games.|$|E

5|$|Prost {{was married}} to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they {{divorced}} sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 October 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990). Prost also has a daughter, Victoria. , Nicolas races in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father. Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and burned his Mercedes-Benz and another one of his road cars. They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country.</b> In December 2015, Prost became a grandfather {{with the birth of}} Nicolas Prost's son Kimi.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country,</b> some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E
5|$|This list of {{autonomous}} areas arranged by country gives an overview {{of autonomous}} areas of the world. An autonomous area is defined as an area {{of a country that}} has a degree of autonomy, or has freedom from an external authority. It is typical for it to be geographically distant from the country, or to be populated by a national minority. Countries that include autonomous areas are often federacies. The autonomous areas differ from federal units and independent states in the sense that they, in relation to the majority of other sub-national territories in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country,</b> enjoy a special status including some legislative powers, within the state (for a detailed list of federated units, see Federated state#List of federal units by federation).|$|E

5|$|The 2008 UEFA Champions League Final was a {{football}} match {{that took place}} on Wednesday, 21 May 2008, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, to determine {{the winner of the}} 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. It was contested by Manchester United and Chelsea, making it an all-English club final {{for the first time in}} the history of the competition. This was only the third time that two clubs from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> had contested the final; the others being the 2000 and 2003 finals. It was the first European Cup final played in Russia, and hence the easternmost final in the tournament's history. It also marked the 100th anniversary of Manchester United's first league triumph, the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, and the 40th anniversary of United's first European Cup triumph in 1968. It was Manchester United's third European Cup final after 1968 and 1999, while it was Chelsea's first.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Olympics {{was created}} to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically {{impossible}} to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, {{it was decided to}} hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although it was intended that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Olympics were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E

5|$|UEFA {{awarded the}} right to host the final to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis after {{considering}} its merits in terms of capacity, stadium infrastructure and dossiers including city and airport agreements and promotional plans. UEFA also conducted a variety of site visits. The Stade de France previously staged the 2000 UEFA Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Valencia, which Madrid won 30 {{and was the first}} time two clubs from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> had faced each other in the final. Saint-Denis was chosen to host the final in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first European Cup final in 1956, held in nearby Paris at the Parc des Princes, now home of Paris Saint-Germain. The Parc des Princes also hosted the 1975 and 1981 European Cup finals, the 1978 and 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, and the 1998 UEFA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United and Chelsea {{had played}} each other 150 times {{prior to the}} Champions League final, with 18 {{meetings}} in domestic cup competitions (including the FA Community Shield). Due to various historical restrictions regarding the number of teams from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>country</b> entering European competitions, they had never met in Europe before. Manchester United held {{the upper hand in}} the teams' 150 previous meetings, winning 65 times to Chelsea's 41, with 44 draws. Their cup record was equally good, winning 10 of the 18 cup meetings, with the remaining eight ties split equally between draws and Chelsea wins. However, honours were even in cup finals, with Manchester United having won the 1994 FA Cup Final 4–0, while Chelsea won the 2007 FA Cup Final 1–0, the last cup game between the two sides. Manchester United responded to defeat in the 2007 FA Cup Final by beating Chelsea in the 2007 FA Community Shield the following August, winning 3–0 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in normal time. They went on to claim their 17th league title {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 Premier League season, finishing two points ahead of Chelsea. Both teams went into the final game of the season level on points but United were ahead of Chelsea through their superior goal difference. In the two sides' league meetings that season, United won 2–0 at Old Trafford in Avram Grant's first game in charge of Chelsea on 23 September 2007, while Chelsea won 2–1 at Stamford Bridge in the return game on 26 April 2008.|$|E
