5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps to increase <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to match <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, {{which seemed to}} render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage {{at the price of}} reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E

5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below.

These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E

5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) {{of the body is}} found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electric arc {{is a source of}} the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, {{many of which have}} been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{results of}} {{long-term}} photometric observations <b>of</b> R CrBin <b>the</b> UBVJHKLM bands are presented. The temporal and color characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star itself {{and of its}} extended dust envelope are analyzed in detail. No stable harmonic {{has been found in}} <b>the</b> semiregular variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> R CrB. Two harmonics with periods P ≈ 3. 3 and 11. 3 yrs have been detected in <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust envelope; <b>the</b> minima <b>of</b> these variations coincided in 1999, resulting in a record decrease in <b>the</b> LM <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> envelope. This by chance coincided in time with a deep minimum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star, resulting in a unique decrease in <b>the</b> total <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star and dust envelope. This enabled estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bolometric flux <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hot dust clouds, which made up only a few per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bolometric flux <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust envelope. <b>The</b> <b>brightness</b> variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust envelope are not accompanied by appreciable color changes and are associated with variations of its optical depth τ(V) in the range 0. 2 – 0. 4. The dust envelope forms at a large and fairly constant distance from the star (rin ≈ 110 R∗, Tgr ≈ 860 K), from material in its stellar wind, whose intensity (˙ Mgas ≈ 2. 1 × 10 − 7 M⊙/year) obeys a Reimers law. No variations synchronous with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dust envelope, in particular, with the period P ≈ 3. 3 yrs, have been found in <b>the</b> optical emission <b>of</b> R CrB, suggesting that the stellar wind is not spherically symmetric.

It is found that <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A and B rings with solar elevation angle can be well modeled by an optically thick monolayer of particles, or equivalently, a flat sheet, emitting on one side only. This points to a temperature contrast between <b>the</b> two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring plane. <b>The</b> infrared <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C ring increases as the solar elevation angle with respect to the ring plane decreases...|$|R
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun {{can cause}} pain {{from looking at}} it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not {{hazardous}} for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Valve's high-dynamic-range {{technology}} adds {{a significant number of}} lighting effects to the engine, aimed at making the game appear more realistic. Bloom shading was introduced, blurring bright edges in the game world and emulating a camera's overexposure to light. This is combined with exposure control to tailor the effect to represent the human eye. For example, as the player exits a dark area into a light area, the new area is initially glaringly bright, but quickly darkens, representing the adjustment of the player character's eyes to the light. New cube mapping techniques allow the reflection cast by an object to correspond with <b>the</b> <b>brightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light source, and lightmaps enable light bouncing and global illumination {{to be taken into account}} in the rendering. Refraction effects were added to make light account for the physical attributes of an object and to emulate the way light is reflected by water. The Lost Coast level is specifically designed to showcase these effects. It uses the sea and beach as opportunities to demonstrate water-based effects, the monastery to demonstrate bloom from its whitewash walls, and the sanctuary to provide the means to show refraction through stained glass windows and cube maps on golden urns and candlesticks.|$|E
