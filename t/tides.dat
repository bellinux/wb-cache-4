5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap <b>tides,</b> they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring <b>tides.</b>|$|E
5|$|For Galileo, the <b>tides</b> {{were caused}} by the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the <b>tides</b> in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible <b>tides</b> halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of <b>tides,</b> however, his theory was a failure.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Gladys {{produced}} high <b>tides</b> as {{far south}} as Florida and Georgia. Hurricane Gladys' effects on South Carolina was minimal as the center of the hurricane was a considerable distance from the coastline. The only effects Gladys was minor rainfall, peaking at 1inch (25.4mm) in Myrtle Beach, as well as storm <b>tides</b> of 2feet (0.6m) above normal along the upper coast of South Carolina.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in April 2016 at the Strait of Bengkalis, Riau Province. The aim of research {{is to determine the}} pattern salinity and temperature distribution at ebb <b>tide</b> and flood <b>tide.</b> Research used survey method. <b>Tide</b> data obtained were presented in the form of chat the map and discussed descriptively. Based on the research it showed that average salinity at flood <b>tide</b> 23. 56 ‰ and ebb <b>tide</b> 22. 90 ‰. The average of salinity at ebb <b>tide</b> was lower than flood <b>tide.</b> In contrast to the temperature, the temperature measurement at flood <b>tide</b> lower than ebb <b>tide</b> and the average value at flood <b>tide</b> 31, 18 ºC and ebb <b>tide</b> was 31, 53 ºC. The results showed that distribution of salinity and temperature during flood <b>tide</b> and ebb <b>tide</b> is fluctuated. The pattern of distribution of salinity, temperature and other environmental parameters (pH, transparency, current velocity and depth) were different betwen the flood <b>tide</b> and ebb <b>tide...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Earth <b>tide</b> (also {{known as}} solid Earth <b>tide,</b> crustal <b>tide,</b> body <b>tide,</b> bodily <b>tide</b> or land <b>tide)</b> is the {{displacement}} of the solid earth's surface caused by {{the gravity of the}} Moon and Sun. Its main component has meter-level amplitude at periods of about 12 hours and longer. [...] The largest body <b>tide</b> constituents are semi-diurnal, but there are also significant diurnal, semi-annual, and fortnightly contributions.|$|R
30|$|The low near-surface {{salinity}} {{at the far}} {{upstream reach}} of the survey also appeared {{to be influenced by}} the stage of the <b>tide.</b> There the variation with stage of the <b>tide</b> is inferred to range from 0.7 psu at low <b>tide</b> to something greater than 16 psu at high <b>tide,</b> because 0.7 psu was observed there near low <b>tide</b> on 15 October, 7 psu was observed there near a mid-flood <b>tide</b> on 17 October, and 16 psu was observed there near a mid-flood <b>tide</b> on 24 October.|$|R

5000|$|Some <b>tide</b> clocks count {{down the}} number of hours from high or low <b>tide,</b> as in [...] "one hour past high or low tide".

50|$|The way to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} tidal flow at the narrows is to observe the direction in which the <b>tide</b> is flowing.

40|$|Based on {{filtration}} rates {{obtained in}} situ at several habitats (mud flats, sand flats, and seagrass beds of Cymodocea nodosa), particle retention efficiency of benthic communities {{was estimated at}} Ria Formosa, a coastal lagoon in southern Portugal. The distinct physical characteristics of the water flow (water depth, current speed) at different tidal regimes (spring <b>tide</b> and neap <b>tide)</b> were also considered. Median filtration rates ranged 5. 0 − 45. 0 lm− 2 h− 1, {{despite the lack of}} dense bivalve beds or reefs. Based on median filtration rates of benthic communities on the studied substrate types, a model we developed showed that seagrass bed areas retained 15 % of suspended particles during spring <b>tide</b> and 47 % during neap <b>tide.</b> These retention efficiencies were much higher than those observed on mud flats (2. 8 % during spring <b>tide,</b> and 8 % during neap <b>tide),</b> sand flats of finer grain size (8. 8 % during spring <b>tide,</b> and 50 % during neap <b>tide),</b> and sand flats of coarser grain size (7 % during spring <b>tide,</b> and 31 % during neap <b>tide).</b> Removal of particles from water column was higher during the ebb <b>tide</b> than during flow <b>tide,</b> with particles of < 5 μm diameter (especially diatoms, flagellates, and small-sized particulate matter) being the most commonly removed...|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulties}} of definition are considerable in some cases.
