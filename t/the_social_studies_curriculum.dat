40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} {{stems from the}} belief that teaching appropriate values to develop good and active citizens will improve the chaotic situation of the Solomon Islands. However, while this intention seems commendable, little thought {{has been given to}} the nature of Citizenship Education needed in a Solomon Islands context. A concern therefore, is that the curriculum reform agenda will ignore or marginalise the conceptualisation and contextual understanding of Citizenship Education to the extent that <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>curriculum</b> might not end up reflecting a contextually balanced approach to citizenship. In substantiating the concern, this case study research explores the perspectives of education stakeholders in the Solomon Islands on Citizenship Education in <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> <b>curriculum.</b> The study examines the knowledge, values, and skills of Citizenship Education that are relevant and contextual to Solomon Islands.

The study was structured in line with a holistic single case design which is contained in the tradition of qualitative research. The teacher participating in the study is 29 years old and has been serving as a teacher for 7 years. The data collection tools used in the study were semi-structured interview form and observation form. In the process of designing the data collection tools, the literature was reviewed and the expert opinions were taken into account. The expert opinion was also considered with regards to the validity and reliability of the questions included in the interview form and the questions on which the experts had a mutual consensus were determined and included in the list of questions. The content analysis was used in the analysis of the findings obtained from the study and the themes were determined after the records of the interviews had been deciphered. Three themes, which are the nature of the social studies, opinions on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>curriculum,</b> and opinions on how to put into practice <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>curriculum</b> more efficiently in village schools, were determined within the scope of the study.

40|$|This study {{measured}} {{concerns of}} social studies teachers and administrators in a small school {{and the relationship of}} these concerns to the degree of implementation of a social studies curriculum change. Two questionnaires were administered within a six month time period to ten implementers. One survey, the Stages of Concern Questionnaire, adapted from the Concerns-Based Adoption Model of the Research and Development Center for Teacher Education at the University of Texas at Austin, was administered prior to the initial use of the new curriculum and following six months of implementation. In this teachers reported concerns about <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>curriculum</b> innovation and its implementation. The second questionnaire was developed by the researcher and was approved by two university professors who were experts in the social studies field. This instrument measured the degree of implementation of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>curriculum</b> change. ^ Data analysis included individual subject profiles and frequency tables for item response to the Stages of Concern Questionnaire. Data reported on the Implementation Questionnaire were used to determine high and low implementers of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> <b>curriculum</b> change. An ethnographic approach was employed to research in depth the implementation process. ^ Findings in the study indicated: (1) There were no consistently high intensity concerns for either the highest or the second highest concern scores. (2) The high implementers did not unanimously register dominant concerns and there was no apparent agreement on concerns among the low implementers. Low implementers had management and personal concerns that shifted little. High implementers appeared to be shifting toward high level impact concerns. (3) Age, educational background, years of experience, and job assignment were not consistent factors in the degree of implementation. However, entrenched teachers appeared to be less receptive to curricular innovation. ^ Recommendations include the need for further ethnographic studies in a sampling of small schools {{in order to determine the}} satisfaction of teachers with the teaching profession; impact of teacher attitudes toward innovation in school curriculum and determination of the appropriate structure of inservice sessions for low implementers of curriculum change. ...|$|E
