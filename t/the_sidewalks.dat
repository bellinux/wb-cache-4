5|$|In addition, {{there are}} eight {{different}} neighborhood associations, each of which provides different levels of infrastructure on each street. For example, on 4th Street the street lights are designed as old lamp posts and there are ornamented trash cans with a fleur-de-lis symbol at frequent intervals, while on St. James Court there are gas lamp posts, 3rd and 2nd Streets have small light posts on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> Ouerbacker Court has cast iron decorative gates, and several other streets have basic infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of the {{contributing}} properties of the Michigan–Wacker Historic District, which was listed as on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1978. It was also designated as a Chicago Landmark on October 2, 1991. In 2009 <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> and railings on the bridge were replaced, and the bridge was repainted; the design of the new ornamental railings was based on the original 1920 design for the bridge's railings, replacing more utilitarian ones that had been substituted at a later date.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{situated}} in a historically significant area. The northern end of the bridge covers part of the Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite, which is commemorated by a National Historic plaque in Pioneer Court. The southern half of the bridge passes over the site of Fort Dearborn, which was constructed in 1803. The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above {{the entrance of the}} London Guarantee Building, and brass markers positioned in <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> {{on the south side of}} the bridge delineate the posited outline of the original blockhouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}}'s {{effects were}} felt {{as far north}} as Lebanon and Syria and it was the strongest event in the Jordan Rift Valley since the 1927 Jericho earthquake which was centered near the Dead Sea. The heaviest damage occurred in the resort town of Eilat where seven hotels and 50 other buildings were damaged, and cracks formed in <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> Fifteen people were treated there for injuries or shock and one man {{died of a heart attack}} in Aqaba. In Saudi Arabia two women were reported dead and five deaths were reported in Egypt, with three of them occurring in the gulf resort town of Nuweiba. Eight buildings collapsed in Cairo where, just several years before, the much smaller 1992 Cairo earthquake had a much more destructive impact. One person was killed and two were injured slightly at Al-Bad', Saudi Arabia and damage was reported there as well as the towns of Al-`Ula and Haql.|$|E
50|$|When Bart skateboards down <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>the</b> scenery is different, {{the bank}} of {{televisions}} is changed and shorter, and Bart no longer notices them. Instead, he weaves in between a series of secondary characters who crowd <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> This segment is notably shorter than the original skateboard segment.|$|R

5000|$|Shel Silverstein's {{influence}} on poetry {{has been said}} {{to have the ability}} to “Convince children that poetry is neither difficult nor threatening,” he was also able to “understand common childhood thoughts and anxieties.” and his poem, Where <b>the</b> <b>Sidewalk</b> Ends, is no different. Its easy to read, silly vocabulary in combination with the underlying idea that children in fact have the secret to [...] "where <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> ends" [...] makes it fun for children to read. Also, Silverstein had a special insight into the mind of a child, and understood the children's way of thinking relaying that into [...] "Where <b>the</b> <b>Sidewalk</b> Ends." [...] Where <b>the</b> <b>Sidewalk</b> Ends has become a children's poetry launch point, and its lighthearted, engaging style has propelled children to dive into more of Silverstein's poetry and in some cases more poetry in general. Where <b>the</b> <b>Sidewalk</b> Ends, is now a children's poetry classic, and has shaped much of the modern children's poetry that is published today.|$|R

25|$|May 1. Fine weather, to {{the great}} comfort of the {{locomotive}} public. Never knew the city in such a chaotic state. Every other house seems to be disgorging itself into the street; all <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> are lumbered with bureaus and bedsteads to the utter destruction of their character as thoroughfares, and all the space between <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> is occupied by long processions of carts and wagons and vehicles omnigenous laden with perilous piles of moveables. We certainly haven't advanced as a people beyond the nomadic or migratory stage of civilization analogous {{to that of the}} pastoral cow feeders of the Tartar Steppes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{countries}} that use four-way stops, pedestrians always have priority at crosswalks – even at unmarked ones, which exist as the logical continuations of <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> at every intersection with approximately right angles – unless signed or painted otherwise.|$|E

25|$|As on Coney Island, Marsh {{captured}} {{the crowds of}} the bustling inner city life.
