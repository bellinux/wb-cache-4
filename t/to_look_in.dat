In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad luck <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> {{the face of an}} orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Mikl√≥s Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in,</b> but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E

25|$|For {{things that}} may be {{considered}} as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In {{the same way that}} text {{on a piece of paper}} appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction. <b>To</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.|$|E
25|$|Lepuropetalon was {{mentioned}} {{in several other}} publications in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but it remained little known and it was seldom collected for herbaria. There are about 90 known collections of it before 1970. In the 1970s, interest in Lepuropetalon increased and by 1987, when Ward and Gholson wrote of it, there had been 263 collections. Collectors at that time observed that once one learned what sort of areas <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in,</b> Lepuropetalon was easily found. Ward and Gholson provide a detailed map of its distribution in the United States.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} {{possible}} ways to update it. The cheapest {{would have been}} to leave the existing work alone and simply compile a new supplement of perhaps one or two volumes; but then anyone looking for a word or sense and unsure of its age would have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> three different places. The most convenient choice for the user would have been for the entire dictionary to be re-edited and retypeset, with each change included in its proper alphabetical place; but this would have been the most expensive option, with perhaps 15 volumes required to be produced. The OUP chose a middle approach: combining the new material with the existing supplement to form a larger replacement supplement.|$|E

She also realizes that Gus was unaware of her death, leading to more confusion.|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Commonwealth {{soldiers}} billeted in Stevenage {{are reported}} to have stolen the bones. It was rumoured that the soldiers could be persuaded to part with the bones for a fee but supplemented the supply {{with the help of}} a local butcher. A letter to a local newspaper revealed that in 1917, a resident went into the barn <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the coffin and found horse bones. A nearby horse-riding school explained that copies of the will were still being sold and, if word got around that the coffin was empty, it could cause a drop in revenue. The coffin was temporarily removed in 1999 when the barn was refurbished. Some reports say that the coffin was found to be empty, though others state that the Letchworth undertakers who restored the coffin buried any remains. Trigg's plan had ultimately failed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning on Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at {{approximately}} 1:20a.m., Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle travelling along U.S. Highway 59, a white 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates. Lunsford pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and turned on his dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then got out of his cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal, his younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo Villarreal, and asked whether he had any ID on him, to which Villarreal replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not have it on him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27a.m., Lunsford asked <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> the trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana.|$|E

25|$|The mirror test allows {{scientists}} {{to determine whether}} birds are conscious of themselves and able to distinguish themselves from other animals by determining whether they possess or lack the ability to recognize themselves in their own reflections. European magpies are the only animals beside mammals that {{have been shown to}} be able to pass this test by trying to remove colored stickers from underneath their beaks when shown in a mirror. However, in 1981, Epstein, Lanza and Skinner published a paper in the journal Science in which they argued that pigeons also pass the mirror test. A pigeon was trained <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> a mirror to find a response key behind it which it then turned to peck‚Äîfood was the consequence of a correct choice (i.e., the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment). Next, the bird was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. This was done without a mirror. Then a small bib was placed on the pigeon‚Äîenough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror yielded no pecking at the dot. But when the mirror was shown, the pigeon became active, looked into it and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} European {{version of}} the music video for [...] "Trouble" [...] was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video footage was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. A Wild West-themed video, it features Martin as a prisoner in a dark warehouse, tied with ropes to a chair, being circled by cars in the freezing cold. The {{other members of the}} band are seen on the upper floor in a slow motion sequence where Buckland and Champion struggle with bass guitarist Guy Berryman, tying him to another chair and forcing him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> front. At this point, Martin's struggling causes his chair to tip over, and he hits the ground on his side. He sings the final line of the song ("They spun a web for me..."), before the darkness abruptly turns to daylight. [...] A beautiful sunrise is then revealed, but as the camera pans out, it is revealed to be fake and part of a large theater backdrop, with Martin still lying on his side, tied to the chair.|$|E
500|$|A {{survey in}} 1931 {{concluded}} that parts of Salford contained {{some of the}} worst slums in the country. Many houses were infested by rats and lacked elementary amenities. Inspectors found that of 950houses surveyed, 257were in a state of bad repair with leaking roofs, broken flooring and rotten woodwork. The inspectors were [...] "struck by the courage and perseverance with which the greater number of tenants kept their houses clean and respectable under most adverse conditions". By 1933 slum clearance projects were under way, {{and by the end of}} 1956 over a thousand families had been rehoused in overspill estates at Little Hulton. These clearances have, for some, changed the character of the area to such an extent that [...] "observers in search of the typical Salford may have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>in</b> Eccles and Swinton, for much of the community and townscape... has gone from Salford, replaced by tall blocks of flats". Large areas of the city were redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, with Victorian era terraced housing estates that inspired painter L. S. Lowry and soap opera Coronation Street giving way to concrete tower blocks and austere architecture. Life in Salford during the early 20th century was described by Robert Roberts, in his study The Classic Slum.|$|E
