5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> {{whether he}} is gay, Andy says he would reluctantly accept a kiss from movie star Brad Pitt.

Michael spreads a rumor that Oscar {{is the voice of}} the Taco Bell dog, a chihuahua used as an advertising character in the 1990s and 2000s for the restaurant chain Taco Bell. Michael also claims Angela is dating a billionaire who manages a Quiznos, a fast-food submarine sandwich restaurant. Michael starts a rumor that someone in the office is a J.Crew model, originally referring to himself, although everyone believes it to be Jim. J.Crew is an American clothing and accessories retailer.|$|E
5|$|Desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> a {{connection}} between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their profile information have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E

25|$|One change, {{which was}} later to {{become synonymous with}} the show, was the {{transformation}} of Diana Prince into Wonder Woman by spinning.

The monologue was released as a single in 1953 on the Colonial Records label, and was a hit for Griffith, reaching number nine on the charts in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Paul Schneider as Mark Brendanawicz, a {{city planner}} {{who entered the}} field {{with a sense of}} optimism, but has since become jaded and disillusioned. Schneider said early in the series he was {{insecure}} in the role because he was still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the character's motivations. Schneider left the cast after the second season and the character is not referenced at any point during the remainder of the show.|$|E

This became the beginning of a lifelong fascination.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, {{it occurred to him that}} integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to get it running.|$|E
25|$|Coke spent a {{considerable}} amount of time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> where it had made a mistake, ultimately concluding that it had underestimated the public reaction of the portion of the customer base that would be alienated by the switch. This would not emerge for several years afterward, however, and in the meantime the public simply concluded that the company had, as Keough suggested, failed to consider the public's attachment to the idea of what Coke's old formula represented. While that has become conventional wisdom in the ensuing years, some analyses have suggested otherwise.|$|E

25|$|On December 16, 2006, the Park Police {{pulled over}} Barry for driving too slowly, which Barry later said {{was because he}} was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> where to enter an {{elementary}} school's parking lot for a nonprofit foundation's event. After looking up Barry's record, the police officer told Barry that his license had been suspended and ticketed Barry for operating a vehicle on a suspended license, despite Barry's insistence to the contrary. Two days later, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Barry's license had not actually been suspended and said a computer glitch must have caused the error.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} tool {{in this effort}} was HUD's first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter {{at least once in}} a three-month period. Through the data collection for the report, and the subsequent analysis of that data, HUD learned {{a great deal about the}} demographics of homelessness. Prior to the report,according to Jackson, HUD had a hard time figuring out if national or local programs were working and a tough time just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> where the homeless might be on a given night.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what to {{do about}} K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E

25|$|With {{their current}} album {{suddenly}} withdrawn and their follow-up rejected, Badfinger spent {{the early months}} of 1975 <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to proceed under the unclear legal situation. Their March 1975 salary cheques did not clear, and the April cheques never arrived. Panic set in, especially for Ham, who had recently bought a £30,000 house in Woking, Surrey, and whose girlfriend was expecting a child. According to Jackson, the band tried to continue without Polley's involvement by contacting booking agents and prospective managers throughout London, but they were routinely declined because of their restrictive contracts with Polley and impending legal actions. Ham reportedly tried on many occasions to contact Polley by telephone during {{the early months of}} 1975, but was never able to reach him.|$|E
25|$|In California, the {{influence}} of Italian immigrants in {{the early history of}} the state's wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo (as well as other Italian grape varieties) steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine producing region of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim for producing higher quality wines, there has been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> which sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.|$|E
