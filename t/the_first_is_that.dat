5|$|A few {{deductions}} can be {{made from}} the satellite communications. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19 MYT—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying burst frequency offset (BFO) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it can also be deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
30|$|The two {{conclusions}} {{presented in}} the original paper still stand. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> long-term dietary exposure to genetically modified NK 603 maize is linked with statistically significant differences in blood parameters indicative of kidney deficiency and liver congestion/necrosis.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Paris Accord {{that ended}} the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at the outset, in that it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain their forces within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming the cease-fire.|$|R
25|$|Two other {{prominent}} murders occurred during his term. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> prefect {{of the monastery}} of Merced, killed by a priest of his order September 23, 1790. The other was the murder on June 25, 1792 of Lucas de Gálvez, governor and captain general of Yucatán.|$|R
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating electric charge is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|This cut-marked human bone {{assemblage}} {{represented the}} largest yet identified from within a Neolithic long barrow in southern Britain, although similar evidence for dismemberment {{has been found}} from other Neolithic British sites, such as West Trump, Eyford, Aldestrop, and Haddenham. There are two possibilities for how this material developed. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the bodies of the}} dead were excarnated or exposed to the elements, followed by a secondary burial within the tomb. The second is that they were placed in the tomb, where the flesh decomposed, before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself. These practices may have been accompanied by other ritualistic or ceremonial practices, direct evidence for which does not survive.|$|E
40|$|Several {{surveys have}} been carried out on the {{distribution}} of the major cations in insect haemolymph. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> by Bond (1944), who estimated the concentra-tions of sodium and potassium in twenty-seven species, drawn from eight orders and including five aquatic species. This was followed by the larger survey of Duchateau...|$|R
25|$|The OUP {{saw that}} it would take too long to {{complete}} the work with unrevised editorial arrangements. Accordingly, new assistants were hired and two new demands were made on Murray. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he move from Mill Hill to Oxford, which he did in 1885. Murray had his Scriptorium re-erected on his new property.|$|R
50|$|Houdini had two {{advantages}} over Walker's attempt. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Houdini <b>was</b> able to hide inside a cabinet {{away from the}} eyes of the public, Walker had to perform his attempt before an audience of 10000 people. The second advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Houdini had as much time as he wanted. Walker had a strict time limit.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. The second is that the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} used as {{offering}} tables were pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers and incense {{were given to the}} gods.|$|E
25|$|Two {{funerals}} {{were held}} in the East Room in <b>the</b> 1860s. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of 11-year-old Willie Lincoln, President Abraham Lincoln's son, who died of typhoid fever on February 21, 1862. Just over three years later, Lincoln's body lay in state in the East Room as well, and his funeral was held there on April 19.|$|R
2500|$|Arguments {{against the}} [...] "official narrative" [...] fell into two categories. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> no {{evidence}} for any black nationalist or communist involvement in the Hough Riots. [...] For example, Maj. Gen. Erwin C. Hostetler, Ohio National Guard Adjutant General, criticized Seltzer's conclusions, saying, [...] "There is absolutely nothing to substantiate his statement".|$|R
2500|$|Two {{critical}} editions have <b>been</b> published. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Moses Samuel Zuckermandl in 1882, which {{relied heavily}} on the Erfurt manuscript of the Tosefta. Zuckermandl's work has been characterized as [...] "a great step forward" [...] for its time. This edition was reprinted in 1970 by Rabbi Saul Lieberman, with additional notes and corrections.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{evolution}} of language must have created the problem of justification, which {{is the problem of}} explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{theories}} about the process that led Takenaga's unit to the decision to surrender. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all {{of the members of}} the unit were involved in the decision, and the second is that only the officers were involved.|$|E
25|$|Debate {{around the}} best method of tick removal is based around two main concerns. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the method of removal could cause further {{injection}} of noxious substances (allergens, paralysing toxins and infectious micro-organisms). The second is that the method may leave the 'head' (really just the tick's mouthparts) embedded in the skin.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> case <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we can {{impose the}} usual Dirichlet {{boundary}} value condition.|$|R
25|$|There {{were two}} reasons for this shift in {{preferred}} subject. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican. The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.|$|R
50|$|Elkins {{made two}} major, and controversial, {{arguments}} in Slavery. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> American abolitionists undercut their own effectiveness by their insistence on ideological consistency and purity, and their refusal to {{compromise with the}} slave system. Elkins contrasted them with British abolitionists who, he argued, were more pragmatic and therefore more politically effective; he noted that Britain had abolished slavery without war.|$|R
25|$|The {{complications}} of SEMS {{are related to}} a number of factors. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the endoscopic procedure used to insert a SEMS involves the use of sedative medications, which may lead to oversedation, aspiration, or drug reaction. SEMS also expand and can lead to perforation of the bowel or compression of structures adjacent to the bowel.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} {{hypothesis is}} best described using three principles. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many brain systems are activated by visual input, and the activations by these different inputs compete for processing access. Secondly, competition occurs in multiple brain systems and is integrated amongst these individual systems. Finally, competition {{can be assessed}} (using top-down neural priming) based on the relevant characteristics of the object at hand.|$|E
25|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward regarding the origin of Burlington's name. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was named after Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, {{and the second is}} that the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no Burling family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.|$|E
50|$|Cole could shuffle with {{models and}} engines {{the way it}} did for two reasons: <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> until 1915, <b>the</b> company refused to offer their cars on a yearly model change but relied on series <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{replaced}} when management felt the necessity for it. Many early cars were built this way, and Packard, for example, stayed with this system until late in the 1930s.|$|R
25|$|Three patients' {{deaths have}} been {{reported}} in gene therapy trials, putting the field under close scrutiny. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Jesse Gelsinger in 1999. Jesse Gelsinger was dead because of immune rejection response. One X-SCID patient died of leukemia in 2003. In 2007, a rheumatoid arthritis patient died from an infection; the subsequent investigation concluded <b>that</b> the death <b>was</b> not related to gene therapy.|$|R
50|$|In 1855, two {{separate}} main charges were brought against Hodson. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he had arbitrarily imprisoned a Yusufzai Pathan chief named Kader Khan, {{on suspicion of}} being involved in the murder of Colonel Mackeson. The man was acquitted, and Lord Dalhousie removed Hodson from his civil functions and remanded him to his regiment because of his lack of judgment and gross negligence.|$|R
25|$|Although it {{is common}} to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his {{principle}} can be expressed in three simple statements. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species has {{two main}} points to make. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{speciation}} {{is a genuine}} problem that must {{be explained by the}} theory of evolution. In nature, {{there is not a single}} population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point is that all the variations can be explained by the principles of genetics.|$|E
25|$|Leavis's {{criticism}} {{is difficult to}} directly classify, {{but it can be}} grouped into four chronological stages. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of his early publications and essays including New Bearings in English Poetry (1932) and Revaluation (1936). Here he was concerned primarily with reexamining poetry from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, and this was accomplished under the strong influence of T. S. Eliot. Also during this early period Leavis sketched out his views about university education.|$|E
5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan. He <b>was</b> told <b>that</b> the Fairy Flag had three magical properties. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it multiplied <b>the</b> number of men upon a battlefield. The second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when it <b>was</b> spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it brought herring into the loch.|$|R
25|$|Neural network {{research}} stagnated after {{machine learning}} research by Minsky and Papert (1969), who discovered two key {{issues with the}} computational machines that processed neural networks. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> basic perceptrons <b>were</b> incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second <b>was</b> <b>that</b> computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power.|$|R
25|$|Two {{rumors about}} finalist Katharine McPhee {{circulated}} during early March and throughout <b>the</b> season. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> quitting {{the show and}} would not {{show up for the}} March 7th airing. The second was sparked by the loose fitting blouses she had been wearing, leading viewers to suspect she was pregnant. Katharine denied both rumors when interviewed by host Ryan Seacrest on the March 7th show.|$|R
