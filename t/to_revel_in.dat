5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes <b>to</b> <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E

The Epicurean is portrayed here as someone who, in their despair, embraces the Arts in response to tragic ephemerality.

500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, {{a history professor at}} Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces <b>to</b> <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it filled my heart with gratitude and joy, to think that I had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the film}} three stars out of five, Empire writer Kim Newman stated that [...] "underneath an {{extremely}} repulsive concept, {{this is a}} relatively conventional horror movie."

[...] Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Clark Collis was broadly positive about Dieter Laser's performance as the Doctor, and praised Six's direction, saying Six [...] "has put together his nightmare yarn with Cronenbergian care and precision." [...] Collis said The Human Centipede was [...] "without question one of the most disgusting horror films ever made." [...] Writing in The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five, saying that whilst [...] "entirely deplorable and revolting" [...] the film was [...] "sort of brilliant". Total Film writer Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "Shocking, funny, disturbing... a throwback to the glory days of Cronenberg." ...|$|E

Larry Flick of Billboard magazine compared it to [...] "Wannabe" [...] saying that it [...] "is as immediately infectious, though it's not nearly as silly and novelty-driven". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a bid for street cred", while David Browne from the same magazine commented about the confusing lyrics, [...] "let's see: She wants to be friends, he wants more, and yet she croons, 'I'm giving you everything/All that joy can bring'? She's as confused as I am. Better <b>to</b> <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> the delectably frothy girl-group melody". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, {{in a review of}} their debut album Spice, said that [...] "what is surprising is how the sultry soul of 'Say You'll Be There' {{is more than just a}} guilty pleasure".

Time magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: [...] "His movie achieves what the best fairy tales do: {{the creation of an}} alternate world, plausible and persuasive, where the young— and not only the young— can lose themselves.

2500|$|In League, University and Army cricket Tyson {{had used}} a 'short' run up of 18 or 20 yards {{consisting}} of ten short steps and ten long final strides to the wicket. When he moved to first class cricket this increased to 38 yards, starting near the sightscreen and over 200 feet from the wicket-keeper, who was often reduced to an athletic long stop. With a final leap to the wicket he released the ball with a high arm action and a heave of his shoulders, 'the ferocity of his delivery' was described as 'every muscle is in use, the right foot takes the strain, the right arm is straight ready for delivery and the left leg kicks out menacingly'. Australian newspapers had accused Tyson of dragging his right foot over the popping crease on the 1954–55 tour and an English newspaper responded; [...] "Will Tyson be [...] "sacrificed" [...] to avoid any risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?" [...] with pictures of his bowling action. In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption reading [...] "Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!" [...] An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood {{to give his name}} to an article declaring [...] "Replay Tests – Tyson Not Fair". Unlike the great swing [...] bowler Fred Trueman he 'bowled straight and...never intentionally bowled an out-swinger. Instead Tyson relied on his tremendous pace to take most of his wickets, batsmen were often caught in mid-stroke by the speed of the ball coming onto the bat, or were too nervous to play fluently. On a green or crumbling wicket providing movement he could simply blast his way through the batting, and produced bounce and pace even off the placid Northamptonshire wickets. Tyson believed that a bouncer should 'pin the batsman against the sightscreen' and frequently used them to intimidate batsmen, even tailenders His ungainly action and quest for raw speed took a toll on even his strong body and he suffered from a series of injuries which brought a premature end to his career. In 1994 he had operations to his right arm and knees and a further operation on his knees in 2001 rendered him practically immobile for a short time. As he put it himself [...] "to bowl fast is <b>to</b> <b>revel</b> <b>in</b> the glad animal action, to thrill in physical power and to enjoy a sneaking feeling of superiority over the mortals who play the game". However, he was no simple bowler, but thought hard how to dismiss and deceive batsman. John Arlott wrote [...] "This was intelligence, rhythm and strength merged into the violent craft of fast bowling" [...] and [...] "He is intelligent beyond the usual run of fast bowlers: he is the type of cricketer whom improves rapidly through thinking about the game".|$|E
