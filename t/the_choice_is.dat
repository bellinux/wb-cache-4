5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> a matter of convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), {{which is on the}} equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; the (collapsed) rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E
5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E
5|$|The {{rule that}} at most half the contestants win a medal is {{sometimes}} broken {{if it would}} cause {{the total number of}} medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%) of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea — see below) a medal), 2012 (when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to give either 226 (46.35%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>was</b> to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal.|$|R

5|$|In the Middle Ages {{there was}} {{considerable}} variation in the nomination of the archbishop and other bishops. At various times the choice {{was made by the}} canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the king of England, or the Pope. Since the Reformation, the church is explicitly a state church and <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> legally that of the British crown; today it is made {{in the name of the}} monarch by the Prime Minister, from a shortlist of two selected by an ad hoc committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.|$|E
5|$|The play also {{features}} an ambiguous and multifaceted portrayal of scientific knowledge, celebrating it for its humanistic achievements and discoveries, but also warning {{that it can}} do immense harm when {{in the hands of}} the unethical or overambitious. Given these themes, the play is likely Verne's most purely science-fictional work. Structurally, the play evokes the three-part design of Jacques Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which the hero must choose between love and art. In Journey Through the Impossible, however, <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> between positive ideals—love, goodness, happiness—and the unbounded scientific ambitions of the sinister Doctor Ox.|$|E

25|$|Socioemotional Selectivity Theory also depicts {{how people}} {{maintain}} continuity in old age.

25|$|Toilet paper {{when used}} with a toilet roll holder with a {{horizontal}} axle {{parallel to the floor}} and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the toilet paper may hang over (in front of) or under (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by habit.

25|$|Residences for {{students}} are Bocconi Residence, Javotte Residence, Kramer Residence, the more modern Arcobaleno Residence, Spadolini Residence {{and the latest}} Dubini Residence (inaugurated in 2010).

25|$|Many {{languages}} with ergative marking display what {{is known}} as optional ergativity, where the ergative marking is not always expressed in all situations. McGregor (2010) gives a range of contexts when we often see optional ergativity, and argues that <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> often not truly optional but is affected by semantics and pragmatics. Note that unlike split ergativity, which occurs regularly but in limited locations, optional ergativity can occur in a range of environments, but may not be used in a way that appears regular or consistent.|$|E
25|$|Brewers {{have the}} option of using a liquid (LME) or dry (DME) form of it. Each has its pros and cons, so <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> {{dependent}} solely on the individual brewer's preferences. Some brewers choose to work only with LME, because they feel it works best for the result they wish to achieve. Also, it requires one fewer processing step, so it is appealing to those favoring the purest form of product available. However, it is very sticky and, therefore, messier to work with and has a shorter shelf life, and some feel the results are just as good with DME.|$|E

25|$|When {{the parties}} express a clear {{intention}} in a choice-of-law clause, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption {{that this is the}} proper law because it reflects the parties' freedom of contract and it produces certainty of outcome. It can only be rebutted when <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not bona fide, it produces illegality, or it breaches public policy. For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise mandatory provisions of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties are not free to put themselves above the law and, in such cases, it will be for the parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E
25|$|In the {{multiplayer}} modes 'Survival of the Fittest', 'Civil War', and 'Turf War', a Big Daddy suit will spawn at {{a random}} {{location in the}} level. <b>The</b> <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> given to the player who finds this suit to become the Big Daddy, which will give the player greater strength and endurance but prohibits the use of plasmids and hacking, as well as expelling any previously held damage bonuses against other players. The Big Daddy can stomp, shoot a rivet gun, melee attack, and throw proximity mines. All damage dealt to the Big Daddy is permanent, and cannot be replenished. Once the Big Daddy is defeated, the suit disappears and spawns in another location on the map two minutes later. In 'Capture the Sister' {{one member of the}} defending team is chosen at random to be the Big Daddy; after the player's death, the Big Daddy suit disappears {{for the rest of the}} round.|$|E
