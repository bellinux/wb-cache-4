5|$|Supporting Imperial War Museum North's {{educational}} goals, {{the museum}} has operated a volunteer programme since opening in 2002. The programme seeks to engage local people at risk of social exclusion. Originally based on a National Vocational Qualification, the programme was revised and relaunched in 2004, and consisted of a basic cultural heritage course, providing opportunities to develop academic skills and improve confidence, and to support individuals seeking to return to employment. In return volunteers work in the museum's public spaces {{as part of the}} front of house teams. In January 2007 the museum launched the in Touch volunteer programme, in partnership with Manchester Museum and supported by £425,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The programme was recognised by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport as a case study of its kind, in the department's <b>Third</b> <b>Sector</b> Strategy.|$|E
5|$|The top ten drivers {{competed for}} pole {{position}} in Q3 {{and it was}} a battle between the two Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton set his fastest time first with Rosberg right behind him. A much better time in the <b>third</b> <b>sector</b> of the track allowed Rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four-tenths ahead of his teammate. Sergio Pérez held third spot for much of the session but was beaten to it by Kimi Räikkönen during the second turn of runs. The two were followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas on the third row of the grid. Following a gearbox change after qualifying, Romain Grosjean was demoted five places on the grid. Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens also received five place penalties: Stevens for a change of the Control Electronics unit, Merhi for changes made to his suspension. Both would start the race from the back row of the grid.|$|E

25|$|Also in 2003 a {{large portion}} of work was focused on the {{division}} of Chocola into three different sectors. The first at {{the north side of the}} city containing large, low and grouped platforms, water directing systems, river cobble structures and possibly served as a place of residence for the upper class. The second being in the center of the site with large mounds (in a pyramidal form) which may have served a purpose as an area of administration and public ceremonies. The <b>third</b> <b>sector,</b> lying at the southern part of the site contained similar findings to that of the north except the architecture of houses and workshops had less complicated architecture and contained signs of intensive agriculture, and therefore probably served as a residential area for the common people. But even with this information not much research has been done on the site and only about 5.5x2km has been excavated up to this point.|$|E
