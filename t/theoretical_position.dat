25|$|Giddens {{was born}} and raised in Edmonton, London, and grew up in a lower-middle-class family, son of a clerk with London Transport; he {{attended}} Minchenden School. He was the first member of his family to go to university. Giddens received his undergraduate academic degree (in joint sociology and psychology) at the University of Hull in 1959, followed by a master's degree at the London School of Economics. He later gained a PhD at King's College, Cambridge. In 1961, he started working at the University of Leicester where he taught social psychology. At Leicester — considered to be one of the seedbeds of British sociology — he met Norbert Elias and began to work on his own <b>theoretical</b> <b>position.</b> In 1969, he was appointed to a position at the University of Cambridge, where he later helped create the Social and Political Sciences Committee (SPS — now HSPS), a sub-unit of the Faculty of Economics.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the history}} of {{economic}} thought, Georgescu-Roegen was the first economist of some standing to theorise {{on the premise that}} all of Earth's mineral resources will eventually be exhausted at some point. [...] In his paradigmatic magnum opus, Georgescu-Roegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the carrying capacity of Earth—that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels—is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself. Due to the radical pessimism inherent in his work, based on the physical concept of entropy, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>position</b> of Georgescu-Roegen and his followers was later termed 'entropy pessimism'.|$|E
2500|$|Yale's English and Comparative Literature {{departments}} {{were part}} of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called [...] "Yale School". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J.Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose <b>theoretical</b> <b>position</b> was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C.Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory {{in the latter half of}} the 20thcentury. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.|$|E
40|$|In {{citizenship}} education, tensions {{exist between}} pedagogical goals and students’ perspectives. This article investigates the discrepancies and commonalities between the <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> and young people’s lived citizenship, especially concerning their conceptual and social foundations. Two <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> on democratic citizenship development and one Dutch student’s {{sense of his}} civic self are compared. Our findings indicate that the <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> are less suitable to detect and appreciate more subtle ways in which young people already do contribute to democracy in their everyday lives. Secondly, they indicate that democratic citizenship education needs to attend more to students’ perceptions of a need to contribute and to develop their citizenship identities. Two complementary approaches are suggested: investigating more subtle ways in which students already do contribute, and raising student’s awareness of democratic deficits...|$|R

A cognitive sociological approach to analyzing the positions within this debate allows theorists and researchers {{to be aware of}} three distinct <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> or thought communities: natural kinds thought community, social kinds thought community, and empty kinds thought community. Standard content analysis and grounded theory methods are used to analyze the principles, strategies, and practices each thought community uses to mark group membership into various sexual categories. The analysis reveals that each theoretical perspective is marking group membership differently...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Ternus effect {{involves}} a multi-element stimulus {{that can lead}} to either of two different percepts of apparent movement depending upon a variety of stimulus conditions. Since Ternus's 1926 discussion of this phenomenon, many researchers have attempted to explain it. We examine the history of explanations of the Ternus effect and show that they have evolved to contemporary <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> that are very similar to Ternus's own ideas. Additionally, we describe a new experiment showing that <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> that emphasize element grouping and element identity within groups can predict the effects of certain stimulus manipulations on the Ternus effect. 1 Introduction an...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> in {{psychology}} [...] including variants of case-based reasoning, instance-based analogy, and connectionist models [...] maintain that abstract rules {{are not involved}} in human reasoning, or at best play a minor role. Other views hold that the use of abstract rules is a core aspect of human reasoning. We propose eight criteria for determining whether or not people use abstract rules in reasoning, and examine evidence relevant to each criterion for several rule systems. We argue that there is substantial evidence that several different inferential rules, including modus ponens, contractual rules, causal rules, and the law of large numbers, are used in solving everyday problems. We discuss the implications for various <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> and consider hybrid mechanisms that combine aspects of instance and rule models...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{explores the}} {{antagonism}} expressed by two different <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> within medical anthropology towards the structural violence position: the culture as central approach and the post-structuralist approach. While medical anthro-pologists trained in cultural models of illness are {{disappointed by the}} lack of culture in the structural violence approach, medical anthropologists trained in post-struc-turalist models of illness take issue with what they perceive to be its moral and uni-versalist claims. In order to explore these universalist claims, the author returns to the field of moral psychology and its understanding of universal morality by exploring the history of the Heinz dilemma. She then frames her own recent research on global pharmaceutical politics in Argentina and Mexico {{in the context of the}} Heinz dilemma, neo-liberal discourses of capitalism, and the <b>theoretical</b> <b>positions</b> available within medical anthropology...|$|R
