5|$|The {{situation}} {{became quite}} tense {{with each of}} the sides making <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> refusing to meet with each other. Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto-Novo would join with Nigeria. Ethnic tensions increased with these <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories. Many inside the country considered Dahomey to be close to civil war.|$|E

25|$|Fear {{and anxiety}} can be {{differentiated}} in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the <b>threat,</b> <b>and</b> (4) motivated direction. Fear {{is defined as}} short lived, present focused, geared towards a specific <b>threat,</b> <b>and</b> facilitating escape from threat; anxiety, on the other hand, is defined as long-acting, future focused, broadly focused towards a diffuse <b>threat,</b> <b>and</b> promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> interferes with constructive coping.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to get a deeper {{understanding}} of staff who are exposed to <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence in the work with people with mental disabilities. Focus is aimed at the staff´s experience of that in their daily work can be exposed to <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence. The first question for the study is what definition the staff gives to <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence in the daily work with people with mental disabilities and the second one is what determines the decision in making/or not making a report in <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence in the daily work with people with mental disorders. To collect empirical data the study is based on seven individual semistructured interviews with staff working with people with mental disabilities. The theory used to analyse is the normalisationprocess. The analyse is based on the interview-participants views on how they define <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence, their view on the client and themselves <b>and</b> also reporting <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence. The result is that the staff is affected by different aspects and a conflict is made between context and individual. This conflict contributes to the decision in reporting <b>and</b> definition of <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> violence...|$|R
40|$|The brain {{mechanisms}} underlying anxiety/stress {{and motivation}} {{have been investigated}} extensively. However, they were mainly investigated independently of each other. Even though some studies discussed interactions between these two mechanisms, {{our understanding of the}} interaction between anxiety/stress and motivation is still limited. Motivation can be divided into two aspects. One is appetitive motivation to win appetitive outcome, and the other is aversive motivation for avoiding aversive outcome. Accordingly, in current functional MRI study, it was investigated how appetitive/aversive motivational processing would be influenced by anxiety/stress. In the first experiment I investigated interactions between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> reward processing during anticipation of electric shock and monetary reward. Analysis of skin conductance data during a delay phase revealed competitive interaction between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> reward processing. Analysis of imaging data during a delay phase also revealed the interaction effect in several regions, including midbrain/ventral tegmental area, caudate, putamen, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, anterior insula, middle frontal gyrus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. In the second experiment, the interaction between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> reward/punishment processing was investigated. Analysis of imaging data during a delay phase revealed competitive interaction between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> reward processing in left caudate. However, responses in the same site did show interaction between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> punishment processing. Taken together, the findings in two studies suggest competitive processes of <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> reward, and independent processes of <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> punishment...|$|R

5|$|Amid the enquiry, Thompson and Maguire {{received}} {{a number of}} <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> had to tolerate other more minor vexations. Maguire, unaccustomed to the African bush as he was, brought a number of accusations on himself through his personal habits. One day he happened to clean his false teeth in what the Matabele considered a sacred spring and accidentally dropped some eau de Cologne into it; the angry locals interpreted this as him deliberately poisoning the spring. They also alleged that Maguire partook of witchcraft and spent his nights riding around the bush on a hyena.|$|E
5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century.|$|E
5|$|Depression Quest {{was praised}} by critics for its {{portrayal}} {{of depression and}} its educational value. The game was noted for diverging from mainstream uses of video games as a medium. Popular reception was more mixed, and Quinn received <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> harassment from people who disapproved of the game. False allegations that the game had received a positive review from a journalist {{in a relationship with}} Quinn triggered the Gamergate controversy.|$|E

40|$|Attending to stimuli {{that share}} perceptual {{similarity}} to learned threats is an adaptive strategy. However, prolonged threat generalization to cues signalling safety {{is considered a}} core feature of pathological anxiety. One potential factor that may sustain over-generalization is sensitivity to future threat uncertainty. To assess {{the extent to which}} Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) predicts threat generalization, we recorded skin conductance in 54 healthy participants during an associative learning paradigm, where <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> safety cues varied in perceptual similarity. Lower IU was associated with stronger discrimination between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> safety cues during acquisition and extinction. Higher IU, however, was associated with generalized responding to <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> safety cues during acquisition, and delayed discrimination between <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> safety cues during extinction. These results were specific to IU, over and above other measures of anxious disposition. These findings highlight: (1) a critical role of uncertainty-based mechanisms in <b>threat</b> generalization, <b>and</b> (2) IU as a potential risk factor for anxiety disorder development...|$|R
5|$|Enemies & Allies is a 2009 {{novel by}} American science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson. The book {{is set in}} the 1950s, {{in the midst of the}} Cold War, and follows Superman and Batman. Though {{suspicious}} of each other, they confront Lex Luthor who stages an international nuclear conflict and spreads fear of an alien invasion so that he can sell advanced weapons to governments. Themes used in the novel, reflective of the 1950s era, include alien invasion films, nuclear <b>threats,</b> <b>and</b> Cold War paranoia.|$|E
5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> throffers {{affect the}} {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player; the guards will fight alongside the player, and both guards and scientists can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information. A wide array of alien enemies populate the game, including headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies, and Vortigaunts. The player also faces human opponents, in particular, Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> silence all witnesses.|$|E

This event, Akhtar's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics, such as James Joyner, claiming that western nations and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims' claims or <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> by commentators, including author Daniel C. Dennett, highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision. The main eyes, in the front-and-center position, are large, and {{are more}} acute than those of a cat and about 10 times as acute as a dragonfly's. The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, for avoiding <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Metzen {{announced}} in early 2005 {{that he was}} working on a graphic novel series independent of Blizzard Entertainment. The series, entitled Soldier: 76, is set in a second American civil war in 2010, with increased domestic and global terror <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> the increase in power for the US federal government over that of local state governments serving as a background. Metzen wrote the series' script, while Brazilian artist Max Velati was responsible for the illustration and painting of the book. Soldier: 76 would later appear as a character in Overwatch, Blizzard's online first-person shooter game, released in May 2016.|$|E

5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> promises to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E
