50|$|The {{constitution}} of <b>the</b> late <b>Roman</b> <b>Empire</b> was an unwritten {{set of guidelines}} and principles passed down mainly through precedent which defined {{the manner in which}} <b>the</b> late <b>Roman</b> <b>Empire</b> was governed.

5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Roman</b> <b>Empire's</b> ability {{to intervene in}} the fall of <b>the</b> Western <b>Roman</b> <b>Empire,</b> which happened in early September 476.
