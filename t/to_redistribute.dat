5|$|In his 1892 work La planète Mars et ses {{conditions}} d'habitabilité, Camille Flammarion {{wrote about}} how these channels resembled man-made canals, which an intelligent race could use <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> water across a dying Martian world. He advocated {{for the existence of}} such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more advanced than humans.|$|E

High potassium levels can be life-threatening, {{and respond to}} increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). Temporary measures include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, insulin or salbutamol <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E

5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Cuba and Venezuela {{were the}} {{founding}} {{members of the}} Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). ALBA sought <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> wealth evenly throughout member countries, to protect the region's agriculture, and to oppose economic liberalization and privatization. ALBA's origins lay in a December 2004 agreement signed between the two countries, and was formalized through a People's Trade Agreement also signed by Evo Morales' Bolivia in April 2006. Castro had also been calling for greater Caribbean integration since the late 1990s, saying that only strengthened cooperation between Caribbean countries would prevent their domination by rich nations in a global economy. Cuba has opened four additional embassies in the Caribbean Community including: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Suriname, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This development makes Cuba the only country to have embassies in all independent countries of the Caribbean Community.|$|E

5|$|Following its brief {{theatrical}} run, Universal Studios quickly {{sold the}} film's rights to cable companies, allowing Tender Mercies {{to be shown}} on television. When the film unexpectedly received five Academy Award nominations nearly a year after its original release, the studio attempted <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> the film to theaters; however, the cable companies began televising the film about {{a week before the}} Oscar ceremony, which essentially halted any attempts at a theatrical rerelease. When the film first played on HBO in March 1984, it surpassed the three major networks in ratings for homes with cable televisions. Tender Mercies was released on VHS some time later, and was first released on DVD on June 22, 1999.|$|E
5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was the currency reform of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency. In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited the currency reform <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E

50|$|In a {{perfectly}} equal world, no resources would need <b>to</b> be <b>redistributed</b> <b>to</b> achieve equal distribution: a Hoover index of 0. In {{a world in}} which all income was received by just one family, almost 100% of that income would need <b>to</b> be <b>redistributed</b> (i.e., taken and given to other families) in order to achieve equality. The Hoover index then ranges between 0 and 1 (0% and 100%), where 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 (100%) indicates maximum inequality.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E
5|$|Ireland was {{important}} to Henry, both {{as a source of}} royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters. The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England. The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> Irish lands to his supporters. In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the native Irish; the local Irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region. These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period. In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no record}} of Goya's {{thoughts}} during this period. He completed the series during a period recuperating from illness, possibly lead poisoning, {{when he was in}} considerable mental and physical pain, and withdrew from public life. Witches' Sabbath is believed to be a rather bitter, but silent, protest against the royalists and clergy who had retaken control of Spain after the Peninsular War of 1807–14. Advocates of the Enlightenment had sought <b>to</b> <b>redistribute</b> land to the peasants, to educate women, publish a vernacular Bible and, by replacing superstition with reason, {{put an end to the}} Inquisition. Witch hunting, seen during the Logroño Inquisition, was an appalling regression to liberals such as Goya. As court painter Goya was a part of the established order; surviving evidence indicates he was acquiesced to the wishes of his patrons. Yet numerous paintings and etchings have emerged since, suggesting he had convictions favouring liberalism, enlightenment, and reason. He seems to have kept such beliefs private, only expressing them in his private art; his more sensitive works were not published at the time, probably for fear of reprisal or persecution. In Witches' Sabbath Goya mocks and ridicules the superstition, fear and irrationality of the ignorant placing their faith in ghouls, quack doctors and tyrants.|$|E
