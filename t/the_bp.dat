5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When <b>the</b> <b>BP</b> gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for <b>the</b> <b>BP</b> counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E

40|$|By {{introduction}} of recombinant plasmids into monkey CV 1 cells, we have unambiguously demonstrated that sequences entirely within <b>the</b> 72 <b>bp</b> repeat, {{which is located}} upstream of the SV 40 early region, are crucial for T-antigen expression in vivo. We have also shown that a DNA fragment containing <b>the</b> 72 <b>bp</b> repeat, inserted directly before chicken conalbumin or adenovirus- 2 major late promoter sequences in chimeric plasmids where these promoters replace that of the SV 40 early genes, caused {{a dramatic increase in}} the expression of T-antigen in vivo.

40|$|This {{population}} {{study included}} 399 subjects, of whom 370 (93 %) {{showed a significant}} diurnal blood pressure (<b>BP)</b> rhythm. <b>The</b> nocturnal <b>BP</b> fall was normally distributed and averaged 16 +/- 9 mm Hg systolic and 14 +/- 7 mm Hg diastolic (mean +/- SD). The amplitude of <b>the</b> diurnal <b>BP</b> curve followed a positively skewed distribution, {{with a mean of}} 16 +/- 5 mm Hg for systolic BP and 14 +/- 4 mm Hg for diastolic <b>BP.</b> <b>The</b> daily <b>BP</b> maximum occurred at 15 : 54 +/- 4 : 47 for systolic BP and at 15 : 11 +/- 4 : 20 for diastolic BP. Thirty-four subjects were reexamined after a median interval of 350 days. The test for the presence of a significant diurnal rhythm was discordant in only two subjects. Repeatability (twice the standard deviation of the differences between paired recordings expressed {{as a percentage of the}} mean) varied from 11 to 25 % for the 24 h, daytime, and overnight BP, and from 76 to 138 % for the parameters describing <b>the</b> diurnal <b>BP</b> rhythm. In nine subjects with an initial night/day ratio of mean BP less than 0. 78, <b>the</b> nighttime <b>BP</b> was significantly increased at the repeat examination, whereas the opposite tendency was observed in nine subjects with an initial ratio greater than 0. 87. In conclusion, the distribution of <b>the</b> nocturnal <b>BP</b> fall is unimodal.

40|$|Abstract NKX 3. 1 is an androgen-regulated prostate-specific {{homeobox}} gene that {{is thought to}} play an important role in prostate development and cancerogenesis. NKX 3. 1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene specifically in the prostate. Up-regulation of NKX 3. 1 gene offers a promising gene therapy for prostate cancer. The decoy strategy has been developed and is considered a useful tool for regulating gene expression and gene therapy. In our previous studies, we identified a 20 bp inhibitory element upstream of the NKX 3. 1 promoter. In this study, we focused on using <b>the</b> 20 <b>bp</b> inhibitory element decoy to block negative regulation of the NKX 3. 1 gene and to up-regulate NKX 3. 1 expression using synthetic double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides of <b>the</b> 20 <b>bp</b> inhibitory element. We found in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiment that <b>the</b> 20 <b>bp</b> inhibitory decoy presented competitive binding to a specific binding protein of <b>the</b> 20 <b>bp</b> inhibitory element in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. In luciferase reporter gene assays, we found that <b>the</b> 20 <b>bp</b> inhibitory decoy could enhance NKX 3. 1 promoter activity, and RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that NKX 3. 1 expression was up-regulated effectively by the transfection with <b>the</b> 20 <b>bp</b> inhibitory decoy.
