The sculpture stands over forty feet tall and is enclosed with a wrought iron fence forty feet by fifty feet.The sculpture is composed of twenty tons of steel (plate, channels and I-beams), two tons of polypropylene rope (the <b>tail),</b> <b>fiber</b> glass (the bowties), a ton of cedar (the handle), assorted bearings (for the wheels and mouth mechanism,) television sets (the eyes,) industrial epoxy paints and the various electrical components which power the piece. The sculpture is set on four concrete foundations and surrounded by a wrought iron fence five feet tall. The top of the fence is lined with double entrendres of political cliches. The Mayor of Cleveland, Michael R. White, opposed the erection of the sculpture for purely aesthetic reasons ("I 've seen it and I don't like it...." [...] The Plain Dealer, Feb. 19, 1994.) This opposition created difficulty in obtaining the required building permits from the City's Building Department.

Comparative studies suggested that K encodes the <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> protein and that orf 45 encodes an assembly protein. K protein contains a succession of short amino acid sequences (motifs) that are homologous with sequences from the <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> proteins of unrelated bacteriophages. The fact that these sequence motifs are variously present in the <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> proteins of unrelated bacteriophages has been advanced as evidence for horizontal transfer {{in the evolution of}} the associated <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> genes.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the DNA {{sequence of the}} bacteriophage P 2 tail genes G and H, which code for polypeptides of 175 and 669 residues, respectively. Gene H probably codes for the distal part of the P 2 <b>tail</b> <b>fiber,</b> since the deduced sequence of its product contains regions similar to <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> proteins from phages Mu, P 1, lambda, K 3, and T 2. The similarities of the carboxy-terminal portions of the P 2, Mu, ann P 1 <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> proteins may explain the observation that these phages in general have the same host range. The P 2 H gene product {{is similar to the}} products of both lambda open reading frame (ORF) 401 (stf, side <b>tail</b> <b>fiber)</b> and its downstream ORF, ORF 314. If 1 bp is inserted near the end of ORF 401, this reading frame becomes fused with ORF 314, creating an ORF that may represent the complete stf gene that encodes a 774 -amino-acid-long side <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> protein. Thus, a frameshift mutation seems to be present in the common laboratory strain of lambda. Gene G of P 2 probably codes for a protein required for assembly of the tail fibers of the virion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The T 4 {{bacteriophage}} {{consists of}} a head, filled with double-stranded DNA, and a complex contractile tail required for the ejection of the viral genome into the Escherichia coli host. The tail has a baseplate to whïch are attached six long and six short <b>tail</b> <b>fibers.</b> These fibers are the sensing devices for recognizing the host. When activated by attachment to cell receptors, the fibers cause a conformational transition in the baseplate and subsequently in the tail sheath, which initiates DNA ejection. The baseplate is a multisubunit complex of proteins encoded by 15 genes. Gene product 9 (gp 9) is the protein that connects the long <b>tail</b> <b>fibers</b> to the baseplate and triggers the tail contraction after virus attachment to a host cell. RESULTS: The crystal structure of recombinant gp 9, determined to 2. 3 A resolution, shows that the protein of 288 amino acid residues assembles as a homotrimer. The monomer consists of three domains: the N-terminal domain generates a triple coiled coil; the middle domain is a mixed, seven-stranded beta sandwich with a topology not previously observed; and the C-terminal domain is an eight-stranded, antiparallel beta sandwich having some resemblance to 'jelly-roll' viral capsid protein structures. CONCLUSIONS: The biologically active form of gp 9 is a trimer. The protein contains flexible interdomain hinges, which are presumably required to facilitate signal transmission between the long <b>tail</b> <b>fibers</b> and the baseplate. Structural and genetic analyses show that the C-terminal domain is bound to the baseplate, and the N-terminal coiled-coil domain {{is associated with the}} long <b>tail</b> <b>fibers.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|My Ph. D. {{research}} involved {{studying the}} process of infection of Escherichia coli bacteria by bacteriophage T 4. Bacteriophage T 4 is a large, double-stranded DNA, tailed virus belonging to the Myoviridae subfamily. The bacteriophage T 4 tail is composed of two concentric cylinders: the inner rigid tail tube and the outer contractile tail sheath. One end of the tail {{is associated with the}} unique portal vertex of the head capsid, whereas the other end is terminated with a baseplate to which the fibers are attached. The baseplate and fibers are responsible for host cell recognition and attachment of the phage to the cell surface. Upon interaction of the fibers with the lipopolysaccharides on the cell surface, the baseplate changes its conformation from hexagonal to star-shaped triggering tail sheath contraction. The contracting tail sheath drives the tail tube through the cell envelope bringing the tube into contact with the inner cell membrane, which initiates release of the phage DNA into the host. ^ Structure of the bacteriophage T 4 baseplate has been investigated using electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography of the component proteins. The crystal structures of six baseplate proteins, four of which are reported in this work, were fitted into a 12 Å resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the baseplate in the hexagonal conformation. A 17 Å resolution reconstruction of the star-shaped baseplate was also obtained and interpreted in terms of the component proteins. ^ The baseplate appeared to be stabilized in the hexagonal conformation by the six short <b>tail</b> <b>fibers,</b> which are folded under the baseplate in a garland-like arrangement {{with the help of the}} short tail fiber-attachment protein, gene product (gp) 11. In the star conformation, gp 11 was found to dissociate from the short <b>tail</b> <b>fibers</b> and bind to the long <b>tail</b> <b>fibers.</b> Upon binding to the cell surface receptors, the carboxy terminal, receptor-binding domains of the short <b>tail</b> <b>fibers</b> become free and disengage from the garland, thus unlocking the baseplate structure. The long <b>tail</b> <b>fibers</b> associate with gp 11 and switch the baseplate to the star conformation, which initiates tail sheath contraction. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{bacteriophage}} lambda initially binds to liposomes bearing its receptor protein by the tip of the <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> (type 1 complex).

Another bacteriophage protein, pH, is sensitive to proteolytic degradation in free bacteriophage, type 1 complexes, or type 2 complexes formed with free receptor, but is resistant to proteinases in type 2 complexes formed with liposomes.

40|$|The {{first step}} in {{bacteriophage}} infection is recognition and binding to the host receptor, which is mediated by the phage receptor binding protein (RBP). Different RBPs can lead to differential host specificity. In many bacteriophages, such as Escherichia coli and Lactococcal phages, RBPs {{have been identified as}} the <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> or protruding baseplate proteins. However, the tail fiber-dependent host specificity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages has not been well studied. This study aimed to identify and investigate the binding specificity of the RBP of P. aeruginosa phages PaP 1 and JG 004. These two phages share high DNA sequence homology but exhibit different host specificities. A spontaneous mutant phage was isolated and exhibited broader host range compared with the parental phage JG 004. Sequencing of its putative <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> and baseplate region indicated a single point mutation in ORF 84 (a putative <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> gene), which resulted in the replacement of a positively charged lysine (K) by an uncharged asparagine (N). We further demonstrated that the replacement of the <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> gene (ORF 69) of PaP 1 with the corresponding gene from phage JG 004 resulted in a recombinant phage that displayed altered host specificity.

40|$|Plasmid p 15 B and {{the genome}} of {{bacteriophage}} P 1 are closely related, but their site-specific DNA inversion systems, Min and Cin, respectively, {{do not have}} strict structural homology.

The substituting sequences of both the min recombinase gene and the multiple invertible DNA segments of p 15 B are, respectively, homologous to the pin recombinase gene and to part of the invertible DNA of the Pin system on the defective viral element e 14 of Escherichia coli K- 12. To map the sites of this substitution, the DNA sequence of a segment adjacent to the invertible segment in the P 1 genome was determined. This, together with already available sequence data, indicated that both P 1 and p 15 B had suffered various sequence acquisitions or deletions and sequence amplifications giving rise to mosaics of partially related repeated elements. Data base searches revealed segments of homology in the DNA inversion regions of p 15 B, e 14, and P 1 and in <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> genes of phages Mu, T 4, P 2, and lambda.

Tail assembly: After the baseplate (80 S) is completed, the core forms on the baseplate. The functions of genes 19, 48, and 54 are required for this conversion. The gene 18 product, a major sheath structural subunit, polymerizes on the core-baseplate (80 S) and then the 3 and 15 gene products fix the sheath subunits in the polymerized form, yielding a sheathed tail (130 S). <b>Tail</b> <b>fiber</b> assembly: The <b>tail</b> <b>fiber</b> (10 S) is made up of 8 S and 9 S components.
