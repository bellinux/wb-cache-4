5|$|Upon release, Saw {{received}} mixed reviews. It {{was praised}} for the storyline and multiple endings, {{as well as}} the immersive environment <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> to the Saw film series. The controls and combat system, however, were panned by critics. Since Konami purchased the publishing rights after former publisher Brash Entertainment went bankrupt, Konami had a significant input on the games' final outcome. They stated that they had plans to make Saw their next big franchise as well as a spiritual successor to their other survival horror series, Silent Hill. A sequel, , was released on multiple platforms on October 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II. They decided {{to avoid the}} expense of travel and {{bringing}} supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles (13km) northeast of Dayton. They received {{permission to use the}} field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.|$|E

These chips usually include SPI controllers capable of running in either master or slave mode. In-system programmable AVR controllers (including blank ones) can be programmed using a SPI interface.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a formal theorem is {{fundamentally}} syntactic, {{in contrast to the}} notion of a true proposition, which introduces semantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. belief, justification or other modalities). The soundness of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities. A validity is a formula <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are tautologies. A formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its tautologies are also theorems.|$|E

NCM and CM {{have been known to}} be discussed in conjunction with one another being as they are functionally similar.

25|$|Tradition {{holds that}} {{following}} the Roman departure, Roman customs held {{on into the}} 5th century in southern Wales, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in part. Caerwent continued to be occupied, while Carmarthen was probably abandoned in the late 4th century. In addition, southwestern Wales was the tribal territory of the Demetae, who had never become thoroughly Romanised. An influx of settlers from southeastern Ireland {{had taken place in}} the late 4th century, both in northern Wales and in the entire region of southernmost and southwestern Wales under circumstances that are still poorly understood, and it seems far-fetched to suggest that they were ever Romanised.|$|E

At its best, we hope our involvement may bolster the spirit of positive engagement and creativity in Detroit, catalyzing others to invest strategically across the region. It does not mark the start of philanthropy as a solution to public insolvency. This is a unique, clear-eyed move to push forward positive negotiations, with our philanthropic dollars being exclusively pegged for two roles: safeguarding the DIA and protecting pensions.|$|E
25|$|Gödel's incompleteness theorems (Gödel 1931) {{establish}} additional {{limits on}} first-order axiomatizations. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any consistent, effectively given (defined below) logical {{system that is}} capable of interpreting arithmetic, there exists a statement <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> (in the sense that it holds for the natural numbers) but not provable within that logical system (and which indeed may fail in some non-standard models of arithmetic which may be consistent with the logical system). For example, in every logical system capable of expressing the Peano axioms, the Gödel sentence holds for the natural numbers but cannot be proved.|$|E

Current students assert with pride that Harvard College, founded a year later in 1636, was created for Boston Latin's first graduates to attend and continue their education. Whether or not <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> Boston Latin has been a top feeder school for Harvard, and has consistently sent large numbers of its graduates to Harvard, recently averaging about twenty-five students per year. More than 99% of Boston Latin's approximately 400 annual graduates are accepted {{by at least one}} four-year college.|$|E
25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam.|$|E
500|$|The Australian press {{were shocked}} and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were {{ethically}} wrong. But at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated bodyline {{but would not}} speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments {{at the start of}} the tour that cricket [...] "has become a synonym for all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and honest.

Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters.

According to Deepa Gauri of the Khaleej Times, Maheshinte Prathikaram is a boon for a Malayalam cinema with an [...] "identity crisis". She praised the film's screenplay and direction: [...] "Every frame shows the minute detailing, which gives [...] its real heart. Charming you with wit, underlining humour and with characters who behave without any cinematic hangover". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee.com also gave a positive review: [...] "There {{is not a single}} scene in the film which appears cooked up ... He [...] must be commended for being sure-footed about what he intended to portray". Vikram praised the performances by Faasil and the supporting cast, the [...] "magnificent camera" [...] and the [...] "songs which seamlessly and melodiously merge with the narrative", concluding that it [...] "is a movie <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> to itself. It surprises with its all pervading simplicity and makes even revenge look like a stroll in the park".|$|E
500|$|Several decades later, in 1912, Episcopal Bishop Franklin S. Spalding sent {{copies of}} the three facsimiles to eight Egyptologists and semitists, soliciting their {{interpretation}} of the facsimiles; the results were published in a pamphlet entitled, Joseph Smith, Jr. as a Translator: An Inquiry. The eight scholars recognized the facsimiles as portions of ordinary funerary documents, and some harshly condemned Smith's interpretation. Egyptologist James H. Breasted of the University of Chicago noted: [...] "hese three facsimiles of Egyptian documents in the 'Pearl of Great Price' depict the most common objects in the Mortuary religion of Egypt. Joseph Smith’s interpretations of {{them as part of}} a unique revelation through Abraham, therefore, very clearly demonstrates that he was totally unacquainted with the significance of these documents and absolutely ignorant of the simplest facts of Egyptian writing and civilization." [...] Flinders Petrie of London University wrote: [...] "It may be safely said that there is not one single word <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in these explanations".
