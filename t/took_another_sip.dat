5000|$|On July 20, Markle tricked a {{desk clerk}} at the Homewood Suites in Lexington, Kentucky into {{drinking}} another person’s urine. The prank started with a call to a guest. The guest was told it was the front desk calling and that a prior guest had tested positive for Hepatitis C. The guest was then told there was a doctor on site and a simple urine test could determine if the guest was infected. The urine was {{to be brought to}} the front desk in a simple drinking glass. Switching roles, Markle then called the front desk alleging to be an employee of Martinelli's Cider. He told the clerk that a representative from the company would like to come downstairs with a sample of their new drink. The guest from the previous call then arrived and handed the clerk his urine. Markle then coaxed the woman to try it. He asked how it tasted. [...] "Horrible," [...] she said. [...] "That does not taste like cider. I'm not going to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> that's horrible." [...] Markle replied: [...] "Well, I need to inform you of something, ma'am. I want you to understand that you just drank that man's urine." [...] In its investigation, the Lufkin Police Department's cyber crimes division requested a subpoena for Markle's Skype activities. The police report classifies the Lexington incident as first-degree wanton endangerment, a Class D felony in Kentucky. [...] Markle was subsequently sentenced to a shock incarceration term of six months.|$|R
60|$|So saying, Aunt Keziah <b>took</b> yet <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of {{the beloved}} liquid, after vainly {{pressing}} Septimius {{to do the}} like; and then lighting her old clay pipe, she {{sat down in the}} chimney-corner, meditating, dreaming, muttering pious prayers and ejaculations, and sometimes looking up the wide flue of the chimney, with thoughts, perhaps, how delightful it must have been to fly up there, in old times, on excursions by midnight into the forest, where was the Black Man, and the Puritan deacons and ladies, and those wild Indian ancestors of hers; and where the wildness of the forest was so grim and delightful, and so unlike the common-placeness in which she spent her life. For thus did the savage strain of the woman, mixed up as it was with the other weird and religious parts of her composition, sometimes snatch her back into barbarian life and its instincts; and in Septimius, though further diluted, and modified likewise by higher cultivation, there was the same tendency.|$|R
40|$|It was a brisk fall day in Boston—the type of {{day that}} Dr. William Castle {{preferred}} {{to start with}} a cup of coffee while he caught up on his correspondence, which often appeared to be an endless task. As a faculty member of Harvard Medical School, he had always received a fair amount of inquiries, but after he had published his data indicating that pernicious anemia was due to a vitamin B 12 deficiency, the amount of mail he received was sometimes overwhelming. Sitting in his reclining chair he sorted through the large pile that had accumulated. He began to meticulously segregate it into smaller piles he would open in a prescribed order. Usually the delegation of a particular envelope was a relatively easy choice. There were a few that caused him to pause for a moment, such as the one he was currently holding. The return address indicated it was from an Irving Sherman at Johns Hopkins University. Since it was from someone he had never heard of, he was inclined to place it in the pile to be opened later. But on this day he decided to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of coffee and see what Mr. Sherman had to say (see next page). * Disclaimer: This case is a work of fiction that refers to real events and people. All of the discoveries mentioned in Section 1 were made by the individuals they are attributed to, as were the observations made by Dr. Vernon Hahn described in Section 2. The time between discoveries has been dramatically condensed, however. Every effort has been made to present the scientific considerations concisely and accurately.

60|$|The bluff doctor {{put on his}} spectacles, {{and looked}} over the slip of yellow and worn paper scrutinizingly, puffing tobacco-smoke upon it in great volumes, as if thereby to make its hidden purport come out; he mumbled to himself, he <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> from his flask; and then, putting {{it down on the}} table, {{appeared}} to meditate.|$|E
6000|$|Jack waited. The fiery grip of {{the brandy}} relaxed; the genial warmth of it was wafted through him persuasively from head to foot. He <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> His eyes began to glitter. [...] "What divine being made this?" [...] he asked. Without waiting to be answered, he tried it again, and emptied the cup. [...] "More!" [...] he cried. [...] "I never felt so big, I never felt so strong, I never felt so clever, as I feel now!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{unexpected}} deviation into sense {{increased the}} general feeling of discomfort. It became {{necessary to take}} the old man seriously, to regard him as a human being. Up till then he had been {{no more than an}} object of curiosity, a mummy in an absurd suit of evening-clothes with a green ribbon across the shirt front. People could not help wishing that they had subscribed a little more. Fifty-eight pounds ten it wasn't enormous. But happily for the peace of mind of the company, Mr. Tillotson paused again, <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> of wine, and began {{to live up to his}} proper character by talking absurdly.|$|E
6000|$|Foster's {{first impulse}} was to spit out the sip he had taken, for to his {{surprise}} the coffee was thick with grounds. He swallowed it, however, and wondered. Then, on taking <b>another</b> <b>sip</b> and considering it, he perceived that the grounds were not as grounds {{to which he had}} been accustomed, but were reduced--no doubt by severe pounding--to a pasty condition, which made the beverage resemble chocolate. [...] "Coffee-soup! with sugar--but no milk!" [...] he muttered, as he tried <b>another</b> <b>sip.</b> This third one convinced him that the ideas of Arabs regarding coffee did not coincide with those of Englishmen, so he finished the cup at the fourth sip, much as he would have taken a dose of physic, and thereafter amused himself with contemplating the other coffee-sippers.|$|R

60|$|So saying, {{he began}} slowly and painfully, but with unyielding perseverance, to push, and draw, and hitch himself, while lying at full length, towards the spring, which he reached at last so exhausted, {{that he had}} barely put his lips to it and {{swallowed}} a mouthful, when his head dropped, and he almost fainted. He was within an ace of being drowned, but with a violent effort he drew his face out of the spring, and lay there in a half unconscious condition for some time, with the clear cool water playing about his temples. Reviving in a little time, he <b>took</b> <b>another</b> <b>sip,</b> and then crawled back to his couch. Immediately he fell into a profound slumber, from which Cuffy strove in vain to awaken him; therefore, like a sagacious dog, he lay down at his master's side and joined him in repose.|$|E

She was a lively young woman, sir, before marriage, and their gloom and austerity destroyed her. They go about with her, now, more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law.

50|$|P-Called-Party-ID: The URI {{originally}} {{indicated in}} the request-URI of a request generated by the calling user agent. When the request reaches the registrar (S-CSCF) of the called user, the registrar re-writes the request-URI on {{the first line of}} the request with the registered contact address (i.e. IP address) of the called user, and stores the replaced request-URI in this header field. In the IMS, a user may be identified by several SIP URIs (address-of-record), for instance, a SIP URI for work and <b>another</b> <b>SIP</b> URI for personal use, and when the registrar replaces the request-URI with the effective contact address, the original request-URI must be stored so that the called party knows to which address-of-record was the invitation sent.|$|R

After all, Connie, these troubles which have tried us so severely have only proved blessings in disguise. Yes, Fan, we have been driven hither and thither about the sea, encountering terrible storms, and sometimes fearing that our bark was about to founder; but they have at last driven us into a haven more sweet and restful than storm-tossed mariners ever entered before.

30|$|The {{final step}} of the {{procedure}} consists of <b>another</b> <b>SIP</b> message, called Join/Leave Response, sent by the MBSC-SS to the client (see Figure 4), and used to notify it whether his request was successfully processed by the signaling entities. It {{is worth noting that}} this message is not mandatory, and could be avoided in order to save bandwidth, unless it is used to transport some information needed by the application to receive the content. For example, it could transport a cryptographic key needed by the client software to decode the streamed data, or custom data enabling more options for service providers, such as live advertisements or notifications. When the packets of the joined session are routed to the BS, they are delivered to the SU through the established multicast connection over the air.|$|R

They do not reveal how miruvor was made, but it is thought to come from the honey of the undying flowers in the gardens of Yavanna. Elrond gives a flask of miruvor to Gandalf when the Fellowship embarked on their quest.
