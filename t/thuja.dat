However, the species typically used for cedar chests and closets in North America is Juniperus virginiana, which is different from the true cedars (note also common confusion with <b>Thuja</b> spp. below).

5000|$|Shaohao's tomb {{complex is}} best known for the {{pyramidal}} monument which {{stands in front of the}} tomb itself, and which is often mistaken for the tomb. Called [...] "Shou Qiu" [...] ("mound or hill of longevity"), this monument marks the birthplace of the Yellow Emperor according to legend. It is unique in China because of its pyramid-shaped stone construction. It consists of a mound that has been covered with stone slabs during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song dynasty in 1111 CE. The entire pyramid is 28.5 metres wide and 8.73 meters high. On its flat top stands a small pavilion that houses a statue, variously identified as the Yellow Emperor or Shaohao.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, conifers of column-like shape were planted, probably <b>thujas</b> and blue spruces, around the entrance to the konak, as well as the thick planted conifers towards the court, and after the demolition of the Old konak in 1904, the area of the garden increased a lot. The planted trees in the garden advanced over the time, so this part of the park is nowadays rich in the most significant and the oldest vegetation. Until the Second World War the area of the court complex on Terazije was enclosed. After the reconstruction done when the Second World War ended, the former court complex was conceived as the administrative federal and republic centre. Thereto, the fence around the complex was removed, as well as the court guard building and many utility buildings. One of the most important projects of this reconstruction was orienting the former court complex towards the National Assembly building, thus realizing the idea about the forming of the representative administrative centre. The redecoration of the court garden started after the design of the architect Aleksandar Đorđević, and finished after the design of the forestry engineer Vladeta Đorđević. The former court garden was named Pioneers` park. Today`s area around the Pioneers` park, which by origin belongs to the type of the residential parks, consists of three parts, different in concept: the part towards Kralja Aleksandra Boulevard, decorated in free style, the area between the courts with the fountain, and the green area in front of the Old Palace.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum var. distichum) is a {{coniferous}} tree of tremendous ecological and economic importance. It {{is a member}} of the family Cupressaceae which also includes cypresses, redwoods, sequoias, <b>thujas,</b> and junipers. While the bald cypress genome is more than three times the size of the human genome, its 1 C DNA content is amongst the smallest of any conifer. To learn more about the genome of bald cypress and gain insight into the evolution of Cupressaceae genomes, we performed a Cot analysis and used Cot filtration to study Taxodium DNA. Additionally, we constructed a 6. 7 genome-equivalent BAC library that we screened with known Taxodium genes and select repeats. Results The bald cypress genome is composed of 90 % repetitive DNA with most sequences being found in low to mid copy numbers. The most abundant repeats are found in fewer than 25, 000 copies per genome. Approximately 7. 4 % of the genome is single/low-copy DNA (i. e., sequences found in 1 to 5 copies). Sequencing of highly repetitive Cot clones indicates that most Taxodium repeats are highly diverged from previously characterized plant repeat sequences. The bald cypress BAC library consists of 606, 336 clones (average insert size of 113 kb) and collectively provides 6. 7 -fold genome equivalent coverage of the bald cypress genome. Macroarray screening with known genes produced, on average, about 1. 5 positive clones per probe per genome-equivalent. Library screening with Cot- 1 DNA revealed that approximately 83 % of BAC clones contain repetitive sequences iterated 10 3 to 10 4 times per genome. Conclusions The BAC library for bald cypress is the first to be generated for a conifer species outside of the family Pinaceae. The Taxodium BAC library was shown to be useful in gene isolation and genome characterization and should be an important tool in gymnosperm comparative genomics, physical mapping, genome sequencing, and gene/polymorphism discovery. The single/low-copy (SL) component of bald cypress is 4. 6 times the size of the Arabidopsis genome. As suggested for other gymnosperms, the large amount of SL DNA in Taxodium is likely the result of divergence among ancient repeat copies and gene/pseudogene duplication. </p...|$|R
25|$|Totem poles {{serve as}} {{important}} illustrations of family lineage {{and the cultural}} heritage of the Native peoples in the islands and coastal areas of North America's Pacific Northwest, especially British Columbia, Canada, and coastal areas of Washington and southeastern Alaska in the United States. Families of traditional carvers come from the Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Kwakwaka’wakw (Kwakiutl), Nuxalk (Bella Coola), and Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka), among others. The poles are typically carved from the highly rot-resistant trunks of <b>Thuja</b> plicata trees (popularly known as giant cedar or western red cedar), which eventually decay in the moist, rainy climate of the coastal Pacific Northwest. Because of the region's climate {{and the nature of}} the materials used to make the poles, few examples carved before 1900 remain. Noteworthy examples, some dating as far back as 1880, include those at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria and the Museum of Anthropology at UBC in Vancouver.|$|E
