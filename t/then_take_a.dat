5|$|Low {{attendance}} and poor weather marred the contest, which kicked off amid rain and fog. Defense dominated from the beginning, as Georgia Tech took a 30 {{lead in the}} first quarter. Wake Forest evened the score before halftime, however, and the two teams headed into the second half tied at 33. After a scoreless third quarter, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead {{early in the fourth}} quarter. After Tech quarterback Reggie Ball threw a critical interception, Wake Forest was able to tie the game, <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> 96 lead. With time running out, Wake's defense denied Georgia Tech a game-winning score, and Wake Forest clinched the win.|$|E
5|$|Poonam's {{simple and}} affectionate {{demeanor}} impresses Bhagatji (Manoj Joshi), {{a close friend}} of Krishnakant and a jeweller by profession. Bhagatji takes Poonam's marriage proposal for Prem. When Harishchandra takes his opinion on the proposition, Prem is initially hesitant and feels he is too young for marriage and needs to focus on his career first. Harishchandra convinces Prem to meet Poonam before deciding about anything. Respecting father's wishes, Prem agrees to meet Poonam, get to know better and <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> decision. They visit Krishnakant's family and let Prem and Poonam get acquainted with each other. Though their first conversation is awkward, Prem and Poonam agree to get married, as they are instantly attracted to each other. Prem and Poonam gets engaged and set to be married in six months. Krishnakant invites Prem's family to their summer residence in Som Sarovar, so Prem and Poonam get the opportunity to know each other better.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E

5|$|Things <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{turn for}} the very worst, as McLaren unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to kill Waingro, who in turn betrays the team to the police. When Hanna arrives on the scene unexpectedly with the police, McLaren and his crew engage them in a mid-street shootout, in which most of McLaren's crew are killed. After making an unlikely escape, McLaren is presented {{with an opportunity to}} leave Los Angeles for a new life with Eady, but he decides to first take revenge for Waingro's betrayal. However, after McLaren tracks down Waingro to a hotel room, he is ambushed by Hanna and his team. Waingro takes advantage of the confusion to shoot McLaren through a closed door. While Hanna advises Waingro of his options in jail, for a string of previous murders, Waingro resists arrest and tries to pull a gun. In self-defence, Hanna forces Waingro through a hotel window, and Waingro falls fifteen floors to his death. In the final sequences, Hanna is reunited with his wife.|$|E

25|$|Charlotte would {{score on}} the opening play of the fourth quarter on a Kalif Phillips 1 yard rushing {{touchdown}}. Three series later Joe Callahan would connect with Bryce Shade for a 17-yard passing touchdown to tie the score {{for the third time}} in the day. With 2 and a half minutes left on the clock Wesley would retake the lead on a Joe Callahan 1 yard rushing touchdown. Charlotte would put together a 12 play drive to get to the Wesley 28 yard line, but Charlotte Quarterback Matt Johnson would be unable to connect on three subsequent passing plays and would turn the ball over on downs. Wesley would <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> knee to win 35 to 28.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} when the BART-SFO Extension opened on June 22, 2003, there was a Millbrae–SFO Line, a shuttle line that {{operated}} every 20 minutes between Millbrae and San Francisco Airport, formerly depicted as a purple line. This line has been defunct as of February 2004. It was replaced by the Pittsburg/Bay Point line and the Richmond Line, and in 2005 by the Dublin/Pleasanton line. On January 1, 2008, direct service between Millbrae and SFO was eliminated; passengers traveling between Millbrae and SFO have the inconvenience of boarding a train at Millbrae, traveling to San Bruno, and <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> different train back to the airport. Direct service to SFO from Millbrae was restored in September 2009, but only during off-peak hours and weekends.|$|E
25|$|The Rays {{looked to}} be in shape to win the series early in Game 3, after Akinori Iwamura hit an infield single to bring in the game's first run, but starter Matt Garza allowed the White Sox to tie the game in the 3rd inning, and <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 lead in the 4th inning. Juan Uribe of the White Sox added an RBI single in the 6th inning to {{increase}} the lead for Chicago. B.J. Upton hit a 2-run home run for the Rays in the 7th inning to make the game a bit closer, but the Rays could not get their bats going enough. The White Sox would take Game 3 by a final score of 5–3, living to play another day only down two games to one in the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace were in her charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers.

Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he went to this villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession.

25|$|On February 26, 2008, {{just hours}} before the trade deadline, the Stars traded for All-Star center Brad Richards from the Tampa Bay Lightning for backup netminder Mike Smith and {{forwards}} Jussi Jokinen and Jeff Halpern. The Stars rallied to a final record of 45–30–7 and qualified for the playoffs as the fifth seed, matching up with the defending Stanley Cup champion, the Anaheim Ducks, in the first round. After a rough end to the season, only winning two games in March of that year, the Stars shocked everyone by winning {{the first two games}} of the series in Anaheim, and then would go on to finish off the Ducks in six games, their first playoff series win since 2003. In the second round, the Stars matched up with the Pacific Division champion San Jose Sharks. Once again, the Stars surprised everyone by winning the first two games of the series on the road. In Game 2, Brad Richards tied an NHL record by recording four points in the third period. The Stars would <b>then</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 lead after a Mattias Norstome overtime goal in Game 3. Captain Brenden Morrow finished the Sharks off in Game 6 with a powerplay goal nearly halfway into the fourth overtime. The win sent the Stars to their first Conference Finals since 2000, where they met the powerhouse Detroit Red Wings. After falling behind 3–0, the Stars made a series of it, however, winning two games before ultimately finally being ousted by the Red Wings in six games.|$|E
