2500|$|Just {{five days}} after the shootings, 100,000 people {{demonstrated}} in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of unarmed student protesters. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969 to 1974, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, [...] "The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that's civil war." [...] Not only was Nixon taken to Camp David for two days for his own protection, but Charles Colson (Counsel to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973) stated that the military was called up to protect the administration from the angry students; he recalled that [...] "The 82nd Airborne was {{in the basement of the}} executive office building, so I went down just <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the guys and walk among them, and they're lying on the floor leaning on their packs and their helmets and their cartridge belts and their rifles cocked and you're thinking, 'This can't be the United States of America. This is not the greatest free democracy in the world. This is a nation at war with itself.'" ...|$|E

60|$|Their womenkind {{left them}} {{at that moment}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> acquaintances seated a short {{distance}} way.

5000|$|He {{returns to}} the court where the King hands him an {{important}} assignment. The King's concubine, Jung-bin, had a painting she had drawn mounted, but it was replaced by an exact copy, she only realized {{because of the lack}} of a scribble she had drawn on the back. The King would like Yoon-seo to find the culprits. Yoon-seo is impressed by the talent of the artist who made the fraudulent copy. Jung-bin is in turn impressed by Yoon-seo's knowledge on the subject and invites him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her <b>some</b> more about art some day.|$|R
50|$|In 1634 John Christian came <b>to</b> Silesia <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with <b>some</b> Protestant {{subjects}} in the duchies and cities.

60|$|Columbine {{left the}} cowboy and rode up the lane toward Wade's cabin. She did not analyze her {{deliberate}} desire {{to tell the}} truth about that fight, but she would have liked to proclaim it to the whole range and to the world.

60|$|The colonel {{reined in}} his horse; {{and the two}} officers, who had not met for some years, entered into a warm conversation; while Will strolled away <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the younger officers, who congratulated him most heartily on the luck which had, in a few months, taken him over their heads.|$|E
60|$|They dined early, {{and in the}} evening, Bertram and {{his host}} walked out. Hitherto they had had but little {{opportunity}} of conversation, and Bertram longed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> one of what was within his breast. On this occasion, however, he failed. Conversation will not always go exactly as one would have it.|$|E
60|$|It was {{absolutely}} necessary, {{he said to}} himself, that he should know on what ground he stood; absolutely necessary, also, {{that he should be}} able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> one on the subject. So he wrote to Miss Baker, saying that he intended to do himself the pleasure of renewing his acquaintance with her at Littlebath, and he determined to see Arthur Wilkinson on his way. These were the days in which Wilkinson was taking pupils at Oxford, the days in which he used to think so much of Adela Gauntlet.|$|E

It’s worse being so close to you, and not being able to see you. So near and yet so far. And the time we do have together is so damned short. There’s nothing much I can tell you because I’ll probably tell you everything I did this week on Saturday. But I have been busy, at least the first part of the week, and I must say I’ve been pretty good about writing. I didn’t write last night because Steve and myself got <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> WACs over at the P. X. after I called you, and it was ten before I knew it. It was swell <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> you hon, you sounded like you had a cold, and that’s not good. Oh, by the way, my chapped lips are better, temporarily. It must be the cold weather in New York, (it says here). Well hon, I’m C. Q. today. I’ve got to go get the mail. Hope there’s a letter for me. I love you and still miss you. Give my best to your family. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|R

Supposing these people were found, they would certainly have to be watched until an extradition warrant could be obtained from England; but, above all, in such a quest it would be a satisfaction to have some one <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> <b>some</b> one who would be as keen in the search as he was himself.|$|E
60|$|Ken was too angry to talk any more, and so {{the boys}} went to bed. The next few days Ken {{discovered}} that either out of shame or growing estrangement Raymond avoided him, and he was bitterly hurt. He had come to like the little second-baseman, and had hoped they would be good friends. It {{was easy to see}} that Graves became daily bolder, and more lax in training, and his influence upon several of the boys grew stronger. And when Dean, Schoonover, and Duncan appeared to be joining the clique, Ken decided he would have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> one, so he went up to see Ray and Homans.|$|E

60|$|Hastily Mrs. Hilbery {{asked for}} further {{details of this}} {{extraordinary}} house, and interposed a few speculations about the meeting between Keats and Coleridge in a lane, which tided over the discomfort of the moment, and drew Katharine on to further descriptions and indiscretions. In truth, she found an extraordinary pleasure in being thus free <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> one who was equally wise and equally benignant, the mother of her earliest childhood, whose silence seemed to answer questions that were never asked. Mrs. Hilbery listened without making any remark for a considerable time. She seemed to draw her conclusions rather by looking at her daughter than by listening to her, and, if cross-examined, she would probably have given a highly inaccurate version of Ralph Denham's life-history except that he was penniless, fatherless, and lived at Highgate--all of which was much in his favor. But by means of these furtive glances she had assured herself that Katharine {{was in a state}} which gave her, alternately, the most exquisite pleasure and the most profound alarm.|$|E

6000|$|Earlier {{in the day}} he {{had been}} {{inspired}} by a vague yet splendid dream of large masterful liberations achieved.

From the stormy dissatisfaction of his retreat this one small idea crystallized, that he had not <b>talked</b> enough without disturbance <b>to</b> Lady Harman.

He had somehow to continue that conversation with Lady Harman.|$|R

"There's this appendy--whatever {{they call}} it," [...] commented Mrs. Wilkins, [...] "why {{a dozen years}} ago one poor {{creature}} out of ten thousand may possibly 'ave 'ad something wrong with 'is innards.

6000|$|I {{went with}} Denison {{and another man}} named Jeffreys between eleven [...] and twelve. We began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> men among Weyland's friends; [...] they crowded round, and began to holloa at us, and were making a [...] sort of ring round us preparatory to a desperate hustle, when lo! [...] up rushed a body of Norreys' men from St. Thomas's, broke their [...] ranks, raised a shout, and rescued us in great style. I shall ever [...] be {{grateful}} to the men of St. Thomas's. When we were talking, [...] Jeffreys said something which made one man holloa, 'Oh, his [...] father's a parson.' This happened to be true, and flabbergasted me, [...] but he happily turned it by reminding them, {{that they were going}} to [...] vote for Mr. Harcourt, son of the greatest parson in England but [...] one (Archbishop of York). Afterwards they left me, and I pursued my [...] work alone, conversed with a great number, shook hands with a fair [...] proportion, made some laugh, and once very nearly got hustled when [...] alone, but happily escaped. You would be beyond measure astonished [...] how unanimous and how strong is the feeling among the freeholders [...] (who may be taken as a fair specimen of the generality of all [...] counties) against the catholic question. Reformers and [...] anti-reformers were alike sensitive on that point and perfectly [...] agreed. One man said to me, 'What, vote for Lord Norreys? Why, he [...] voted against the country both times, for the Catholic bill and [...] then against the Reform.' What would this atrocious ministry have [...] said had the appeal to the voice of the people, which they now [...] quote as their authority, been made in 1829? I held forth to a [...] working man, possibly a forty-shilling freeholder, [he adds in a [...] fragment of later years,] on the established text, reform was [...] revolution. To corroborate my doctrine I said, 'Why, look at the [...] revolutions in foreign countries,' meaning of course France and [...] Belgium. The man looked hard at me and said these very words, 'Damn [...] all foreign countries, what has old England to do with foreign [...] countries?' This is not the only time that I have received an [...] important lesson from a humble source.|$|E

"It {{was from}} there the National Film Board (NFB) {{saw it and}} I was invited by some {{producers}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> of the filmmakers there," [...] said Obomsawin.

60|$|So Alaric went to work, {{and studied}} the dry subject that was before him. It will luckily not be {{necessary}} {{for us to do}} so also. It will be sufficient for us to know that Wheal Mary Jane was at that moment the richest of all the rich mines that had then been opened in that district; that the, or its, or her shares (which is the proper way of speaking of them I am shamefully ignorant) were at an enormous premium; that these two Commissioners would have <b>to</b> see and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> scores of loud and angry men, deeply interested in their success or failure, and that that success or failure might probably in part depend on the view which these two Commissioners might take.|$|R

Mike was initially set as a [...] "preppy" [...] counterpoint to his college roommate, B.D., a stereotypical jock. The role as B.D.'s foil soon shifted to the more radical Mark Slackmeyer, and the hippie Zonker Harris.

6000|$|In some indefinable {{special way}} the bishop had {{been aware of}} Lady Sunderbund's {{presence}} since first he had met her, {{but it was only}} now that he could observe her with any particularity. She was tall like his own Lady Ella but not calm and quiet; she was electric, her eyes, her smiles, her complexion had as it were an established brightness that exceeded the common lustre of things. This morning she was dressed in grey that was nevertheless not grey but had an effect of colour, and there was a thread of black along the lines of her body and a gleam of gold. She carried her head back with less dignity than pride; there was a little frozen movement in her dark hair as if it flamed up out of her head. There were silver ornaments in her hair. She spoke with a pretty little weakness of the r's that had probably been acquired abroad. And she lost no time in telling him, she was eager to tell him, that she had been waylaying him. [...] "I did so want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>some</b> maw," [...] she said. [...] "I was shy last night and they we' all so noisy and eaga'.
