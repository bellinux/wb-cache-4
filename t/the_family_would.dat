5|$|Daniels {{announced}} he would not seek the Republican nomination for the presidency {{on the night of}} May 21, 2011, via an email to the press, citing family constraints and the loss of privacy <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> experience should he become a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control {{as a way of}} making the family lands book-land and free from secular service. Book-land was at first an exclusive right of ecclesiastical property. By transferring land to a family-controlled monastery, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> retain the use of the land without having to perform any services to the king for the land.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{was born}} on 6 June 1868, the third of six {{children}} and elder son of John Edward, a brewer and magistrate, and Hannah (née Cuming) Scott of Stoke Damerel, near Devonport. There were also naval and military traditions in the family, Scott's grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy. John Scott's prosperity came from the ownership of a small Plymouth brewery which he had inherited from his father and subsequently sold. Scott's early childhood years were spent in comfort, but some years later, when he was establishing his naval career, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> suffer serious financial misfortune.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as {{it seems to be a}} fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E

50|$|In each episode <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>would</b> win {{a number}} of ribbons based on their rank in {{competition}}. Prior to the ribbon competition, another competition allowed <b>the</b> winning <b>family</b> to choose either an advantage in the ribbon contest, or a valuable prize. If the prize was selected, <b>the</b> second place <b>family</b> <b>would</b> receive <b>the</b> advantage. Every two episodes, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> with <b>the</b> least number of ribbons would be sent home, and the scores would be reset so that all <b>families</b> <b>would</b> again be {{on an equal footing}} for the next elimination. <b>The</b> winning <b>family</b> was decided in a single head-to-head competition with no advantage competition.|$|R

5|$|Leopold {{had been}} {{specific}} in letters to Hagenauer that <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> not visit the Dutch Republic, but {{would go to}} Paris and then return home to Salzburg. However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, sister of the Prince of Orange, to go instead to The Hague and to present the children to her, as official guests of the court. After the party's landing at Calais there was a month's delay at Lille, as first Wolfgang fell sick with tonsillitis, then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks. Early in September the family moved on to Ghent, where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; {{a few days later}} he played on the cathedral organ at Antwerp. On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Sienkiewicz {{was born}} on 5 May 1846 in Wola Okrzejska, now a village in {{the central part of}} eastern Polish region of Lubelskie, then part of the Russian Empire. His family were impoverished Polish nobles, on his father's side {{deriving}} from Tatars who had settled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His parents were Józef Sienkiewicz (1813–96) and Stefania, née Cieciszowska (1820–73). He had five siblings: an older brother, Kazimierz (died during January Uprising), and four sisters, Aniela, Helena, Zofia and Maria. His family were entitled to use the Polish Oszyk coat of arms. Wola Okrzejska belonged to the writer's maternal grandmother, Felicjana Cieciszowska. His family moved several times, and young Henryk spent his childhood on family estates in Grabowce Górne, Wężyczyn and Burzec. In September 1858 he began his education in Warsaw, where <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> finally settle in 1861, having bought a tenement house (kamienica) in eastern Warsaw's Praga district. He received relatively poor school grades except in the humanities, notably Polish language and history.|$|E
5|$|TSN {{offered to}} {{broadcast}} her funeral live {{and to make}} the signal available to any other stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete's funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier was just getting underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina's Agridome and Schmirler's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker's husband.|$|E

5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} {{traditional}} Afrikaner farmers. As such, questions {{of property and}} family affairs were extensively governed by custom. Custom dictated that it was upon the first son that family expectations fell; <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> strive, so far as their means allowed, to provide him with the best possible education {{with the goal of}} paving the way for his entry into one of the professions. As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm, {{while at the same time}} receiving a rudimentary home education. As the second son this was to be Jan's role. While he remained at the farm, his elder brother, Michiel, was sent to begin his schooling in Riebeek West, destined, like his uncle Boudewyn, for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.|$|E
25|$|The Kaiser Family Foundation studied how consumer-driven {{health plans}} cover pregnancy. They found wide {{variations}} in cost sharing. Pregnant women could face exposure to high out-of-pocket costs under consumer-driven health plans, particularly when complications arise. In one scenario, a complicated pregnancy, with gestational diabetes, pre-term labor, cesarian section and neonatal intensive care, would cost $287,000. Under some consumer-directed health plans, {{the cost to}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> be $6,000, less than some traditional policies. But under other consumer-directed health plans, the cost to <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>would</b> {{be as high as}} $21,000.|$|E
