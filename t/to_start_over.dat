5|$|American Idiot is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Green Day. Produced by Rob Cavallo, {{the album was}} {{released}} in the UK on September 20, 2004 and in the US on September 21, 2004 by Reprise Records. Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s {{with a string of}} successful albums. Following disappointing sales of their sixth album, Warning (2000), the band took a break before recording their next album, titled Cigarettes and Valentines. The recording process was cut short when the album's master tapes were stolen. Rather than re-record that material, the group decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Boston, after Vivien (Connie Britton) catches Ben (Dylan McDermott) {{cheating}} on her, he begs for her forgiveness, {{and says he}} {{would do anything to}} save their marriage. This includes getting out of Boston and relocating to a different city. He shows her pictures of a great house in an older district of Los Angeles, claiming Vivien loves old houses. He tells her the price of the house is strangely lower than those around it, {{and that it would be}} a great place for the family <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over</b> on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E

5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over</b> by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over.</b> Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E
5|$|Chloe {{takes over}} full {{custody of her}} {{daughter}} from Billy; Delia is later diagnosed with leukemia, and Billy's bone marrow donation saves her life. During this trying time, Chloe reconnects with Kevin, and they become engaged following Delia's recovery. Mob princess Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo) arrives in town and develops a crush on Kevin. Her father Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr) blackmails Kevin into leaving Chloe at the altar and marry Angelina, which he does. Once Angelina leaves town, Chloe and Kevin marry and resume their courtship. The couple join forces with Adam (Michael Muhney) and Chelsea Newman (Melissa Claire Egan) to start a fashion website entitled TagNGrab. The site ends unsuccessfully, leaving Chloe and Kevin in need of money. In a Bonnie and Clyde themed story arc, they steal money to save their house. Their marriage flounders as Kevin continues to steal and lets Chloe spend a night in jail for his crime, and they decide to get a divorce, which particularly affects Delia who adored her stepfather. During this period Chloe develops a fashion line for Jabot's fashion division with her best friend, Chelsea. Months later, Chloe and Kevin decide <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over</b> and begin dating again. On the night of Delia's performance in a play, Billy leaves Delia and her dog, Dash, alone in his car while purchasing ice-cream. Dash runs off, causing Delia to run after him. Delia is struck down by a car believed {{to be driven by}} Adam, before being rushed to the hospital and dying of her injuries. When she learns of Delia's death from Billy at the hospital, Chloe breaks down and begins lashing out emotionally at Billy and everyone around her. Chloe decides to honor Delia by donating her corneas to Adam's son, Connor, who needs a transplant to save his eyesight. The operation is successful and Connor's vision is restored.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{and most}} 220-240V territories, the line voltage is {{sufficient}} <b>to</b> <b>start</b> lamps <b>over</b> 20W {{with a series}} inductor. In North America and Japan however, the line voltage (120V or 100V respectively) may not be sufficient <b>to</b> <b>start</b> lamps <b>over</b> 20W with a series inductor, so an autotransformer winding {{is included in the}} ballast to step up the voltage. The autotransformer is designed with enough leakage inductance (short-circuit inductance) so that the current is appropriately limited.|$|R

5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, bringing in a live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>over,</b> so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E
