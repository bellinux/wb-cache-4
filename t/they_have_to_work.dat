25|$|In {{response}} to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates {{a process known as}} iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to get iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and Borrelia burgdorferi utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with hemochromatosis, are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel." [...] However, Observer television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic: ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{is one of}} the academies {{that was}} instituted during the 2011-2012 school year. The FOCUS academy {{attempted}} to focus in on the 13% of students in the entire high school. [...] Speaking earlier about the plans, district superintendent Dr. Richard N. Johns said there are four types of students that would be targeted for the FOCUS academy — students who are at risk of dropping out, not graduating on time, not graduating and receiving a General Education Diploma, and students who are graduating with a 75 percent average or below. This program will be flexible with time and will allow students to come for their core classes and graduation requirements and leave {{for the remainder of the}} day, should <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> or other extenuating circumstances. This academy was scheduled to be the first one implemented and was set to be used in the 2011–2012 school year. This academy was housed in the Wetzel Road Elementary building, which was closed last spring because of declining enrollment and an $11 million budget shortfall. It will first need a few renovations including new gang bathrooms and science laboratories. The FOCUS academy was ultimately shut down after in session for one year as it was deemed a major waste as a part of the school budget without any significant improvements by students.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} women who attend school in urban areas vs. rural areas differs drastically. [...] In urban areas, women's {{education}} is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live in urban areas are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent in urban areas are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> harder than women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also don’t attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They’re also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one.|$|E

Precisely the same outward effect was produced here, however, by her rising when the clock struck ten and hanging up a thick cloth curtain. The door it was necessary to keep ajar in hers, as in most cottages, because of the smoke; but she obviated the effect of the ribbon of light through the chink by hanging a cloth over that also. She {{was one of those people}} who, if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> harder than their neighbors, prefer to keep the necessity a secret as far as possible; and but for the slight sounds of wood-splintering which came from within, no wayfarer would have perceived that here the cottager did not sleep as elsewhere.|$|E

But when the working-men have left the militia, what have they done? They have eliminated the only thing that disqualifies it for prompt and unsparing use against strikers. As long as they are in it we might have our misgivings, but if they were once out of it we should have none. And what would they gain? They {{would not be allowed to}} arm and organize as an inimical force. That was settled once for all in Chicago, in the case of the International Groups. A few squads of policemen would break them up. Why," [...] the banker exclaimed, with his good-humored laugh, [...] "how preposterous they are when you come to look at it! They are in the majority, the immense majority, if you count the farmers, and they prefer to behave as if they were the hopeless minority. They say they want an eight-hour law, and every now and then they strike and try to fight it. Why don't they vote it? They could make it the law in six months by such overwhelming numbers that no one would dare to evade or defy it. They can make any law they want, but they prefer to break such laws as we have. That 'alienates public sympathy,' the newspapers say; but the spectacle of their stupidity and helpless wilfulness is so lamentable that I could almost pity them. If they chose, it would take only a few years to transform our government into the likeness of anything they wanted. But they would rather not have what they want, apparently, if they can only keep themselves from getting it, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard to do that!" ...|$|E

60|$|But, {{it will be}} said, {{it is not so}} {{much the}} {{materials}} as the form and structure of nests, that vary so much, and are so wonderfully adapted to the wants and habits of each species; how are these to be accounted for except by instinct? I reply, they may be in a great measure explained by the general habits of the species, the nature of the tools <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with, and the materials they can most easily obtain, with the very simplest adaptations of means to an end, quite within the mental capacities of birds. The delicacy and perfection of the nest will bear a direct relation to the size of the bird, its structure and habits. That of the wren or the humming-bird is perhaps not finer or more beautiful in proportion than that of the blackbird, the magpie, or the crow. The wren, having a slender beak, long legs, and great activity, is able with great ease to form a well-woven nest of the finest materials, and places it in thickets and hedgerows which it frequents in its search for food. The titmouse, haunting fruit-trees and walls, and searching in cracks and crannies for insects, is naturally led to build in holes where it has shelter and security; while its great activity, and the perfection of its tools (bill and feet), enable it readily to form a beautiful receptacle for its eggs and young. Pigeons having heavy bodies and weak feet and bills (imperfect tools for forming a delicate structure) build rude, flat nests of sticks, laid across strong branches which will bear their weight and that of their bulky young. They can do no better. The Caprimulgidæ have the most imperfect tools of all, feet that will not support them except on a flat surface (for they cannot truly perch) and a bill excessively broad, short, and weak, and almost hidden by feathers and bristles. They cannot build a nest of twigs or fibres, hair or moss, like other birds, and they therefore generally dispense with one altogether, laying their eggs on the bare ground, or on the stump or flat limb of a tree. The clumsy hooked bills, short necks and feet, and heavy bodies of Parrots, render them quite incapable of building a nest like most other birds. They cannot climb up a branch without using both bill and feet; they cannot even turn round on a perch without holding on with their bill. How, then, could they inlay, or weave, or twist the materials of a nest? Consequently, they all lay in holes of trees, the tops of rotten stumps, or in deserted ants' nests, the soft materials of which they can easily hollow out.|$|E
