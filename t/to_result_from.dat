5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{genealogy}} of Ine and of {{the kings}} of Wessex is known from two sources: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List. The Chronicle {{was created in the}} late 9th century, probably at the court of Alfred the Great, and some of its annals incorporated short genealogies of kings of Wessex. These are often at variance with the more extensive information in the Regnal List. The inconsistencies appear <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the efforts of later chroniclers to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from Cerdic, the founder, according to the Chronicle, of the West Saxon line in England.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} appears <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> developmental {{factors that}} affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
5|$|Impact crater diameters seen {{range from}} 0.1kma limit {{defined by the}} imaging resolutionto over 100km, not {{counting}} the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 540km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25100km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60km can have central domes, which are thought <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and Hár craters. A small number of very largemore 100km in diameterand bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E

5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|The 7.7million day {{visitors}} and 5.5million who made overnight {{stays on the}} Norfolk coast in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and secured the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs in that area. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites, including Blakeney, Cley and Morston found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as {{the main purpose of}} their visit. The villages nearest to the Point, Blakeney and Cley, had the highest per capita spend per visitor of those surveyed, and Cley was one of the two sites with the highest proportion of pre-planned visits. The equivalent of 52 full-time jobs in the Cley and Blakeney area are estimated <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the £2.45million spent locally by the visiting public. In addition to birdwatching and boat trips to see the seals, sailing and walking are the other significant tourist activities in the area.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the magnitude2.2 Alpha Coronae Borealis.

T Coronae Borealis, {{also known as the}} Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a recurrent nova. Normally of magnitude10, it last flared up to magnitude2 in 1946. ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter-sized exoplanets. Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster one billion light-years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis Supercluster.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Callisto {{is the oldest}} and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is {{completely}} covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters (catenae) and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought <b>to</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.|$|E
