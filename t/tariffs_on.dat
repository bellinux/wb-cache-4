5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> {{the import of}} luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain, {{which is not the}} same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> national exports, but kept high ones for imports.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to attract use of the Trans-Siberian to {{transport}} goods from Japan, China, and Korea to Europe, in the mid-1990s Russia lowered <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> freight using the railway. As a result, freight volume over the rail line doubled in 1999 and 2000.|$|E

40|$|In a {{vertically}} differentiated monopolistic framework with discrete preferences {{we examine}} how protecting the low-quality segment raises {{the incentive for}} quality innovation. We show how the monopolist facing competitive imports, might fail to exert its complete monopoly power {{even if there is}} prohibitive <b>tariff</b> <b>on</b> both the high and low quality segment of the market. On the other hand, given non prohibitive <b>tariff</b> <b>on</b> the high quality segment, the potential gain for the monopolist exhausts at a level much below the prohibitive low-quality tariff level. Also a sufficiently low <b>tariff</b> <b>on</b> the high quality product can force the monopolist to produce the first best qualities irrespective of the <b>tariff</b> level <b>on</b> the low quality product...|$|R

The tariff rate differential exists {{because there is no}} tariff classification that deals specifically with 4 WDs. This Research Note examines the rationale for the lower <b>tariff</b> rate <b>on</b> 4 WDs and its impact on passenger car sales...|$|R

As {{a result of this}} partnership, Airbus plans to open an assembly line for CSeries aircraft in Mobile, particularly to serve the US market. This effort may allow the companies to circumvent high import <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> the CSeries family.|$|E
5|$|The {{clothing}} and textile industry has benefited most from this arrangement. As <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> these goods into the United States are relatively high, exporters {{have used the}} duty-free benefits of QIZs to gain quick access to markets in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{customs law}} set trade {{barriers}} to products {{produced in the}} country, and imposed high import <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> luxury goods, together with export quotas and <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> gold and silver. However, the law was not completely effective because of {{the control of the}} port, which did not allow the provinces a steady financial income. The exclusive control of the port was long resisted by federals from other provinces, and led to the conflict of Rosas and Justo José de Urquiza at the battle of Caseros. Despite the financial obstacles, the economy of Entre Ríos has grew to a size near that of Buenos Aires, with the decline of saladeros and the growth of wool production.|$|E
50|$|In 2017, a U.S. trade {{court ruled}} that the product should be {{classified}} as a blanket, rather than clothing, as government lawyers had been trying to claim.

5|$|In 1889, {{with the}} Republicans in the majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> foreign goods.|$|E
5|$|U.S. President Herbert Hoover {{signed the}} Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act into law on June 17, 1930. The tariff's {{aim was to}} protect {{agriculture}} in the United States, but congressional representatives ultimately raised <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> a host of manufactured goods resulting in average duties as high as 53% on over a thousand various goods. Twenty-five trading partners responded in kind by introducing new <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> {{a wide range of}} U.S. goods. Hoover was pressured and compelled to adhere to the Republican Party's 1928 platform, which sought protective tariffs to alleviate market pressures on the nation's struggling agribusinesses and reduce the domestic unemployment rate. The culmination of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression heightened fears, further pressuring Hoover to act on protective policies against the advice of Henry Ford and over 1,000 economists who protested by calling for a veto of the act. Exports from the United States plummeted 60% from 1930 to 1933. Worldwide international trade virtually ground to a halt. The international ramifications of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, comprising protectionist and discriminatory trade policies and bouts of economic nationalism, are credited by economists with prolongment and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially afloat. National income was desperately needed and most came from <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> imported goods. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|E

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
5|$|At its U.S. debut, the {{redesigned}} LS 400 {{retained a}} pricing advantage over European competitors in its largest market, launching with a base price of US$51,000. However, cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers. To promote their new flagship, Lexus launched a US$50 million advertising campaign, {{the most expensive}} marketing effort since {{the launch of the}} division. In mid-1995, sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit, potentially raising the price of a fully optioned LS 400 to over US$100,000. Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year, and sales recovered in the following months. Ultimately, second-generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model; production totaled approximately 114,000 units.|$|E
5|$|In November 1997, Robin Raphel was {{appointed}} as United States Ambassador to Tunisia. Tunisia {{was a frequent}} partner for Mediterranean military exercises with U.S. naval squadrons and marine battalions, allowing more exercises in its waters {{than any other country}} in North Africa. When Raphel was ambassador, Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economics, Business and Agriculture, proposed a new initiative to liberalize trade further with Tunisia. The Eizenstat Initiative, as it came to be known informally, implemented lower <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> industrial and manufacturing sector goods to enable Tunisia to become a supplier for goods throughout Arab and African states. President Zine El Abidine visited the Clinton White House in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Initially conservative, {{working with}} Wilson (who was elected president) {{inspired}} Barkley {{to become more}} liberal. On April 24, 1912, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act which lowered <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's New Freedom agenda, including the 1913 Federal Reserve Act and the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act. Because of {{his support for the}} administration, he was assigned to the powerful Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House. As a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, he supported the Clayton Antitrust Act and sought to end child labor in interstate commerce through the Keating–Owen Act in 1916. He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.|$|E
5|$|When Harding {{took office}} on March 4, 1921, {{the nation was}} in the midst of a postwar {{economic}} decline. At the suggestion of its leaders, Harding called a special session of Congress to convene on April 11. When Harding addressed the joint session the following day, he urged the reduction of income taxes (raised during the war), an increase in <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> agricultural goods to protect the American farmer, as well as more wide-ranging reforms, such as support for highways, aviation, and radio. But it was not until May 27 that Congress passed an emergency tariff increase on agricultural products. An act authorizing a Bureau of the Budget followed on June 10; Harding appointed Charles Dawes as bureau director with a mandate to cut expenditures.|$|E

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, privatisation became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone privatisation, to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After privatisation the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of privatisation was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced protective <b>tariffs</b> <b>on</b> agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E
