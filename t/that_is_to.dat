5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style.

5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> integrate themselves with the ruling elite.

40|$|Abstract—A {{number of}} signal {{processing}} applications require {{the estimation of}} covariance matrices. Sometimes, the particular scenario or system imparts a certain theoretical structure on the matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated. Using this knowledge allows the design of algorithms exploiting such structure, resulting in more robust and accurate estimators, especially for small samples. We study a scenario with a measured covariance matrix known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Kronecker product of two other, possibly structured, covari-ance matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated. Examples of scenarios in which such a problem occurs are MIMO-communications and EEG measurements. When the matrices <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> estimated are Toeplitz structured, we show our algorithms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> achieve the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound already at very small sample sizes.

5|$|Its {{large size}} {{may have been}} due to climactic factors and the {{abundance}} of large prey items, and it may have also been influenced by the evolution of regional endothermy (mesothermy) which would have increased its metabolism. However, since the Otodontidae sharks are considered to have been ectotherms, and megalodon was a close relative to them, megalodon may have also been ectothermic. Contrary to this, the largest contemporary ectothermic sharks, such as the whale shark, are filter feeders, implying some metabolic constraints with a predatory lifestyle. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> say, it is unlikely that megalodon was ectothermic.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> say it was higher up in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|The Clausius–Clapeyron {{relation}} {{leads to}} another equation also attributed to Kelvin, as the Kelvin equation.

5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the key information from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E
5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>to</b> an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E
5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> say, {{the remains of}} a plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors plateau.|$|E
