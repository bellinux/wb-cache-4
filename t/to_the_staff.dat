40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a linear programming (LP) model for simultaneously solving an operator staffing prob-lem in a semiconductor fab. <b>The</b> problem is <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> level and assign operators <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> positions. <b>The</b> semiconductor fab has the following characteristics: it imposes a no-lay-off policy, but allows overtime; keeps high-quality shop floor operations; aims <b>to</b> control tightly <b>the</b> <b>staffing</b> costs; and faces frequent changes of product mix. <b>The</b> operator <b>staffing</b> problem {{in such a}} fab was not addressed in previous literature.

5|$|Blackburn's sympathies {{lay with}} the Confederacy at the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War. Too old to enlist in the Confederate Army, he acted as an envoy for Kentucky governor Beriah Magoffin to obtain weapons from Louisiana for the defense of Kentucky, but he failed to secure the arms. In early 1862, he was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> of Major General Sterling Price as a surgeon. Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus appointed him as one of two commissioners to oversee the care of the state's wounded soldiers in February 1863. After securing sufficient medical supplies for the wounded, Blackburn traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to meet with Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon and offered to serve as General Inspector of Hospitals and Camps without taking compensation or a rank. When the offer was refused, Governor Pettus asked Blackburn to travel to Canada to collect provisions for blockade runners there. Blackburn and his wife left Mississippi for Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August 1863, then continued on to Toronto (in what was then the Province of Canada) where they lodged in a boardinghouse. On one occasion, Blackburn was aboard a blockade running ship carrying ice from Halifax to Mobile, Alabama, when the ship was captured by the Union Navy. Union officials assumed Blackburn was a civilian passenger on the vessel and released him, after which he returned to Canada.|$|E

Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts.
