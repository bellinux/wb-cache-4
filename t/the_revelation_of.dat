5|$|Goldschmidt's {{appointment}} was initially {{expected to meet}} with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt's involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings {{he and his wife}} had with Texas Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as an outspoken critic of Goldschmidt. The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt's career, including reporters' difficulties accessing records from his time as governor, ultimately led to <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> an illegal sexual relationship with a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his time as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt's extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking.|$|E
5|$|In Colonel Redl, Brandauer plays Alfred Redl, {{counter-intelligence}} {{chief of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire who was blackmailed into espionage for the Russians {{in order to prevent}} <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> his homosexuality. The film won top awards in Germany and the UK, but provoked a scandal in Austria, where several periodicals accused the film of bringing the country into disrepute. In Hanussen, Brandauer plays the real life clairvoyant performer Erik Jan Hanussen, whose growing fame brings him into increasingly close—and dangerous—contact with the Nazis.|$|E

Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> the Kir'Shara {{in a similar manner}} to the Catholic Church's suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code or James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in late October and early November 2007, {{primarily}} {{on the island of}} Oahu, where Lost is filmed. Several days before shooting, Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. His arrest prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. With <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> Sun as one of the Oceanic Six, all six members have been revealed. Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.|$|E
5|$|Upon <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> the character's {{new design}} as a cyborg ninja, writers noted how Raiden {{distanced himself from}} his {{previous}} appearance that imitated Solid Snake. They also emphasized how Raiden becomes {{a different type of}} game hero with a new, direct fighting style. Since Raiden has become more powerful than Solid Snake in physical strength and weaponry to the point of exaggeration, writers have compared him favorably to other popular game heroes and find his actions still in-character considering the fight scenes throughout the series.|$|E

5|$|A viral {{marketing}} campaign was employed for the film. After <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> the first teaser trailer, in August2009, the film's official website featured only an animation of Cobb's spinning top. In December, the top toppled {{over and the}} website opened the online game Mind Crime, which upon completion revealed Inceptions poster. The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had a QR code linking to an online manual of the device. Mind Crime also received a stage2 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie. More pieces of {{viral marketing}} began to surface before Inceptions release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to Wired magazine, and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film. Warner also released an online prequel comic, Inception: The Cobol Job.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E

They begin to engage sexually, but Charlie suddenly grows inexplicably uncomfortable and stops Sam. Charlie begins to realize that his sexual contact with Sam has stirred up repressed memories of him being molested by his Aunt Helen as a little boy.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Revelations</b> <b>of</b> Gla'aki first {{appeared}} in Ramsey Campbell's short story [...] "The Inhabitant of the Lake" [...] (1964). It was written by the undead cult worshipping the Great Old One Gla'aki. Whenever Gla'aki slept, {{the members of his}} cult had periods of free will, and, since they were part of Gla'aki and shared his memories, they wrote down what they remembered of their master's thoughts. The cult's handwritten manuscripts later {{came to be known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Revelations</b> <b>of</b> Gla'aki. <b>The</b> text originally contained eleven volumes,nine in the carefully abridged published edition, but it may have had more at different times in the past. [...] Rumor has it that Mythos Scholar, Antonius Quine, once published a corrected edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Revelations</b> <b>of</b> Gla'aki bound in a single volume.|$|R
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> {{the illegal}} activities, {{expenditures}} had been routinely {{made on a}} cash basis, all of the university funding and program money was thrown into a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated. The new leadership had to advertise in Louisiana newspapers to find out to whom they owed money. The first year {{of dealing with the}} situation required 16- to 18-hour days, six days a week, and after that the process still required overtime through the year 1941. Faculty and staff members, accustomed to making purchases without bids, purchase orders or knowledge of the budget, had to be educated on the accepted business procedures on which {{the rest of the world}} operated.|$|E
5|$|Following an eighth-place {{finish in}} the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to {{temporarily}} resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; {{by that time the}} trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.|$|E
5|$|Iris Crowe is {{the older}} sister of Brother Justin and a devoted {{supporter}} of his ministry duties in California. Iris' {{significance in the}} series starts when Brother Justin informs her about the church board's plan to take away his new ministry. Shortly after, {{a fire in the}} church kills several orphans, but it remains unknown {{until the end of the}} first season that Iris was the arsonist. Radio show host Tommy Dolan, who arrived to help with the arson investigation, develops feelings for Iris, but a romance is hindered by Brother Justin's return from a week-long self-discovery trip. Dolan starts to uncover evidence pointing to Iris's guilt, but a strange twist at Iris's planned public confession results in Dolan's arrest as the culprit. To prevent <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> Brother Justin's true nature, Iris murders an innocent Okie, Eleanor. Late in the second season, Iris joins her foster father Norman in an ultimately unsuccessful plot against Brother Justin.|$|E

The Sith Lords reveals she as Sith trained two antagonists of the game, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, before they cast her out.

5|$|Symeon's {{theological}} and ethical treatises were original written works, {{as compared to}} many of his other writings that were taken from his talks. They cover his positions on various controversial issues of theology. Many of them were directed at Stephen, his main antagonist in the church, along with other church officials whom Symeon saw as taking an overly theoretical approach to Christianity. In these pieces Symeon defended {{the traditions of the}} early Byzantine mystical theologians from the teachings of the church officials of his own time. Central to this defense was Symeon's view that <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> scripture could only be understood through the experience of divine grace given to the pure of heart during contemplation.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, {{believed}} to have been written in 1610–11, and thought by many critics to be the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone. It is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, rightful Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and skillful manipulation. He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to cause his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to believe they are shipwrecked and marooned on the island. There, his machinations bring about <b>the</b> <b>revelation</b> <b>of</b> Antonio's lowly nature, the redemption of the King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.|$|E
