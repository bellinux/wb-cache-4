He had {{previously}} co-developed the stories for the second season episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "Anasazi" [...] - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes [...] "Avatar" [...] and [...] "Talitha Cumi". As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode.

[...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E

However, this is disputed. An article in [...] "Russian Life" [...] writes, [...] "Today the Soviet reality is discussed, there are stories about food shortages. This {{is one of the}} most persistent, propagandistic cliches... It is necessary to say that in reality, nothing of the sort happened. Starting in 1979, when I was seven, my mother regularly <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm market in Butyrsky. The abundance of groceries at the market left me with a strong impression. I remember fresh meat for 3-5 rubles per kg, potatoes at 20 kopecki, and pineapples and watermelons in mid-winter." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2017 Edmonds said he {{attempted}} suicide after fraud {{by a group}} of HBOS financiers destroyed his Unique Group business: [...] "Until these criminals <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink of emotional annihilation, I had always felt those who opt out by taking their own lives were selfish and cowardly... But having been cast into that bottomless dark space devoid of logic and reason, I have a much deeper understanding of life without hope... I seek no sympathy and feel no shame in admitting that on the evening of January 18th 2005 I attempted to end the overwhelming mental pain which had consumed my whole being." [...] He also blamed HBOS for his prostate cancer, saying, [...] "I am absolutely sure the negative forces acting on me impacted on my health...

The men were well armed with pistols, rifles and shotguns. McMaster wore two cartridge belts. Allie wore Virgil's pistol belt during the journey so it would be handy. Virgil told the San Francisco Examiner two months later that upon getting off the train in Tucson, [...] "Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth." [...] "They fell back into the crowd as soon as they saw I had an escort, and the boys <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel to supper." [...] Guarded by his brothers and the deputies, Virgil and Allie had dinner at Porter's Hotel in Tucson. Their guards helped them board the train for California, and once they were safely seated, kept a watch for the Cowboys.|$|E
