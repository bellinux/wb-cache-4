40|$|<b>The</b> <b>unfolded</b> state {{ensemble}} of proteins {{has been described}} as a structurally featureless state. While this approach is supported by the fact that many <b>unfolded</b> proteins follow <b>the</b> scaling law behavior of a random coil, there is evidence that <b>the</b> <b>unfolded</b> states of various proteins are stabilized by native or non-native interactions. Recently, the existence of extensive non-native structure was reported for a repeat protein, which resulted in a scaling law exponent that is significantly smaller than that of a random polymer [Cortajarena et al., J.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the role}} of electrostatics in protein {{stability}} requires knowledge of these interactions in both <b>the</b> folded and <b>unfolded</b> states. Electrostatic interactions can be probed experimentally by characterizing ionization equilibria of titrating groups, parameterized as pKa values. However, pKa values of <b>the</b> <b>unfolded</b> state are rarely accessible under native conditions, where <b>the</b> <b>unfolded</b> state has a very low population. Here, we report pKa values under nondenaturing conditions for two <b>unfolded</b> fragments of <b>the</b> protein G B 1 domain that mimic <b>the</b> <b>unfolded</b> state of <b>the</b> intact protein. pKa values were determined for carboxyl groups by monitoring their pH-dependent 13 C chemical shifts. Monte Carlo simulations using a Gaussian chain model provide corrections for changes in electrostatic interactions that arise from fragmentation of the protein. Most pKa values for <b>the</b> <b>unfolded</b> state agree well with model values, but some residues show significant perturbations that can be rationalized by local electrostatic interactions. The pH-dependent stability was calculated from the experimental pKa values of <b>the</b> folded and <b>unfolded</b> states and compared to experimental stability data.

After sampling over all conformations, the electrostatic interaction energy between two charged residues (separated by l peptide bonds) is given by W = 332 (6 /π) 1 / 2 [1 − π 1 / 2 xexp(x 2) erfc(x) ]/ɛd, where d = bl 1 / 2 + s and x = κd/ 61 / 2.

The morale and discipline of the indigenous forces had sunk so low that they began to leave their defensive positions without permission, although their section of the camp was never subjected to a major ground attack. Consequently, the behavior of indigenous CIDG soldiers during the various stages of the battle, coupled with information that 'friendly' Montagnard soldiers had turned on U.S. Marines at Ngok Tavak, had the effect of unnerving U.S. Army soldiers in Khâm Đức.

5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, <b>the</b> <b>unfolding</b> process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation.
