BITS 3.0 also uses Internet Gateway Device counters to more accurately calculate available bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|Note: When tee is {{used with}} a pipe, {{the output of the}} {{previous}} command is written to a <b>temporary</b> <b>file.</b> When that command finishes, tee reads the <b>temporary</b> <b>file,</b> displays the output, and writes it to the file(s) given as command-line argument.|$|E

50|$|Some {{programs}} create <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> {{and then}} leave them behind - they do not delete them. This can happen because the program crashed or the developer of the program simply forgot to add the code needed to delete the <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> after the program is done with them. The <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> left behind can accumulate over time and consume a lot of disk space.|$|R

50|$|While a {{data set}} is being edited by a user, <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> {{are created by}} MapInfo Professional. The {{presence}} {{of any of these}} files locks the data set and prevents it from being edited by any other users. When the changes are saved, the <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> are deleted by the software. In certain situations such as a power failure while editing is in progress, the <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> may not be deleted and the changes will be lost. In this case the files should be manually deleted.|$|R

50|$|Most {{operating}} systems offer primitives such as pipes, sockets or shared memory {{to pass data}} among programs, but often the simplest way (especially for programs that follow the Unix philosophy) is to write data into a <b>temporary</b> <b>file</b> and inform the receiving program of {{the location of the}} <b>temporary</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E

25|$|This {{mechanism}} is defeated, however, if an application often deletes and recreates <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> as {{the operating system}} would then try to maintain the integrity of void data effectively causing more fragmentation in the end. In some DOS versions, the usage of a special API function to create <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> {{can be used to}} avoid this problem.|$|R

50|$|The {{directory}} /tmp is world-writable. Malicious user Mallory {{creates a}} symbolic {{link to the}} file /root/.rhosts named /tmp/foo. Then, Mallory invokes foo with user as the requested account. The program creates the (<b>temporary)</b> <b>file</b> /tmp/foo (really creating /root/.rhosts) and puts information about the requested account (e.g. user password) in it. It removes the <b>temporary</b> <b>file</b> (merely removing the symbolic link).|$|E

Each logged in user has a private <b>temporary</b> <b>filing</b> name space which cannot be seen by any other logged in user (nor even another logged in user with the same username). A user's <b>temporary</b> <b>files</b> are deleted when the user logs out (and implicitly if the system is rebooted).
