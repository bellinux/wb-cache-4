5|$|As a {{newly elected}} Senator, Owen campaigned {{actively}} {{on behalf of}} William Jennings Bryan {{in the presidential election}} of 1908; <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> to remain political allies for many years.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} leader, {{he worked}} fruitlessly alongside William Abraham {{to resolve the}} 1910–11 Cambrian Combine dispute, after <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> shunned by the more radical miners' leaders. Although espousing Gladstonian Liberalism and opposing the affiliation of The Miners' Federation of Great Britain to the Labour Party, Watts Morgan joined the more radical and Marxist Plebs' League {{and sat on the}} board of governors for the Central Labour College.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{served in}} the U.S. Army in the War of 1812 under William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of the Indiana Territory. Both from Virginia families, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> close in age. Hinde was made responsible for prisoners of war starting in 1813, {{when he was about}} 27 or 28 years old.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>was</b> electrical. They sprang up, filled with superstitious horror, and fled precipitately from the cave.|$|R
5|$|The Texas Tornado {{held the}} Intercontinental Championship {{for almost three}} months before {{dropping}} it back to Perfect on November 19. The match was aired on the December 15 edition of WWF Superstars. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> also on opposite sides for an elimination match at Survivor Series. Perfect eliminated the Tornado with a PerfectPlex, but the Tornado's team won the match. Brutus Beefcake did not wrestle again until 1993.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} Raw brand feud {{was between}} Shawn Michaels and Edge. Their feud started at Taboo Tuesday 2004 when Michaels was voted over Edge to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. At New Year's Revolution 2005, Edge lost {{a shot at}} the title in an Elimination Chamber with Michaels as special referee. In the Elimination Chamber, Michaels superkicked Edge, followed by a lionsault from Chris Jericho, with Jericho making the cover. Believing it was Michael's fault that he was not crowned champion, Edge speared Michaels and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> booked into a match at Royal Rumble.|$|E
5|$|Cascioferro is {{considered}} to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, Joseph Petrosino, on March 12, 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from the crime scene. Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> very much aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascioferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascioferro had a photograph of the police officer.|$|E

5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and bribery. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> so protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils {{to prevent them from}} falling into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E
5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting {{a complaint against}} London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics, an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect {{the views of the}} London bid.|$|E
60|$|I {{think the}} astonishment of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>was</b> beyond any vocal expression. Without a word, the drunken {{stranger}} {{got into the}} wagon, and drove away.|$|R

5|$|In 1305, Edward and {{his father}} quarrelled, {{probably}} {{over the issue of}} money. The Prince had an altercation with Bishop Walter Langton, who served as the royal treasurer, apparently over the amount of financial support Edward received from the Crown. Edward I defended his treasurer, and banished his son and his companions from his court, cutting off their financial support. After some negotiations involving family members and friends, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> reconciled.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|Talbot and de Lacy then {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the town of Bath. While scouting, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> attacked by forces from the city, and Talbot was captured by forces {{under the control of the}} bishop of Bath, Robert of Lewes. The Empress' forces then arranged a parley with the bishop and offered him a safe conduct, but when the bishop showed up at the meeting, he was threatened with hanging unless Talbot was released. The bishop released Talbot under duress. The release affected the bishop's relations with Stephen, who accused the bishop of supporting Matilda, and was only with difficulty persuaded to accept the bishop's explanation.|$|E
60|$|The {{greeting}} between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>was</b> cold, and <b>the</b> Prince {{almost immediately}} stepped between them. Nevertheless, Brott {{seemed to have}} a fancy to talk with Mr. Sabin.|$|R

5|$|The {{death of}} U.S. Representative John Clopton in September 1816 created a vacancy in Virginia's 23rd congressional district. Tyler sought the seat, as did {{his friend and}} {{political}} ally Andrew Stevenson. Since <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> politically alike, the race was {{for the most part}} a popularity contest. Tyler's political connections and campaigning skills narrowly won him the election. He was sworn into the Fourteenth Congress on December 17, 1816, to serve as a Democratic-Republican, the major political party in the Era of Good Feelings.|$|E
5|$|The {{posters of}} Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day {{a member of}} the public came forward to provide {{information}} about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present.|$|E
5|$|Three Taliban {{fighters were}} in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed the wounds of the two soldiers.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Horser {{leaned over}} the table. His eyes were bloodshot, his tone was fierce and threatening. Mr. Sabin was coldly courteous. The {{difference}} between the demeanour of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>was</b> remarkable.|$|R

5|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Cousy {{published his}} autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963, {{and in the}} same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91-86 in the title game, when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy's teammate at Holy Cross when <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
