5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union, all B-52Gs {{remaining}} in service were destroyed in accordance with the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). The Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMRC) cut the 365 B-52G bombers into pieces.

5|$|Breckinridge's {{personal}} turmoil did not hinder {{his political}} accomplishments. He was appointed superintendent {{of public education}} by Governor William Owsley. He was the sixth person to hold the office since its creation in the 1830s. The <b>task</b> <b>was</b> daunting. Only one of every ten school-age children in Kentucky ever attended school, and at least thirty Kentucky counties had received no state educational funds since 1840.|$|E
5|$|Béla {{appointed}} his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich Ban of Macsó (Mačva, Serbia) in 1254. Rostislav's <b>task</b> <b>was</b> {{the creation}} of a buffer zone along the southern borders.

Finally the lowest level <b>tasks</b> <b>are</b> conducted as necessary in a repetitive manner.|$|R
5|$|During the {{funerals}} of Soviet leaders {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin. This <b>task</b> <b>was</b> traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had {{more than two hundred}} decorations, several were placed on each cushion. Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.|$|E

5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its <b>task</b> <b>was</b> to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E

5|$|The border clearers' <b>task</b> <b>was</b> aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both}} sides of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed to fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was often}} a hazardous task because {{of the necessity of}} flying at slow speeds and at low altitude. The <b>task</b> <b>was</b> made all the more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons, including Manfred von Richthofen's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11, which led to a sharp increase in RFC losses. Although significantly outnumbering the Germans, the RFC lost 131 aircraft {{during the first week of}} April (Bloody April). Despite the losses suffered by the RFC, the Luftstreitkräfte failed to prevent the British from carrying out its priority, air support of the army during the Battle of Arras with up-to-date aerial photographs and other reconnaissance information.|$|E
