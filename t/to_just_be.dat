5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E

Meanwhile, Henry treats Violet to dinner and a movie at Granny's and she is impressed, but when the subject of dating or courting came up, Violet tells Henry that she wants <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> friends, but explains {{that it was not}} because of her father's disapproval of him. This devastated Henry because he is not a hero in this universe. He is consoled by Regina, who then takes Henry's teardrop to Emma and tells Henry he just found a way to save Emma.|$|E

500|$|Both the {{physical}} appearance {{and behavior of}} Henry and Sam were designed to reflect that of Joel and Ellie; the backpack and jeans worn by both duos reflect {{the physical}} resemblance, while the behavioral resemblance was {{in that they are}} both forced to make tough decisions over time. After Brandon Scott was chosen to portray Henry, the team only showed him some artistic sketches of the game, avoiding specific details about the story. Scott enjoyed portraying the character, particularly {{due to the fact that}} he was allowed to introduce elements of his own personality. [...] "You don't have to plan ... because you get <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> the character," [...] Scott said. He also felt that recording the voice and actions simultaneously was [...] "exciting" [...] and helpful.

Druckmann stated that Henry and Sam's relationship mirrored that of Joel and Ellie's. Ellie was seen by the team as a mentor to Sam. Johnson felt that Sam was [...] "genuinely scared", admiring this significant difference from the game's other characters.|$|E

500|$|The unique contortions of the Gangers were {{achieved}} through computer-generated imagery done by The Mill. It was originally planned that Jennifer would eat Buzzer, but The Mill decided only {{the shadows of}} the action would be shown on the wall. All of this was cut from the final episode, with the exception of Jennifer's elongated mouth as she advanced towards him. The pile of discarded Jennifer Gangers was originally intended <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a pile of bodies, but it was decided that would be [...] "too grim". Instead, life-sized dolls were used and computer-generated Flesh was painted on it, giving it a more melted look. The monster Jennifer transforms into at the end was created with CGI and a photo of pop singer Madonna was used as reference, as in the image [...] "here arms were...really sinewy, white, veiny, and fleshy". Graham wanted the creature to have a real face and an alien body; he was inspired by a drawing in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that depicted Alice with a long neck. Sarah Smart was filmed in front of a greenscreen maneuvering like the monster, which was used as reference.|$|E

[...] Shubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express thought that the film was [...] "too explanatory, too talky", and that [...] "the most effective moments in the film occur when the two leads are allowed to fall silent, <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> in that moment, to loosen up". While lauding the film's treatment of the subject matter, Gupta described Waiting as [...] "a film about life, lasting love and impending loss which explores a zone Bollywood doesn't bother with".|$|E
500|$|Small {{pieces of}} paper were sprayed as snow, which caused a problem as it scared the horses. However, the snow falling from {{the sky was a}} foam substance. The actors who played the dead bodies possessed by the Gelth had simple make-up, with just shading and contact lenses and no prosthetics. The {{production}} team was mindful of the programme's audience, and decided to not have any missing facial features. Originally, visual effects company The Mill planned the computer-generated effects (CGI) <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> the [...] "ethereal swirl", but in the seance scene they ran into the challenge of animating the Gelth's mouth. The Gelth turning red during the seance scene was a [...] "last-minute" [...] change to the visual effects. The Mill overshot their quota of CGI for the episode, and compensated with small swirls in shots that focused on other characters. The head speaking was in fact actress Zoe Thorne, who had been filmed separately and used as a template for animation. In other scenes, Thorne had the challenge of matching her voice-overs to the actors who portrayed the bodies animated by the Gelth.|$|E
