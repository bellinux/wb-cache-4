5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E

5|$|On August 21, 1989, the 1/ weekday skip-stop service started. The {{plan was}} to have skip-stop service begin north of 116th Street–Columbia University, but due to objections, most notably that riders did not want 125th Street to be a skip-stop station, skip-stop service was only {{implemented}} north of 137th Street–City College between <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 6:30am and 7:00pm. All 1 trains skipped Marble Hill–225th, 207th, 191st and 145th Streets, while all 9 trains skipped 238th, 215th, Dyckman and 157th Streets. On September 4, 1994, midday skip-stop service was discontinued, and 191st Street {{was no longer a}} skip-stop station.|$|E
5|$|Rolin {{was aware}} of the liturgy {{associated}} with the Mass for the Dead, and would have known Last Judgement scenes associated with the Mass from 15th-century illuminated manuscripts, such as the full-page Last Judgement in <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> Catherine of Cleves which shows Christ placed in a similar position, sitting above as the dead rise from the ground.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> {{sale for}} {{on-premises}} consumption are regulated by local ordinance, and closing times vary by town. Atlantic City {{does not have}} closing hours, and alcohol {{can be purchased at}} its casinos and local bars 24 hours a day. With the exception of Newark and Jersey City, the law forbids hard liquor packaged goods sales before 9 am and after 10 pm any day of the week. This can be restricted further by local ordinance. Liquor stores may sell beer and wine during any hours that on-premises sales are allowed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolf is {{that hour}} around 3 a.m. when you can't sleep because you're worried {{about one thing}} or another. Ivanova says that she's been living in <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolf since Sheridan {{disappeared}} on Z'ha'dum.|$|R
5000|$|The {{significance}} of performing Ushitora Gongyo {{at this time}} of day derives from earlier Buddhist teachings that describe <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ox as [...] "the end of darkness" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiger as [...] "the beginning of light," [...] and ones that describe all Buddhas as having attained enlightenment at this time. The passage from <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ox to <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiger therefore symbolizes the transition from the unenlightened condition of a common mortal to the enlightened condition of a Buddha, so the performance of gongyo at this hour serves as a reminder of the true purpose of Buddhist practice: to achieve enlightenment in this lifetime.|$|R
50|$|The {{action of}} the drama {{is divided into three}} episodes — <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> love, <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> despair and <b>the</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> admonition. <b>The</b> book shows dangers of people's romantic nature and reading sentimental masterpieces, which do not show the real world. On the other hand, Gustaw is {{presented}} as an owner of the methaphysical knowledge. It is him, not his teacher who eventually notions to the philosophy of Enlightenment and visualises the true picture of the world, which is the reality conducted by paranormal laws.|$|R
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of friendly fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Moran {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication. He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times {{over the next few weeks}} on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.|$|E
5|$|Large {{trucks and}} buses require a {{commercial}} driver's license (CDL) to operate. Obtaining a CDL requires extra {{education and training}} dealing with the special knowledge requirements and handling characteristics of such a large vehicle. Drivers of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) must adhere to <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> service, which are regulations governing the driving hours of commercial drivers. These and all other rules regarding the safety of interstate commercial driving are issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The FMCSA is {{a division of the}} United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), which governs all transportation-related industries such as trucking, shipping, railroads, and airlines. Some other issues are handled by another branch of the USDOT, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).|$|E

5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Other divine {{groups were}} {{composed}} of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented {{a region of}} the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> {{the day and night}} and for each nome (province) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, symbolically important number of deities. Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light-producing, and Osiris, who is static and shrouded in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four connote completeness. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others: Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers (the major cities of Thebes, Heliopolis, and Memphis) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added to this group, which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was {{responsible}} for the defence of the northern perimeter of the ANZAC beach-head, holding a sector from the position known as Walker's Top down the ridge line to the sea. Part of this defence line was formed by No.1 and No.2 Posts, isolated positions in the far north that could only be approached in safety during <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> darkness. Near the end of May 1915, the Turks started constructing a new position just inland from No.2 Post, that if left to be completed would cause problems for the New Zealanders. Therefore, it was decided to assault and capture the post. After the position was captured, it was named No.3 Post, and the New Zealanders settled in and attempted to improve its defences. The same night, the Turks counter-attacked. Surrounded and cut {{off from the rest of}} the brigade, running short of ammunition and supplies, the defending 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron held out for twenty-eight hours until relieved, and beat off several attempts to break through their lines. When the squadron was eventually relieved it was decided the post was untenable, and it was abandoned the same night.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Code is {{a one-hour}} {{introduction}} to computer science organized by Code. org, a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science. This study investigated <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Code on students’ attitudes towards computer programming and {{their knowledge of}} programming. A sample of undergraduate students from two universities was selected to participate. Participants completed an <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Code tutorial {{as part of an}} undergraduate course. An electronic questionnaire was implemented in a pre-survey and post-survey format to gauge the change in student attitudes toward programming and their programming ability. The findings indicated the positive impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Code tutorial on students’ attitude toward programming. However, the students’ programming skills did not significantly change. The authors suggest that a deeper alignment of marketing, teaching, and content would help sustain the type of initiative exemplified by <b>the</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>of</b> Code...|$|R

5|$|Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque {{in the late}} twelfth century, {{retaining}} and reviving elements of its style after the Gothic had become dominant elsewhere from the thirteenth century. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and of the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors like the sacrament houses at Deskford and Kinkell and the carvings of the seven deadly sins at Rosslyn Chapel. From the thirteenth century, there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies like the elaborate Douglas tombs {{in the town of}} Douglas. Native craftsmanship can be seen in items like the Bute mazer and the Savernake Horn, and more widely in the large number of high quality seals that survive from the mid thirteenth century onwards. Visual illustration {{can be seen in the}} illumination of charters, and occasional survivals like the fifteenth century Doom painting at Guthrie. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, including Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh and <b>the</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> James IV of Scotland.|$|E
