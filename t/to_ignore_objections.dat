It sought articles from non-Jews promoting Zionism {{as a solution}} to the [...] "Jewish question", and remained largely uncritically focussed on the positive aspects of the aspiration, tending <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> <b>objections.</b> Controversy was created by an extremely aggressive article by Nordau attacking the cultural Zionist Ahad Ha'am, who had challenged Herzl's vision. Nordau's abusive language, calling Ha'am [...] "crippled, hunchbacked" [...] and the [...] "despised slave of intolerant knout-wielding pogromchiks", caused outrage among Jewish nationalists and Zionists.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{any attempt}} to recuse a judge from hearing a case on the ground of a {{conflict}} of interest must be based on credible grounds, and must not be motivated by any extraneous purpose. Otherwise, the rule could become a charter for abuse by manipulative advocates. A judge [...] "would be as wrong to yield to a tenuous or frivolous objection as he would <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> an <b>objection</b> of substance".|$|R

In the development of the narrative, the intended marriage was shown to be part of God's plan to strike at the Philistines.|$|R

This time, her letters received attention, and the Indian Office responded to her {{within a week of}} the original letters, informing her that Taylor had been ordered <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> Peter Picotte's <b>objections.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{a minute}} to the Cabinet's Defence and Overseas Policy {{committee}} the following month, Lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations: first, to ensure Britain didn't have to join the single currency; second, to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight; and third, to ensure that during the period {{in the run-up to}} the single currency, there should be no binding obligations on Britain. [...] In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: [...] "I can't see what you are so worked up about. We are in the ERM. What difference does it make if it is in the Treaty?" [...] Lamont decided <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> their <b>objections.</b> At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation. As a result, the meeting agreed to remove it.|$|R
2500|$|Imputed bias {{was also}} {{referred}} to in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), which involved {{the issue of whether}} the President exercises the power of clemency in his personal discretion or whether he is required to act upon the Cabinet's advice. The appellant argued that Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, {{who was a member of}} the Court of Appeal hearing the matter, ought to be automatically disqualified. According to the appellant, this was because the Chief Justice had previously been the Attorney-General, and as such, must have advised the President on the scope of his discretion. The implication of the appellant's submission was that the Chief Justice would have to decide the case against the appellant to cover up any negligence in his advice to the President. The Court endorsed the principle of judicial disqualification in the case of a personal interest, stating that [...] "where a judge is personally interested in the outcome of the case before him, he will not be able to give an impartial and objective judgment on the case. If he were to be allowed to adjudicate on the case notwithstanding this risk, that would, without more, undermine public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice." [...] It went on to reject the applicant's argument based on the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Locabail that a judge [...] "would be as wrong to yield to a tenuous or frivolous objection as he would <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> an <b>objection</b> of substance". In the Court's view, the disqualification application was frivolous and appeared to be motivated to diminish the judicial process such that a fresh hearing had to be convened. In addition, the central premise of the application– that the President could have acted in his own discretion in exercising the clemency power– was implausible.|$|R

25|$|Following his arrest, the United States {{pressured}} the Yugoslav government to extradite Milošević to the ICTY or lose financial {{aid from the}} IMF and World Bank. President Koštunica opposed extradition of Milošević, arguing that it would violate the Yugoslav Constitution. Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić called an extraordinary meeting {{of the government to}} issue a decree for extradition. Milošević's lawyers appealed the extradition process to the Yugoslav Constitutional Court. The court requested 2 weeks to deliberate the appeal. <b>Ignoring</b> <b>objections</b> from the president and the constitutional court, Đinđić ordered the extradition of Milošević to the ICTY. On 28 June, Milošević was flown by helicopter from Belgrade to the U.S. air base in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina from where he was then flown to The Hague, Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|Corrupt {{members of}} {{national}} governments may collude with resource extraction companies to override their own laws and <b>ignore</b> <b>objections</b> made by indigenous inhabitants. The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee report entitled [...] "Petroleum and Poverty Paradox" [...] states that [...] "too often, oil money that {{should go to}} a nation’s poor {{ends up in the}} pockets of the rich, or it may be squandered on grand palaces and massive showcase projects instead of being invested productively". A 2016 study finds that mining in Africa substantially increases corruption; an individual within 50 kilometers of a recently opened mine is 33% more likely to have paid a bribe the past year than a person living within 50 kilometers of mines that will open in the future. The former also pay bribes for permits more frequently, and perceive their local councilors to be more corrupt.|$|R
50|$|The {{operations}} at Odessa highlighted significant {{weaknesses in the}} Romanian Army, leading both military and political leaders {{in the country to}} call for a discontinuation of military operations against the Soviet Union.
