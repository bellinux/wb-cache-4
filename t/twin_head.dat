2500|$|It was at Tenedos, {{along with}} Lesbos, {{that the first}} coins with Greek writing on them were minted. Figures of bunches of grapes and wine vessels such as amphorae and kantharoi were stamped on coins. The very first coins had a <b>twin</b> <b>head</b> of a male and a female on the obverse side. The early coins were of silver and had a double-headed axe {{imprinted}} on them. Aristotle considered the axe as symbolizing the decapitation of those convicted of adultery, a Tenedian decree. The axe-head was either a religious symbol or the seal of a trade unit of currency. Apollo Smintheus, a god who both protected against and brought about plague, was worshipped in late Bronze Age Tenedos. Strabo's Geography writes that Tenedos [...] "contains an Aeolian city and has two harbours, and a temple of Apollo Smintheus" [...] (Strabo's Geography, Vol. 13). The relationship between Tenedos and Apollo is mentioned in Book I of the Iliad where a priest calls to Apollo with the name [...] "O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might"(Iliad I).|$|E

50|$|Craniopagus parasiticus is an {{extremely}} rare type of parasitic twinning occurring in about 4 to 6 of 10,000,000 births.

2500|$|For {{otherwise}} healthy twin pregnancies where both <b>twins</b> are <b>head</b> down {{a trial of}} vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.

Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet Nicander seems to contradict this by describing it as [...] "always dull of eye".

Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for either infant as compared with caesarean section. [...] There is some controversy on the best method of delivery where the first <b>twin</b> is <b>head</b> first {{and the second is}} not, but most obstetricians will recommend normal delivery unless there are other reasons to avoid vaginal birth. When the first <b>twin</b> is not <b>head</b> down, a caesarean section is often recommended. Regardless of whether the twins are delivered by section or vaginally, the medical literature recommends delivery of dichorionic twins at 38 weeks, and monochorionic twins (identical twins sharing a placenta) by 37 weeks due to the increased risk of stillbirth in monochorionic twins who remain in utero after 37 weeks. [...] The consensus is that late preterm delivery of monochorionic twins is justified because the risk of stillbirth for post-37 week delivery is significantly higher than the risks posed by delivering monochorionic twins near term (i.e., 36–37 weeks).|$|R
