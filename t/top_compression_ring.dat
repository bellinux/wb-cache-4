This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats {{the cylinder}} walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a rebore to an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons.

The losses in an internal combustion engine are dominated by thermal and parasitic sources.

40|$|Faced with {{increasing}} concern for lubricating, oil consumption and engine friction, {{it is critical}} to understand the oil transport mechanisms in the power cylinder system. Lubricating oil travels through distinct regions along the piston ring pack before being consumed in the combustion chamber, with the oil distribution and dominant driving forces varying substantially for each of these regions. This experimental work focuses on specific regions in the piston ring pack. A detailed 2 D LIF (Two Dimensional Laser Induced Fluorescence) study has been performed on the oil distribution observed with the LIF generated real time high-resolution images, as were changes in piston and ring design. The results reveal the third land, located between the second <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> and the oil control ring, oil flow patterns and timing are consistent and predictable at each operating point. Speed and load variation alter the basic flow pattern and oil balance through a corresponding change in inertia and gas dragging effect respectively, with ring design variation instigating specific and repeatable phenomenon onto the consistent oil flow pattern. Second land, the region between the <b>top</b> two <b>compression</b> <b>rings,</b> geometric and flow patterns throughout the entire cycle of a single cylinder spark ignition engine. The impact of speed and load were experimentally changes were found to {{have a significant impact on}} inertia driven oil transport; however, their effects on oil consumption were not as clear. As the majority of lubricating oil consumed in the engine crosses the third land at some point, an understanding of the timing and magnitude of the oil transport processes will allow means to be specifically developed to reduce the net oil flow across the third land(cont.) towards the combustion chamber. This work forms a foundation for developing oil control strategies for the third land and for identifying how and when oil reaches the upper piston ring pack regions that directly contribute to oil consumption. The ability to control, or impact, oil transport on the piston ring pack will have an impact on all engine classes, including engines in the maritime community. This experiment study is directly comparable to small marine engines, and can be used to help reduce maritime exhaust emissions related to lubrication consumption; additionally, this approach would be much more rugged and cost effective then other current technological improvements being investigated. Were a similar 2 D LIF experiment to be performed on large slow speed diesel engifes, the annual savings per vessel, assuming only a 10 % reduction in lube oil consumption was achieved, could amount to $ 30, 000 as cylinder lube oil is one of the most expensive operating costs for large slow speed diesel engines. by Adam Vokac.

The automotive industry is subject to increasing pressure to reduce the CO emissions and improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines. Improvements may be achieved {{in a number of}} ways. The parasitic losses throughout the engine cycle emanate from friction in all engine contact conjunctions in addition to pumping losses. In particular one main contributory conjunction is the piston ring pack assembly. At low engine speeds, the contribution of friction to the total losses within the engine is increased significantly compared with the thermodynamic losses. Additionally, the sealing capability of the ring is crucial in determining the power output of the engine with any loss of sealing contributing to power loss, as well as blowby. Most reported studies on compression ring-cylinder conjunction do not take into account complex ring in-plane and out-of-plane elastodynamics. Hitherto, {{there has not been a}} numerical methodology which integrates tribology of an elastic compression ring, subject to modal behaviour in a coupled solution.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the International Journal of Engine Research: [URL] piston ring/cylinder liner conjunction can experience various regimes of lubrication during piston strokes inside the engine cylinder. In the current engines, the nature of lubrication usually remains hydrodynamic at mid-stroke whilst a mixed regime of lubrication may be experienced at and near reversals. The direct contact between the tips {{of some of the}} asperities of opposing surfaces leads to mixed (partial) regime of lubrication. A model proposed by Greenwood and Tripp can be used to predict asperity level contribution to the total piston friction. At the same time Reynolds equation can be employed to predict the portion of load carried by the lubricant trapped between the asperities. Friction between the asperity tips is usually proportional to the load that they support; stated in terms of a proportionality factor; i. e. coefficient of friction. The surfaces are usually furnished with hard wear resistant coatings and in parts by solid lubricants. Both the piston rings and cylinder liner surfaces are usually coated. These coatings change the friction characteristics of the counterfaces because of their surface topography as well as material mechanical properties. AFM is used to obtain surface topographical parameters in contact tapping mode. The corresponding surface topographical parameters are obtained from representative regional areas of the contacting solid surfaces, using a Talysurf. The combination of topography and coating characteristics are used to develop the necessary parameters for a boundary friction model.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. One {{of the key}} conjunctions in the IC engine is that made by the <b>top</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> to the {{cylinder}} liner. Although the compression ring has seen considerable improvements since its introduction into steam engines by John Ramsbottom in the 1850 s, its multiple and often contradictory functions still remain a challenge today. The primary aim {{has always been to}} seal the combustion chamber and guard against leakage of combustion gasses. The ring is also required to conduct some of the generated heat away. These requirements call for good ring-bore conformance, but often at the expense of increased friction. A simplified inter-ring gas flow model, as well as the measured chamber pressure using a Kistler pressure transducer is carried out under motored conditions to obtain the net gas pressure acting behind the ring. This and the elastic pressure as the result of ring restoring tension force in fitment constitute the contact load, which is usually carried by a mixed-hydrodynamic regime of lubrication. The conjunction pressures are treated as a combination of hydrodynamic generated pressures and asperity-pair interactions. The former is obtained by solution of two dimensional Reynolds equation, whilst the latter is determined assuming a Gaussian distribution of asperities on the counterfaces. Surface topography of the bounding solids; the compression ring and the liner are measured and used as appropriate statistical functions in the Greenwood and Tripp model. Using an analytical flow model, pressure acting behind the ring (on the inner periphery of the ring) is obtained, leading to the calculation of ring-bore friction. A floating liner is used to measure friction of piston and ringpack in situ. The characteristic of the predicted variations are compared with the measured data. However, a quantitative comparison is not possible as the measured data corresponds to all the conjunctions of piston system, including the oil control rings as well as the piston skirt.

40|$|The {{constant}} pursuit in {{the automotive}} industry to increase the engines performance, new solutions are always developed and tested to reduce the friction and increase the efficiency in the engine. One component that contributes to friction losses is the piston ring pack where the top compression stands for up to 40 %. This master thesis collaborated with Scania’s material science department Basic engine and covers the friction and wear of four different materials on the cylinder liner surface against the <b>top</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ring.</b> The four tested materials were grey cast iron with different honing quality and three atmospheric plasma sprayed coatings with titanium oxide, chromium oxide and Metco’s mixture F 2071 which is a stainless steel mixed with a ceramic. A martensitic steel piston ring with a chromium coated sliding surface was used for all the testing in the Cameron-Plint TE 77 test-rig. This is a pin-on-disc test method and the parameters used for testing is set to replicate the environment the ring is exposed to at the top dead centre. The test-rig has been in Scania’s possession {{for a long time}} and has not always given a satisfying result. An uneven contact between the ring and liner has been a problem resulting in only worn edges of the liner specimen. The piston ring holder was therefore redesigned to be able to adjust the radius of the ring. This allowed a good conformability between the ring and liner to be obtained. The tested materials were evaluated according to friction and wear. Friction was measured with the test-rig and the wear was calculated with surface profiles that were measured before and after testing. Worn surfaces were studied in a SEM to verify which wear mechanism that was active. The changes of the surfaces was studied with the use of following surface parameters Ra, Rk, Rpk, Rvk and if there was a connection between these parameters and friction and wear coefficient. Independent of honing quality showed the grey cast iron lowest friction coefficient just under 0. 13, the F 2071 liner showed a friction coefficient just above 0. 13. Both oxide layers showed similar friction where the chromium oxide had a friction just below 0. 15 and the titanium oxide lay just above 0. 15. Lowest wear coefficient had the chromium oxide followed by F 2071, titanium oxide and the bad honed grey cast iron. These three liners showed almost the exact same wear coefficient. Worst wear coefficient had the grey cast iron with a good honing quality. A mild abrasive wear mechanism was active during the wear test and vague wear marks was found on the surface.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to characterise piston ring lubrication in reciprocating test rigs and engines in terms of film thickness {{as a function of}} oil properties, reciprocating speed and load. A purpose-built test rig, which consists of a moving liner and a fixed piston ring, is used to measure the oil film thickness employing the capacitance and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques. The intensity of the fluorescent light measured as voltage is interpreted as film thickness through calibration. Ring profile fitting is being used as the standard calibration method, but also a dynamic technique has been proposed whereby a groove of known depth on a piston ring specimen is used to provide in-situ dynamic calibration, circumventing the uncertainties of oil film temperature and properties variation during the cycle. A micrometer based static calibration method is compared directly to the dynamic one. The power output of the fibres should be taken into account as well as background noise and resident voltage on the fluorescence detector. Extensive oil parametric studies have been conducted and oil film thickness, LIF, friction and oil film pressure measurements are presented and compared for different speed, load, temperature, lubricant type and piston-ring geometry. The goal of enhancing the repeatability of the parametric study was achieved through the different positioning of the capacitance transducer and through the increased rigidity of the simulation rig. Useful results were drawn and the effect of properties such as viscosity, viscosity index, HTHS, piston - ring curvature and ring "effective width" on film thickness, film pressure and friction could be determined. Viscosity remains an important factor. Oil flow visualisation using a CCD camera allowed observation of cavitation throughout the stroke through a glass liner. At mid-stroke the presence of string cavities was evident, whereas near the dead centres the initiation of cavitation was observed in the form of fern-shaped cavities at the diverging wedge of the piston ring specimen at all times. The cavities take the shape of ferns, grown ferns, fissures, strings and bubbles. The existence of the cavities, previously identified indirectly with the LIF technique, was further supported by measurements using a new aluminium liner which incorporates a miniature pressure transducer used for the first time for oil film pressure measurements and an optical fibre. The oil film pressure measurements provided further support to the interpretation of cavitation at different parts of the stroke. The transition between different cavitating conditions (from P vapour to P atm) previously identified in the minimum oil film thickness measurement signal was further supported by the addition of the glass liner and the pressure transducer. Eventually, an insight was obtained into the onset and development of cavitation in the piston assembly via the simulation test rig, which will encourage further efforts in modelling cavitation under a much wider range of operating conditions than those examined here. Engine testing under motoring conditions was conducted in a modified single cylinder engine with parts of the liner cut and fitted with quartz windows for visualisation experiments. Comparable cavity forms to the test rig were identified and an approach towards their formation is presented. It became clear that the numerous factors affecting the lubrication between the piston-rings and cylinder liner in the engine are giving a different picture compared to the single-ring test rig where the structures are more uniform and the transition fi-om one cavitation type to another is much clearer. The unavailability of the oil film pressure measurements for the engine, though, does not support as strongly the findings from imaging. The <b>top</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> operates under starved lubrication conditions. Oil droplets were captured by the camera emerging from the ring side clearances that contribute to oil transport. Higher magnification imaging gave further evidence and was compared with previous engine research on oil transport. The engine study was limited by the unclear images obtained from the CCD camera and the window size which on one hand has the required size for the fixture firing tests and on another is quite small to provide adequate information about the residence time of the cavities that were identified. Another limiting factor of the study regarding the simulation test rig is that it can only provide data for the case of atmospheric conditions. Imperial Users onll...|$|E

Current paper uses a finite element method to analyze the coating strength of a <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> at <b>compression</b> and power stroke transition, where peak combustion pressure is higher than other crank positions. The deformation, von Misses stress and strain in the core and coating interface are discussed elaborately...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The piston ring pack {{accounts}} for a disproportionate amount of the total engine frictional losses. The frictional behaviour of piston rings is significantly affected and governed by its flexible dynamics. The dynamically changing shape of the ring determines its contact geometry with the cylinder liner and hence affects the frictional losses. The <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> undergoes a multitude of complex motions during the engine cycle prescribed by the gas pressure, contact reaction, ring tension, friction between the ring and its groove and inertial forces that excite a plethora of the ring’s modal responses. This adversely compromises the functionality of the ring {{through a number of}} undesired phenomena such as ring flutter, twist, rotation and jump. Therefore, a prerequisite for improving the prediction of tribological conditions is an accurate determination of the ring’s elastodynamic response. This paper presents a methodology to directly solve the governing differential equations of motion for different forms of beam cross-section, where the shear and mass centres are not coincident, typical of the complex cross-sections of a variety of different piston <b>compression</b> <b>rings.</b> Combined numerical and experimental investigations are undertaken to determine the dynamic behaviour of the <b>compression</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{erection}} device helps draw {{blood into}} the penis by applying negative pressure. This type of device is {{sometimes referred to}} as penis pump and may be used just prior to sexual intercourse. Several types of FDA approved vacuum therapy devices are available with a doctor's prescription. When pharmacological methods fail, a purpose-designed external vacuum pump can be used to attain erection, with a separate <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> fitted to the penis to maintain it. These pumps should be distinguished from other penis pumps (supplied without <b>compression</b> <b>rings)</b> which, rather than being used for temporary treatment of impotence, are claimed to increase penis length if used frequently, or vibrate as an aid to masturbation. More drastically, inflatable or rigid penile implants may be fitted surgically.|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engine components {{have been a}} main research interest over many decades [1]. While bulk material and surface engineering developments have improved the resistance to fatigue, reduced the amount of wear and friction during operation, small improvements in race applications designs can increase the engine performance and give a competitive edge to racing engines. Piston rings are designed to create a seal {{which means that they}} will suffer large levels of material loss due to wear during operation. The <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> is the <b>top</b> or closest ring to combustion gases and is exposed to the highest operating temperature. In this paper, the authors propose a design modification to the <b>compression</b> <b>ring</b> coated chamfer which can reduce stress concentration and material loss during operation...|$|R
