5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within {{the first three months of}} the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace <b>their</b> <b>tickets</b> with Octopus cards in three months or have <b>their</b> <b>tickets</b> made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.|$|E
