5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on the practice field lights, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> they had no real {{interest in the subject}} itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|Following Dana's murder, {{the killer}} uses her {{cellphone}} {{to call the}} girls. Figuring out that something is wrong, they go outside to look for her. There, they discover Eve's decapitated head inside her car. Realizing there is a killer out there, Kelli calls 9-1-1, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> due to the snowstorm, help would be unavailable {{for at least two}} hours. When their housemother Mrs. Mac and Heather decide to take the car and reach the police station on their own, Kelli, Leigh and Melissa all go to Lauren's room to see them through their window and make sure they leave safely. Noticing that the car has started but they're not leaving, Kelli and Leigh go to check on them through the basement where Leigh slips on Mrs. Mac's blood, who had gotten killed by a falling icicle. Going back to Lauren's room, after a quick confrontation between Leigh and Kyle, they realize that Lauren has also been killed and despite protest from Kyle, decide to go to the attic in case any of the girls are still alive.|$|E
5|$|After Kaycee's 'death', mourners who {{requested}} {{an address to}} send condolence gifts, cards, or flowers <b>to</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that,</b> despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee, {{there was no longer}} a post-office box mailing address for her in Newton, Kansas. Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when she told him of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated.|$|R

The character Eduard Delacroix, a Cajun prisoner played by Michael Jeter, who <b>is</b> about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed <b>is</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Jingles, his pet mouse, {{will live in}} Mouseville.|$|R
5|$|On 18 April Keeler was {{attacked}} {{at the home}} of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy's account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused. The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan's private secretary, Timothy Bligh, to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. He added that he had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action. On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry. Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson's motives, after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward's general activities to ask the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, to inquire into possible security breaches.|$|E

25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that,</b> in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E

60|$|And now <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> of <b>that</b> famous battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Blamor de Ganys {{of which}} so much hath {{been written in}} all the several {{histories}} of chivalry that deal with these matters.|$|R
25|$|Lands of the north, {{formerly}} open {{to summer}} seasonal grazing, {{began to be}} taken and transformed into farms. Hence in late spring tribes of pastoral Berbers arrived at what they considered their customary grazing lands, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the land was now entirely owned by another, a planter, who refused them permission to graze and water their herds. The new, often large, agricultural operations produced grain for export, which quickly became highly profitable. The two opposing sides were firmly committed to their own interests.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{during the}} early 1960s, there were several scandals in California {{involving}} county assessors. These assessors were found rewarding friends and allies with artificially low assessments, with tax bills to match. These scandals led {{to the passage of}} AB 80 in 1966, which imposed standards to hold assessments to market value. The return to market value in the wake of AB 80 could easily represent a mid-double-digit percentage increase in assessment for many homeowners. As a result, a large number of California homeowners experienced an immediate and drastic rise in valuation, simultaneous with rising tax rates on that assessed value, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the taxed monies would be redistributed to distant communities. The ensuing anger started to form into a backlash against property taxes which coalesced around Howard Jarvis, a former newspaperman and appliance manufacturer, turned taxpayer activist in retirement.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Sunday 16 June Gaulle was at 10 Downing Street for talks about Jean Monnet’s mooted Anglo-French political union. He telephoned Reynaud – they were cut off during the conversation and had to resume later – {{with the news that}} the British had agreed. He took off from London on a British aircraft at 6.30pm on 16 June (it is unclear whether, as was later claimed, he and Churchill agreed that he would be returning soon), landing at Bordeaux at around 10pm <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> he was no longer a minister, as Reynaud had resigned as Prime Minister after the Franco-British Union had been rejected by his Cabinet. Pétain had become Prime Minister with a remit of seeking an armistice with Nazi Germany. De Gaulle was now in imminent danger of arrest.|$|E

25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three days, to get help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> he understands that his daughter is strong and can take care of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or too cold to support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that will be enough to keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E

500|$|Fourteen {{thousand}} {{pieces were}} returned to the Treasury, and were held in $1,000 sacks. This followed poor sales of the new coin in Paris—only 1,800 sold there; some 10,000 {{were returned to}} the United States. [...] They were held for many years. [...] In 1945, Omaha coin dealer Aubrey Beebe learned about the coins from government records and enquired, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the coins had been recently melted.|$|E
500|$|For {{three days}} in a row, the 2/6th Independent Company {{prepared}} to fly out from Port Moresby, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> its flight had been cancelled due to bad weather. On 17 September 1943, 13 Dakotas of the US 374th Troop Carrier Group finally took off for Leron. King flew in the lead plane, which was piloted by Captain Frank C. Church, whom Kenney described as [...] "one of Hutchison's 'hottest' troop carrier pilots". As it came in to land, King spotted patrols from the Papuan Infantry Battalion in the area.|$|E

500|$|McClellan further damaged his {{reputation}} by his insulting insubordination to his commander-in-chief. He privately referred to Lincoln, {{whom he had}} known before the war as {{a lawyer for the}} Illinois Central, as [...] "nothing more than a well-meaning baboon", a [...] "gorilla", and [...] "ever unworthy of ... his high position." [...] On November 13, he snubbed the president, who had come to visit McClellan's house, by making him wait for 30 minutes, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> the general had gone to bed and could not receive him.|$|E
500|$|Phil Harrison of Time Out {{said that}} [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] feels [...] "slightly anodyne despite its sweetly vicious climax."

Mike Joseph of PopMatters was much less impressed, giving the song a negative review: [...] "The dreary 'Kitty Kat' {{is a waste of}} four minutes of my time. Pharrell Williams, who produced this song, needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> his glory days are two years behind him if not more." [...] This was somehow echoed by Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic who wrote: [...] "Pharrell's other contribution to the album is the regrettably plain 'Kitty Kat,' a slower track that gives further credence to the view that he cannot cope when thrust outside his comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides {{borrowing}} {{the overall}} plot {{structure of the}} Cape Fear films, the episode made several direct references to specific scenes from the films. References to the original include: Marge going to Chief Wiggum only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> Sideshow Bob has not broken any laws (also references the 1991 remake). References to the 1991 remake include: Sideshow Bob's tattoos; the shot of him leaving the prison gate; the scene with him smoking in the movie theater; part of his [...] "workout" [...] scene; his hiding under the Simpson family's car; Wiggum's rigging wire around the house to a toy doll as an alarm; his suggestion that Homer can do anything to someone who enters his home; Bob, strapped under a car, pulling up beside Bart for a conversation; and Homer's hiring a private investigator who attempts to persuade Bob to leave town.|$|E
