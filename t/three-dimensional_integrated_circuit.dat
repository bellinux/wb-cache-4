40|$|Abstract—Thermal {{problems}} {{are important for}} <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> with high power densities. <b>Three-dimensional</b> stacked-wafer <b>integrated</b> <b>circuit</b> technology reduces interconnect lengths and improves performance compared to two-dimensional integration. However, it intensifies thermal problems. One remedy is to redistribute white space during floorplanning. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm to redistribute white space. In the first phase, the lateral heat flow white space redistribution problem is formulated as a minimum cycle ratio problem, in which the maximum power density is minimized. Since this phase only considers lateral heat flow, it also works for traditional two-dimensional <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits.</b> In the second phase, to consider inter-layer heat flow in <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits,</b> we discretize the chip into an array of tiles and use a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the maximum stacked tile power consumption. We compared our algorithms with a previously proposed technique based on mathematical program-ming. Our iterative minimum cycle ratio algorithm achieves 35 % more reduction in peak temperature. Our two-phase algorithm achieves 4. 21 × reduction in peak temperature for <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>circuits</b> compared to applying the first phase, alone. I...|$|R

Two boundary-element approaches are investigated, and it is shown that the straight-forward approach leads to unacceptable discretizat,ion errors, and a less intuitive second approach yields good results even with coarse surface meshes.
