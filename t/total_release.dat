Health risks include county level <b>total</b> <b>releases</b> from the Toxics Release Inventory, number of Superfund sites, and cancer mortality in the Southeastern U. S.

40|$|Waste Isolation Pilot Plant {{repository}} releases {{are evaluated}} {{through the application}} of modified parameters to simulate accelerated creep closure, include capillary pressure effects on relative permeability, and increase brine and gas saturation in the operations and experimental (OPS/EXP) areas. The modifications to the repository model result in increased pressures and decreased brine saturations in waste areas and increased pressures and brine saturations in the OPS/EXP areas. Brine flows up the borehole during a hypothetical drilling intrusion are nearly identical and brine flows up the shaft are decreased. The modified parameters essentially halt the flow of gas from the southern waste areas to the northern nonwaste areas, except as transported through the marker beds and anhydrite layers. The combination of slightly increased waste region pressures and very slightly decreased brine saturations result in a modest increase in spallings and no significant effect on direct brine <b>releases,</b> with <b>total</b> <b>releases</b> from the Culebra and cutting and caving releases unaffected. Overall, the effects on <b>total</b> high-probability mean <b>releases</b> from the repository are insignificant, with <b>total</b> low-probability mean <b>releases</b> minimally increased.
