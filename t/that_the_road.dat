5|$|Completion was {{postponed}} to July 4, before being again postponed to late summer 1940 when rain delayed paving operations. Paving would conclude {{by the end}} of the summer, and on September 30 the turnpike commission announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> would open on October 1, 1940. Since the turnpike was opened on short notice, no ribbon-cutting ceremony was held.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and slippery conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is the most often closed in the province.|$|E
5|$|In North White Plains, {{the area}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> passes through becomes {{a little less}} {{developed}} as it goes over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the traffic circle where the BRP ends and the Taconic State Parkway begins, just south of Kensico Dam.|$|E

5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{be turned over to}} the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its first two years of existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|Due to toll {{reductions}} in 2012 that were 25 to 40 {{percent less than}} when the road was privately owned, the number of vehicles using the toll portion of the expressway increased by 19 percent that year, {{as compared to the}} previous year. It was estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> would be fully paid off in 2042, and there were reports of decreased traffic on Chula Vista streets and an increase in retail business.|$|E

5|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, the {{consensus}} remained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was most probably Roman. It was still referenced as an undoubted Roman road in a 1947 UK Government report and in 1957 Margary, the leading authority on Roman roads at the time, accepted the road as Roman and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in his list of Roman roads in Britain. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this was a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument. Several works in the 1980s and 1990s stated that Roman-era road construction was still the most probable explanation of the structure.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years Bryan used his {{influence}} to rename, in memory of his homeland, both the town and the river, much to the disgust of Lyttleton. It was reported in 1831 newspapers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from Launceston to Carrick had been opened. The path of the road was announced in April 1831, and it was opened for public traffic in June. The State Government sold town allotments in late 1838, obtaining what was noted as a high price of £45 (A$8,100 in 2005) per acre.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} opening in December 2015, a Sefton Council {{committee}} meeting recorded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was being very well used, with noticeably less {{traffic on the}} roads it was bypassing, those being the Northern Perimeter Road and Lydiate Lane respectively. It was subsequently reported in January 2016 that {{a section of the}} road would need to undergo a series of repair works during the evenings of a three-week period, just five months after the road opened to traffic. A year after opening, road users were giving generally positive feedback, with some confirming that travel times had been reduced and offers a more convenient means of accessing the motorways, although a common recurring concern were the junction issues at Switch Island.|$|E
50|$|In {{the budget}} of 1909, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> system would be self-financing, and so from 1910 <b>the</b> proceeds of <b>road</b> vehicle excise duties were dedicated to fund the building and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> system.|$|R

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{on the western}} terminus of <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Historically, <b>the</b> Darling Causeway continued as the Bells Line of Road, terminating at with some claims and supporting <b>road</b> signage indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road's</b> western terminus is at [...] near Lithgow.|$|R
5|$|The {{distance}} from Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo (formerly Nojpetén) to Mérida, {{combined with the}} difficult terrain and the hostility of the natives led to the road from Yucatán falling {{into a state of}} disrepair. In 1701 Ursúa y Arezmendi realised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was in such a poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucatán. He wrote to the King of Spain, requesting that Petén be transferred from the jurisdiction of Yucatán to the Audiencia Real of Guatemala. In 1703 Ursúa's petition was granted, with the condition that the ecclesiastical authority over Petén would pass to the Dominican Order.|$|E
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, the {{trunkline}} {{passes through}} mixed agricultural and wood lands {{into the community}} of Lawton. M-40 follows Main Street through town and exits on a northwestern track towards the village of Paw Paw. M-40 crosses over I-94 and turns north into town running along Maple Lake. The highway crosses the narrow isthmus between the larger Maple Lake and the smaller Ackley Lake, passing through some small residential subdivisions as it leaves Paw Paw. Small farms dot the landscape as M-40 crosses M-43 {{in a rural area}} of the county on the way to Gobles. It is in this small city <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> crosses the Kal-Haven Trail State Park, a linear park that follows the former Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad line. The rail line was converted into a rail trail and allows users to bike, hike or snowmobile between Kalamazoo and South Haven.|$|E

50|$|Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., concurred {{with the}} majority. <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> Pinetop used were BIA or tribal <b>roads</b> would mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state was taxing for revenue {{that would not}} be needed to {{maintain}} <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> being used, and that this amounted to double taxation.|$|R

5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> would have a negative impact for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Jones {{surveyed}} Ancaster, Thorold, Grantham, Beverley, Southwold, Whitby, York, Scarboro, Pickering, {{the lands}} of Joseph Brant and Lake Simcoe. On December 24, 1795 Jones was directed by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe to survey and open a cart road from the newly planned settlement of York, Upper Canada to Lake Simcoe. Jones began the planning work the next day. On the 29th of that December, Jones was given the assistance of thirty of the Queen's Rangers for the road's construction. The work began January 4, 1796 on this road, which would become Yonge Street. Jones worked as the effective master builder {{in addition to his}} title as surveyor. The road reached Holland Landing on February 16, 1796, and Jones returned to York on February 20 to inform the Lieutenant Governor <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was completed. This first incarnation of Yonge Street measured some 34 miles and 53 chains. For the rest of 1796, Jones spent his time surveying Newark, Flamborough, Grimsby, Saltfleet, Beverley, York and Coot's Paradise.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|In August and October1955, NY344 and the Taconic State Park {{south of}} the road was {{inundated}} with floods damaging the blacktop surface highway. The reconstruction of NY344 was the center point of debate came in late February1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if the road was rebuilt. Local officials {{in the town of}} Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956USD) to reconstruct the road. In April1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was barricaded in Copake Falls for {{the fact that there was}} no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY344 was nearly complete by March1957.|$|E
