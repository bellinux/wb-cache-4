500|$|In 1964, Gardner {{began his}} novelist career with The Liquidator, {{in which he}} created the {{character}} Boysie Oakes who inadvertently is mistaken to be a tough, pitiless man of action and is thereupon recruited into a British spy agency. In fact, Oakes was a devout coward who was terrified of violence, suffered from airsickness and was afraid of heights and Gardner admitted of him that, [...] "though I have denied it many times—he was of course a complete piss-take of J.

Upon reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher wrote, [...] "Mr. Gardner succeeds in having it both ways: He has written a clever parody which is also a genuinely satisfactory thriller." [...] The book was made into a film of the same name by MGM and another seven light-hearted novels and two short stories about the cowardly Oakes appeared over the next eleven years.|$|E
500|$|The novel Miracle at St. Anna {{was written}} by James McBride [...] {{originating}} from his late uncle's experiences as a World War II soldier. [...] Upon writing the novel, McBride conducted his own research and learned of the 92nd Infantry Division, which consisted of 15,000 African-American soldiers, who served in Italy during World War II from August 1944 to November 1945. McBride interviewed several remaining members of the 92nd Division. [...] "I studied Italian at The New School in New York City," [...] he explained. [...] "I moved to Italy with my family for six months. I interviewed dozens of Italians—Partisans and Fascists. I interviewed dozens of African-American soldiers who fought in the war, most who have since passed away. I must have read at least 20 books. I went to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I studied <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>business</b> of what the 92nd did in Italy during the war, {{to try to get}} an idea of what really transpired."

500|$|In Groucho and Me, Groucho Marx called Skelton [...] "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and [...] "the logical {{successor}} to [...] Chaplin", {{largely because of}} his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. [...] "With one prop, a soft battered hat", Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, [...] "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." [...] He added that Skelton also [...] "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors." [...] In late 1965 ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. [...] "It's all so very different today. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>business</b> of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton."

I could take <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>business</b> away from them." [...] In 1925, {{he set out}} to do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including Filene's department store owner Louis Kirstein and Union Stockyards and Armour and Company owner Frederick H. Prince. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money. In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation. By March, he was traveling to Hollywood. The president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays, was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and Wall Street's faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as [...] "exceedingly American" [...] (historian Cari Beauchamp explains the connotation: [...] "not Jewish," [...] in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's [...] "background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood." ...|$|E

For a client whose patron was another's client, the potential for shame was still worse. Even as a satirical analogy, the equation of togate client and slave would have shocked those who cherished the toga {{as a symbol of}} personal dignity and auctoritas – a meaning underlined during the Saturnalia festival, when the toga was [...] "very consciously put aside", in a ritualised, strictly limited inversion of the master-slave relationship.|$|E

Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: [...] "Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb.

2500|$|To an extent, Mahagonny is {{an opera}} that satirizes operas. Brecht said that [...] "t attacks {{the society that}} needs operas of such a sort" [...] and Weill said that it [...] "pays {{conscious}} tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and Mahagonny in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the deus ex machina tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free {{to do what they}} want, and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the [...] "love" [...] is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The [...] "Mandalay Song" [...] also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>business.</b> In Mahagonny, operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.|$|E
