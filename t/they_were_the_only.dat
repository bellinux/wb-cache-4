5|$|Following the Fire, the {{thoroughfares}} of Queen Street and King Street were newly laid out, {{cutting across}} more ancient thoroughfares in the City, {{creating a new}} route up from the Thames to the Guildhall; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> notable new streets following the fire's destruction {{of much of the}} City.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was one of}} four U.S Air Force Medal of Honor {{recipients}} of the Korean War.

His Medal of Honor citation reads as follows.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{interest}} in the road came in mid-1969, when the National Park Service approved a plan to develop the facilities with Amistad. The Rough Canyon and Diablo East portions of the park were given particular focus, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> two that were in existence at the time. Large boat ramps were constructed at both areas, {{in an attempt to}} increase tourism.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. The number who died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Australia, {{along with}} New Zealand, were widely {{recognized}} as the strongest teams in the Oceanian zone. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> teams to have won the OFC Nations Cup, and {{the only ones to}} have qualified for the World Cup: Australia had qualified in 1974 and New Zealand in 1982. American Samoa were one of the weakest teams in the world, having lost all of their official international matches since they had joined FIFA in 1998. Prior to the match, Australia was ranked 75th in the FIFA World Rankings, while American Samoa was ranked 203rd, the lowest of all FIFA members.|$|E
5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum, {{commonly}} known as Rabbs' fringe-limbed treefrog, is an extinct species of frog in the family Hylidae. They were relatively large frogs that inhabited the forest canopies of central Panama. Like {{other members of the}} genus Ecnomiohyla, they were capable of gliding by spreading their enormous and fully webbed hands and feet during descent. The males of the species were highly territorial and would guard water-filled tree holes used for breeding. They were also the ones responsible for guarding and caring for the young, including providing food. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> known species of frog where the tadpoles derived nutrition by feeding on the skin cells of their fathers.|$|E

5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> ethnic group encountered by the European party that {{had built a}} bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the family}} moved to a {{neighborhood}} on Figueroa Street where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Chinese on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E

5|$|Many {{products}} were specially manufactured {{to commemorate the}} event. Saris, fish knives, betel-leaf boxes and other memorabilia with Elokeshi's name printed or inscribed on them were made. A balm for headache was advertised as using the oil made by the mahant in the jail oil press. Such commemorative items were still in sale in as late as 1894. These items were unique {{in the sense that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> such commemorative items modelled on an event.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, 2007, Neon Bible {{was named}} to the {{shortlist}} for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Patrick Watson was announced as the winner at a gala ceremony on September 24, 2007. However, due to the band's preference not to participate in compilation albums, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> nominee not to have a track on the Polaris promotional compilation 2007 Polaris Music Prize. Some media initially reported that the Polaris committee had snubbed the band by excluding them, leading the band and the committee to issue a joint press release confirming that the band chose not to have a track included on the album.|$|E
5|$|On Midway, by 4 June the USN had {{stationed}} four squadrons of PBYs—31 {{aircraft in}} total—for long-range reconnaissance duties, and 6 brand-new Grumman TBF Avengers, the latter a detachment from Hornets VT-8. The Marine Corps stationed 19 Douglas SBD Dauntless, 7 F4F-3 Wildcats, 17 Vought SB2U Vindicators, and 21 Brewster F2A Buffalos. The USAAF contributed {{a squadron of}} 17 B-17 Flying Fortresses and 4 Martin B-26 Marauders equipped with torpedoes: in total 126 aircraft. Although the F2As and SB2Us were already obsolete, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> aircraft available to the Marine Corps at the time.|$|E
50|$|Elegant Action Figures: quite {{different}} from the Tassel and Sash figures, these figures are almost always shown running, kneeling or hunting with multi-barbed spears and boomerangs. These are difficult to place in the style sequence as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> figures that <b>are</b> not superimposed over a painting from another period. Also, no other style is superimposed over them and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> style that has not <b>been</b> defaced. Stylistically, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> believed to fall between the sash and Clothes Peg Figures.|$|R

5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets fore and aft. Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> guns heavy enough {{to penetrate the}} thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
5|$|Sebille was {{the first}} person in the U.S. Air Force to be awarded the Medal of Honor since the branch's {{beginning}} in 1947, and the 31st MOH recipient of the Korea War. The Four U.S. Air Force members including Sebrille who received the medal in that war were pilots who were killed in action. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> USAF members to receive the Army version of the medal (the Air Force version was first awarded during the Vietnam War).|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens have {{developed}} strong rivalries with two fellow Original Six franchises, {{with whom they}} frequently shared divisions and competed in post-season play. The oldest is with the Toronto Maple Leafs, who first faced the Canadiens as the Toronto Arenas in 1917. The teams met 15 times in the playoffs, including five Stanley Cup finals. Featuring the two largest cities in Canada {{and two of the}} largest fanbases in the league, the rivalry is sometimes dramatized as being emblematic of Canada's English and French linguistic divide. From 1938 to 1970, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> two Canadian teams in the league.|$|E

5|$|The cavalry practised {{reconnaissance}} {{and fighting}} dismounted more regularly, and in January 1910, {{the decision was}} made at the General Staff Conference that dismounted cavalry should be taught infantry tactics in attack and defence. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> cavalry from a major European power trained for both the mounted cavalry charge and dismounted action, and equipped with the same rifles as the infantry, rather than short-range carbines. The cavalry were also issued with entrenching tools prior to the outbreak of war, as a result of experience gained during the Second Boer War.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{suffered a}} big setback in the 1987 legislative election. The UCR lost {{the majority in}} the chamber of deputies. All provinces elected Peronist governors, with the exception of Córdoba and Río Negro. Along with the city of Buenos Aires (a federal district at the time), <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> districts where the UCR prevailed. As a result, the government could not move forward with its legislative agenda, and the PJ only supported minor projects. The PJ was strengthened for the 1989 presidential elections, and the UCR sought to propose governor Eduardo Angeloz as candidate. Angeloz was a rival of Alfonsín within the party.|$|E
5|$|After the {{cessation}} of hostilities, the battalion remained in the Aitape–Wewak area undertaking occupation duties. Its strength was slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for demobilisation or transferred to other units for further service. Eventually, the remaining cadre of personnel returned to Australia, and on 8 February 1946 the 2/3rd Battalion disbanded in Brisbane, {{as one of the}} most decorated battalions of the 2nd AIF. They had fought all the major Axis powers: the Italians, Germans, Vichy French and Japanese. Alongside the Australian 2/5th Battalion, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Allied troops able to make this claim. During its service a total of 3,303 men served with the 2/3rd Battalion of whom 203 were killed and 432 wounded. Members of the 2/3rd received four Distinguished Service Orders, 16 Military Crosses, 12 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 30 Military Medals, two British Empire Medals and 73 Mentions in Despatches.|$|E
