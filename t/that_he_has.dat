5|$|Aang {{proposes a}} beach party {{in lieu of}} training, {{explaining}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> decided to challenge Fire Lord Ozai only after Sozin's Comet and its enhancement of firebending have come and gone, due to his self-perceived inability to fight the Fire Lord on equal footing. When Zuko tells the group that Ozai {{plans to use the}} comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom and Water Tribes, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a simulation fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his pacifistic nature and non-violent upbringing, and even berates his friends after they tell pointedly him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no choice but to kill Ozai.|$|E

5000|$|Appearing on the Jorge Rial {{radio program}} later in April, Molinari {{maintained}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no involvement in money-laundering; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never met Báez; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met Fariña in late 2010, when Fariña had approached {{him with the}} idea of starting a luxury-car rental agency; and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known Federico Elaskar since the latter was 15 years old and a friend of his son, living in the same apartment building as the Molinaris, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never done business with him. “I'm a businessman,” Molinari said. “I do business.” ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Olivia {{has decided}} not to tell Peter about his origins. Walter says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> made the {{opposite}} decision, and that the truth must be known.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the prime}} universe, Peter and Fauxlivia are in bed {{together}} when Peter receives {{a call from the}} cleaning lady, who relays the message: that Olivia is trapped in the parallel universe.

5000|$|Sergeant Cullinane first claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> raided Whelans once at 6pm, {{but after}} other people gave {{statements}} saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> visited twice, <b>he</b> admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> raided it again at 6:35pm. <b>He</b> said <b>that</b> the only the Whelans were present both times.|$|R
2500|$|Police said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been in {{psychiatric}} care, {{where he}} was treated for depression. Prosecutors said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been treated for two months in a mental care facility in 2015. De Maizière said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may <b>have</b> been bullied by his peers, and police said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> suffered [...] "bodily injury" [...] in an incident involving other young people in 2012. During the attack, Sonboly shouted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been bullied for seven years.

5|$|During these episodes, Stephen feels {{lonely and}} writes to Isabelle, {{feeling that there}} is no one else to whom he can express his feelings. He writes about his fears that he will die, and confesses <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> only ever loved her.|$|E
5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically asserts <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{read the}} letters (he only says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined {{to take him}} at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius {{did not get the}} tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Dr.Dre {{started working}} with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette, In {{the past few years}} Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr.Dre's productions.

Although an attempt was made to identify the maul and ascertain whether any of Williams's shirts had bloodstains on them, the courts could not assess forensic evidence and gave great weight to eyewitnesses' statements.|$|R
50|$|MSK {{initially}} {{fabricated evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> consensual {{sex with a}} 14-year-old, Tegan Wagner, before admitting in late 2005 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lied.|$|R

5|$|In Jötunheimr, the jötunn Þrymr {{sits on a}} barrow, {{plaiting}} golden collars for {{his female}} dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses.

Loki responds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> bad news for both the elves and the Æsir—that Thor's hammer, Mjöllnir, is gone. Þrymr says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved, but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr {{and back to the}} court of the gods.|$|E

Doherty insisted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "always been upfront" [...] about the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not completed his degree, clarified his educational credentials, and acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> qualified as a civil engineering technician and not a civil engineer.|$|R
5|$|Later, Pete {{talks about}} his despair at the day's events with Don in the elevator, {{wondering}} how the fight occurred, when {{he thought they were}} all friends. Close to tears, he blurts out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> nothing. Don doesn't respond.|$|E

5|$|Peter states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{learned his}} lesson {{and will never}} do it again. Instead {{he is going to}} try for such things as a {{minority}} scholarship, a sexual harassment suit, and a disability claim.|$|E
5|$|Sheppard's efforts {{contributed to}} the {{contemporary}} debate on European colonialism and imperialism in the region, particularly amongst the African American community.

50|$|Although Boesak {{applied for}} a presidential pardon from Thabo Mbeki after his release, it was not granted, as the {{government}} felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> committed an offence. However, on 15 January 2005, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received a presidential pardon and that his criminal record would be expunged.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, {{there was}} some {{controversy}} around McGarvie's party membership prior to his 1933 preselection by the United Australia Party, when it was alleged by the Country Party <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{been a member of}} their party up until that time. McGarvie acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been receiving the party's newspaper and stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been approached to stand for the Country Party at the previous election, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> declined the approach and denied the allegation <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been a party member.

It was also proved <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been drunk in the House of Commons, a fact to which one of the clerks of the House, very much against his will, was called upon to testify. <b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> destroyed himself there was no doubt,--nor was there any doubt as to the cause.|$|R
