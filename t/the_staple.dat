40|$|Laparotomy for {{penetrating}} {{wounds to}} the abdomen is demanding {{in terms of}} time, skill and resources. Any modification of existing techniques that will lessen these demands will be of benefit at surgery in forward areas in war. A previous paper (1) compared a method of small bowel anastomosis using disposable skin staplers with a two-layer handsewn anastomosis using fresh pig ileum. <b>The</b> <b>stapled</b> method was both significantly faster to perform and mechanically superior. In two further studies on a total of 12 pigs <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method has been compared with a single-layer and a double-layer handsewn small bowel anastomosis. All 12 pigs recovered from laparotomy without complication. Construction times were recorded. The quality of healing of the anastomoses was assessed by clinical observation, post-mortem and histological examination, and tensiometry. The skill required to perform <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomoses was estimated subjectively. <b>The</b> <b>stapled</b> technique was consistently faster than the handsewn methods. A Kolmogorov two-sample test showed an improvement in times when comparing <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method with <b>the</b> single layer, with a significance of P = 0. 05. An improvement was also seen when <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method was compared with the double layer, with a significance of P = 0. 01. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the construction times for the two handsewn methods. There was no evidence of anastomotic failure or haematoma at post-mortem and no adverse reaction to <b>the</b> metal <b>staples.</b> No features were identified on histology to indicate impaired healing with <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> method. Tensiometry of the anastomoses showed that <b>the</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomosis is as mechanically reliable as the handsewn anastomosis. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{discovers that}} the {{surgical}} staple gun was tampered with. The guns come in packs of three but the pack was broken up between three surgeries, one {{was given to}} Ted, another to George White (Dan Amboyer) who Megan has to perform emergency surgery on after finding him near-dead, and the third staple gun was not used. Megan finds traces of fungus found on bonsai trees on <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> guns and Megan realizes that Gwen has bonsai trees. When her son died, he was pledging for the fraternity where George is president. Gwen tampered with <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> guns to kill George, not realizing that the pack would be broken up. Ethan and Curtis find out that Jessica had a genetic mutation that caused a blood clot, so Ethan warns Karen that she might also have one. Megan confronts Gwen, who confesses to Megan. Gwen is eventually taken away by the police, after admitting to George's attempted, and Ted's accidental murder.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the Bering Sea. The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. <b>The</b> <b>staple</b> diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> crop in {{the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
5|$|In Maine, on {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, {{shifting}} fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed for the lack of availability of the herring which is <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. Others have been provisioning the nest with butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) but these are often too large and deep-bodied for the chick to swallow, causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird's breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.|$|E

5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E
5|$|Millet is <b>the</b> <b>staple</b> food {{throughout}} Chad. It {{is used to}} make {{balls of}} paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as alysh; in the south, as biya. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as salanga (sun-dried and lightly smoked Alestes and Hydrocynus) or as banda (smoked large fish). Carcaje is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink millet beer, known as billi-billi when brewed from red millet, and as coshate when from white millet.|$|E
5|$|Much of Morondava on {{the west}} coast was flooded, after a dam near the city collapsed. Maintirano along the west coast was also damaged, as was Soavinandriana in the island's interior. In the capital city Antananarivo, 90km/h (56mph) wind gusts caused power outages and damaged part of the Rova, or the Queen's Palace. In Midongy Atismo in southeastern Madagascar, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded 80% of rice crop, and the corn and manioc crops were both similarly affected.
