5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|If <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E

There are many temples around Thanjavur {{district}} of Tamil Nadu that are larger than these 3 temples even; one such is Thillai Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram spread out in 40 acres and <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> temple complex.

5|$|In 2006, the ALBC began {{investigating}} the Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> descendent of Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type of Colonial Spanish stock. In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses were tested in the effort.|$|E

In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

There was questioning of whether in practice the hijab was <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> female choice or if women were being coerced or pressured into wearing it. Many instances, such as a period of forced veiling for women in Iran, brought these issues to the forefront and generated great debate from both scholars and everyday people.|$|E

Marketed as a 32-coin set with one set released on an annual basis, the decade would close with another 50-cent series. A coin set to honour Canadian sports first was released.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} (some say fundamental) signature rhythm {{figure of}} merengue is the quintillo, {{which is essentially}} a syncopated motif whose pattern is broken by five successive drumhead hits at the transition between every second and third beat, alternating between the hand and the stick. To purists, a merengue without quintillo is not <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> merengue, a viewpoint that has gradually disappeared as other alternate figures are used more frequently (as the one traditionally called jaleo, also known as merengue bomba, wrongly identified as a mixture of merengue and Puerto Rican bomba music, and which actually also {{has its roots in}} traditional merengue).|$|E
25|$|Beside the Clearwater River at {{the base}} of White Horse Bluff, there is a natural refrigerator. The McDiarmid family {{operated}} four fishing camps along the river from 1944 to 1970.

They enlarged it, built some walls and were able to keep ice solid and perishable foods cold even in the summer heat, <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> luxury in the wilderness. The refrigerator is still there today (although partly fallen in) and, when measured by this writer in June 2003, was 2 degrees Celsius inside.|$|E

A SOBHD World Highland Dance Championship has been held annually at the Cowal Highland Gathering since 1934. Today this SOBHD World Championship is sanctioned by the SOBHD at three levels: Juvenile, Junior and Adult. However due to SOBHD rules, only SOBHD registered dancers may compete at this SOBHD championship, so is not <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> 'world' championship.|$|E
