5|$|Hindu scriptures, {{dated to}} between 5th century and 1st century BC, while {{discussing}} human diet, initially suggest kosher meat may be eaten, evolving {{it with the}} suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes Your Love Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E

25|$|The term ergative–absolutive is {{considered}} unsatisfactory by some, {{since there are}} very few languages without any patterns that exhibit nominative–accusative alignment. Instead they posit <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> only speak of ergative–absolutive systems, which languages employ to different degrees.|$|E
25|$|Arguments from {{testimony}} rely on {{the testimony}} or experience of witnesses, possibly embodying the propositions of a specific revealed religion.

25|$|While private {{property}} rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> trust and hope in God rather than in one’s material possessions, {{and there is an}} acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money.|$|E
25|$|In a {{political}} battle, he said <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> {{wait for an}} attack from his opponent, then counterpunch as strong and as fast as possible. Early gaffes in Clinton's political career were a result, he believed, of taking too long to respond to attacks.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the central}} teachings of Confucianism is <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> remonstrate with authority. Many Confucians {{throughout}} history disputed their superiors in order to not only prevent the superiors and the rulers from wrongdoing, but also to maintain the independent spirits of the Confucians.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem is}} a paradox of the veridical type, because the correct choice (<b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> switch doors) is so {{counterintuitive}} it can seem absurd, but is nevertheless demonstrably true. The Monty Hall problem is mathematically {{closely related to the}} earlier Three Prisoners problem and to the much older Bertrand's box paradox.|$|E
25|$|Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani {{has stated}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> face the {{direction}} of the Earth.

25|$|The author {{says it is}} puzzling {{that we live in}} what he {{considers}} a male-dominated society, and yet very little work has been done to understand the archetypal basis of masculinity. He suggests that {{this may be due to}} a societal assumption of male superiority, founded on the belief <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> not question that which is deemed to be right and superior.|$|E
25|$|The Mishneh Torah was {{strongly}} opposed {{almost as soon}} as it appeared. Major sources of contention were the absence of sources and the belief that the work appeared to be intended to supersede study of the Talmud. Some criticisms appear to have been less rational in nature. Indeed, Maimonides quotes the Talmud in stating <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> study the Talmud for a third of one's study time.|$|E

25|$|There {{are five}} vices (habitual desires) {{outlined}} in the Guru Granth Sahib <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> try to control. One of these vices is lust, and some Sikhs believe that homosexual thoughts and behaviour are just manifestations of lust. However, Sikhs that are more accepting of homosexuality claim that this is equally applicable to heterosexuals. These same Sikhs believe that Guru Nanak's emphasis on universal equality and brotherhood is fundamentally {{in support of the}} human rights of homosexuals.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the Torah defines no minimum or maximum for the {{donation}} {{of the corners}} of one’s field to the poor. But the Mishnah also taught <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>should</b> not make the amount left to the poor less than one-sixtieth of the entire crop.
