5|$|After {{working for}} his father for two years with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, Ryan {{returned}} to college coaching as the defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bearcats. The Bearcats won the first Humanitarian Bowl over Utah State in Ryan's final year, marking the team's first bowl appearance in fifty years. Ryan was the Oklahoma Sooners' defensive coordinator for {{a year in which}} <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked sixth in the nation. However, head coach John Blake failed to achieve a winning record for a third straight year and subsequently, the entire staff was fired. Ryan served as defensive coordinator at Kansas State for a month in 1999 under head coach Bill Snyder.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{and other}} nearby cities faced the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. In {{the absence of}} {{reinforcements}} from Spain, viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the resistance against the second invasion. Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda, Jaime Lavallol and José Olaguer Reynals. Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> successful, and the British were driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally.

On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked No. 37.

5|$|On June 1, 1942, the US Supreme Court denied two of Waller's {{petitions}} for appeal, and <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> soon {{left without}} further legal options.

The Ravens lost by a score of 23-14 in the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias to explain what had gone wrong with his expedition.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> that the CPUSA sought {{to convert the}} US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E

5|$|At {{that time}} the reorganized Lithuanians {{returned}} to the battle, attacking von Jungingen from the rear. The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and advancing Lithuanian cavalry. As von Jungingen attempted {{to break through the}} Lithuanian lines, he was killed. According to Cronica conflictus, Dobiesław of Oleśnica thrust a lance through the Grand Master's neck, while Długosz presented Mszczuj of Skrzynno as the killer. Surrounded and leaderless, the Teutonic Knights began to retreat. Part of the routed units retreated towards their camp. This move backfired when the camp followers turned against their masters and joined the manhunt. The knights attempted to build a wagon fort: The camp was surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification. However, <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> soon broken and the camp was ravaged. According to Cronica conflictus, more Knights died there than on the battlefield.

5|$|Chicago's defense {{allowed the}} 5th least total yardage, allowed less than 100yards per {{game on the}} ground, and allowed the fewest yards per drive of any NFL team.

Behind them, {{two of the three}} Bears starting linebackers, Lance Briggs, and Brian Urlacher, were selected to the 2007 Pro Bowl. In the secondary, cornerbacks Ricky Manning and Charles Tillman each recorded five interceptions. <b>The</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> also able {{to make up for the}} offense's poor performance earlier in the season, as explained in the win against the Cardinals in Week 6.|$|E

The top individual performer on <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> linebacker Cody Grimm, who tied for the most forced fumbles in college football during the regular season, with seven. In recognition of the achievement, he earned the Dudley Award, given annually to the top Division I football player in Virginia, and was named a first-team All-ACC and third-team All-America player. Cornerback Stephen Virgil, a starter for the Hokies in 10 of their regular-season games, was declared ineligible for the Chick-fil-A Bowl because of poor grades. Defensive coordinator Bud Foster was wooed by several other teams between {{the conclusion of the}} regular season and the Chick-fil-A Bowl, but Foster remained at Tech after the school created an annuity for Foster, granted if he remained with the team for five more years.|$|E

The defense consistently performed well in the following years. As a result, Ryan was promoted to defensive coordinator in 2005 following the departure of Mike Nolan, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.
