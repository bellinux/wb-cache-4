25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. <b>They</b> <b>explained</b> <b>how</b> the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), when Moses grew up, {{he went to}} his brethren and saw their burdens. He saw an Egyptian {{striking}} a Hebrew, he looked this way and that, and when he saw no one, he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. When he went out the next day, he came upon two Hebrew men fighting, and he asked the wrongdoer why he struck his fellow. The man asked Moses who had made him king, asking him whether he intended to kill him as he did the Egyptian, so Moses realized that his deed was known. When Pharaoh heard, he sought to kill Moses, but Moses fled to Midian, where he sat down by a well. The priest of Midian's seven daughters had come to water their father's flock, but shepherds drove them away. Moses stood up and helped the daughters, and watered their flock. When they came home to their father Reuel, he asked how they were able to come home so early, and <b>they</b> <b>explained</b> <b>how</b> an Egyptian had delivered them from the shepherds, and had also drawn water for the flock. Reuel then asked his daughters why they had left the man there, and told them to call him back to join them for a meal. Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to marry. Moses and Zipporah had a baby boy, whom Moses called Gershom, saying that he had been a stranger in a strange land. The third open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "the Imaginary" [...] {{originates}} {{in the writings}} of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (see the Imaginary) and is strongly associated with Castoriadis' work. To understand it better we might think of its usual context, the imaginary institution of societies. By that, Castoriadis means that societies, together with their laws and legalizations, are founded upon a basic conception of the world and man's place in it. Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries, expressed through various creation myths, by which <b>they</b> <b>explained</b> <b>how</b> the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason (as examined above). That same imaginary is, interestingly enough, the foundation of its opposing ideology, Communism. By that measure he observes (first in his main criticism of Marxism, titled the Imaginary Institution of Society, and subsequently in a speech he gave at the Université catholique de Louvain on February 27, 1980) that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought, since they share the same industrial revolution type imaginary: that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not, as he claimed, the main drive of social change, since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first.|$|E

DOI: 10. 1093 /mind/LXXXIII. 331. 429 [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]One of the main difficulties in Chomsky's account of generative grammars and linguistic theories is to determine what exactly these grammars and theories explain. In some places Chomsky seems to be saying that <b>they</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> a set of sentences might be generated and in others that <b>they</b> <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> these sentences are actually generated. On the whole his earlier writings accord with this first view and it is not until his more recent writings that a subtle change of emphasis inclines him to the second view. Only this first view is justified and when this is realised a lot of the contemporary discussion on questions of innateness will be rendered groundless. [opening paragraph...|$|R
