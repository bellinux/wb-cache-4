40|$|AbstractIn {{pavement}} engineering a crude uniform {{contact pressure}} over a circular contact area {{is used to}} generate key strains for an analytical design method. The use of a more advanced tyre contact pressure measurement device {{has led to a}} situation where there is more information that is available to generate a more accurate uniform representation of contact pressure. This measurement device also offers the ability to measure non-uniform 3 -D tyre contact pressure. That is to say the vertical, transverse and longitudinal components of pressure generated by a tyre in contact with a pavement. A comparison of the key strains generated by this improved uniform contact pressure representation and the measured 3 -D contact pressure is of great interest. Of course a tyre does not display the same contact pressure for different combinations of axle loading and inflation pressure. The combination of these two factors greatly affects the nature of the contact pressure observed. A finite element mesh of a 3 -layer thin pavement structure was created in CAPA- 3 D. This was used to model the uniform and 3 -D contact pressure representations of a wide based tyre. This was done for 3 inflation pressures and 3 <b>tyre</b> <b>loads.</b> The inflation pressures were for a recommended inflation pressure and then plus and minus 200 kPa. The <b>tyre</b> <b>loading</b> was for a maximum European axle loading and then greater and lower than this value. This gave a good spread of conditions that are relevant to the tyre operating conditions. The key strains at different locations in the pavement relevant to the major distresses of a pavement were assessed. The main distress mechanisms being top down cracking, asphalt cracking/rutting, traditional bottom up cracking and subgrade rutting. These gave a good spread of possible distresses that tyre contact pressure can contribute to. The results showed that there was a large effect on surface strains caused by 3 -D contact pressure in comparison to uniform contact pressure for all combinations of inflation pressure and <b>tyre</b> <b>loading.</b> The difference between the two contact pressure representations diminished with depth in the pavement. Therefore, it was clear that 3 -D contact pressure has an effect on the distress of a pavement surface. This means to accurately understand the deterioration of a pavement surface, 3 -D contact pressure must be considered. In the case of the other distresses the uniform contact pressure generated greater strains and would give a conservative pavement design. Both methods generated greatly different key strains depending on the combination of inflation pressure and <b>tyre</b> <b>loading.</b> If a complex highly accurate analysis is required, then a fully 3 -D representation in combination with finite element analysis is the best option. However, if a more routine analysis is required then the improved uniform contact pressure representation could be used with a simple modelling tool (e. g. BISAR) to get good results for a traditional analytical design...|$|R

40|$|Loading soil via {{pneumatic}} tyres {{is a major}} cause of compaction of agricultural soils, which causes damage to the soil-water-air-plant system. The loads applied to the soil and the resulting pressure influences the degree of soil compaction. This study was conducted to determine an effective method to measure the pressure distribution under a selection of pneumatic agricultural tyres. This was conducted initially on a non-deformable surface; a later study will consider pressures within the subsoil. From this the tyre carcass stiffness was determined and methods to predict carcass stiffness were evaluated. Tyre carcass stiffness is defined as an equivalent pressure resulting from the stiffness of the tyre carcass. In order to estimate the carcass stiffness of tyres a number of approaches were considered including: (i) footprint area, (ii) <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> – deflection, (iii) pressure mapping and (iv) tyre manufacturer's specification methods. Carcass stiffness values obtained from the footprint area method gave results significantly lower (30 – 40 %) than those obtained using the pressure mapping system. The method based on the <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> – deflection characteristics was found to give a better estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness of the smooth rather than the treaded tyre. The technique of using the tyre manufacturer's specification data, where the estimation of the tyre carcass stiffness was calculated using the theoretical load that the tyre could support at zero inflation pressure, produced estimates that were within ± 20 % of the mean carcass stiffness determined using the pressure mapping system...|$|E

Two ways have been followed to reach this objective a fully experimental approach, aiming at the direct determination of the hub forces, and a mathematical one, based on multi-body (MB) modelling. An intensive experimental activity has been carried out to set-up a dynamometric hub for the evaluation of direct hub forces and to collect information relevant to the vehicle’s dynamic response under typical handling manoeuvres, such as steering-pad and double lane change. The data acquired in these tests have been used to calibrate and validate a truck MB model...|$|E

Inboard front brakes (as well as independent suspension) reduced unsprung weight.

As of now process reached to saturation level, additional investment may not prove to be competitive in the market because as investment increases, cost of the product also increases.

This resulted in rapid localised failure of the supporting soil that in turn led to excessive transverse flexure of the roadway and ultimately plastic deformations. It is shown that the performance of rollable roadway systems under tyred vehicle trafficking will be improved by eliminating joint rotation to increase longitudinal stiffnes...|$|R

Also, by adding a term in the objective function related to the dynamic <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> variation, we can simultaneously optimize the handling behaviour of the vehicle.

40|$|Vehicle {{suspension}} optimisation is {{a complex}} and difficult task, as {{there are a variety}} of factors influencing the dynamic performance of a vehicle.

The motivation for this research was therefore to provide objective and user-friendly methodologies for vehicle suspension optimisation, in order to support student projects like Formula Student, while having relevance to the needs of the South African automotive industry and racing community. With the onset of digital data acquisition, it has become feasible to take real-time measurements of tyre temperatures, to provide information on how a tyre is performing at a specific point on the track.

The results suggest that both the objective and subjective methods could yield enhanced driver ride and dynamic <b>tyre</b> <b>loads</b> over the most probable ranges of operating conditions when compared with the baseline dampers.

Linear analysis procedures are followed in studying the passive, active and slow-active suspension systems while suitable simulations are used for the non-linear semi-active suspension systems. Linear optimal control theory is used to determine the optimal parameters of the active and slow-active suspension systems.

40|$|Excessive {{behaviour}} {{of vehicles}} {{is often the}} subject of study, motivated by either the development of active safety systems uch as ESP, or the improvement of vehicle performance such as for racecars. In all of these cases, combined slip {{needs to be taken}} into account. In many cases however, the full set of tyre characteristics is not available. Consequently, one needs to work with inaccurate combined slip properties based on estimated slip stifnesses and friction levels. It would be a great advantage if combined slip characteristics could be estimated accurately, especially for truck tyres and racecar tyres, where facilities are rare and testing is very expensive. For passenger cars and light van tyres, about 60 % of the testing effort is spent in combined slip. This means time and costs which could be saved by this accurate estimation. Moreover, apart from this reduction of the testing effort, the estimation could be a tool for assessment in testing tyres in combined slip leading to better quality tests results. Anyhow, it will permit to derive combined slip characteristics when no test-data are available. First, some fundamental aspects in tyre modelling are given with the MF-Tyre Model (Magic Formula) treated in detail. Combined slip as described by the MF-Tyre model is discussed with the characteristics derived and compared with different passenger car tyres. In parallel, combined slip is also studied from a more fundamental scope using the physical Brush Model, with special focus on the ratio between tyre forces under pure slip and combined slip conditions (the weighting functions). Various methods to derive these weighting functions based on pure slip characteristics without testing are treated. Among these, two methods lead to satisfactory results, the Slip Circle Sinusoidal Method (SCS) presented by Pottinger and especially the Practical Slip Similarity Method (PSS), derived and developed by the authors. Among others, these methods will be compared with the Magic Formula fits and the experimental results with observed deviations for the PSS-method in shear force with measurement results bounded by 5 % for large <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> and less than 8 % for low <b>tyre</b> <b>load.</b> A comparision of the SCS-method and PSS-method with the MF-fits for large slip suggests improvements of the Magic Formula tyre model, Between the various estimations for the prediction of the combined slip based on pure slip characteristics, the Slip Circle Method and the Practical Slip Similarity Method, derived and developed by the authors will lead to a satisfactory prediction with respect to measurement data.

40|$|To work {{towards an}} {{advanced}} {{model of the}} bicycle-rider-environment system, an open-loop bicycle-rider model {{was developed in the}} commercial multibody dynamics software ADAMS. The main contribution of this article to bicycle dynamics is the analysis of tyre and rider properties that influence bicycle stability. A system identification method is used to extract linear stability properties from time domain analysis. The weave and capsize eigenmodes of the bicycle-rider system are analysed. The effect of tyre properties is studied using the tyre’s forces and torques that have been measured in several operating conditions. The main result is that extending simplified models with a realistic tyre model leads to a notable decrease in the weave stability and a stabilization of the capsize mode. This effect is mainly caused by the twisting torque. Different tyres and tyre inflation pressures have little effect on the bicycle’s stability, in the case of riding straight at a constant forward speed. On the other hand, the <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> does have a large effect on bicycle stability. The sensitivity study of rider properties shows that body stiffness and damping have a small effect on the weave and capsize mode, whereas arm stiffness destabilizes the capsize mode and arm damping destabilizes the weave mode...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the impact of increased loading on roads, studies on tyre-road interaction have gained prominence in recent years. Tyres form an essential interface between vehicles and road pavement surfaces. These are the only parts of the vehicle that are in contact with the road and transmit the vehicle loading to the road surface. The use of the Cartesian coordinate system is convenient in dealing with a uniform/non-uniform <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> acting over a rectangular area, but few research reports are available that provide any form of theoretical solutions for pavement responses. This paper presents analytical solutions of responses due to rectangular loading acting on the surface of a multi-layered pavement system. The solutions developed incorporate both isotropic and cross-anisotropic material properties. The method followed is based on classical trigonometric integral and Fourier transformation of Navier’s equations. Accuracy and validity of the solutions are verified through comparisons with a proprietary finite element method (FEM) package. For this purpose, a pavement structure composed of five main layers constituted by isotropic and cross-anisotropic (also known as transversely isotropic) material properties is analysed. In order to vary some of the layer properties with depth, the main layers were sub-layered, resulting in a 17 -layer pavement system.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{eigenfrequencies}} of a deformed tyre exhibit a mutual repulsion behaviour if the rotation velocity is increased. This phenomenon is known as frequency loci veering and is induced by the a-periodicity resulting from the tyre deformation due to {{the weight of the}} car. The corresponding eigenmodes interact in the transition zones and finally interchange. This is not the case for the undeformed tyre, where {{it is well known that}} rotation splits the eigenfrequencies around the eigenfrequencies of the non-rotating tyre. The change in eigenfrequencies is linearly related to the rotation velocity and is determined by the circumferential wavenumber and tyre radius only. For the undeformed tyre no modal interaction occurs as a consequence of rotation. Furthermore, modal interaction increases as <b>tyre</b> <b>load</b> increases and decreases as material damping increases. In previous work a methodology to model tyre vibrations has been developed, exploiting a modal base determined in a standard FE package and including rotational effects by a coordinate transformation. Major advantages of this approach are that the complex build-up of a tyre is retained and that the large (nonlinear) deformations and small (linear) vibrations are treated separately. In the present paper, the effects of deformation on the eigenfrequencies of a rotation tyre are examined using this methodology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{accurate}} {{determination of}} a vehicle's lateral behaviour {{is necessary in}} the domain of vehicle dynamics to improve vehicle safety. Its interaction with the road surface must be understood thoroughly, which requires the integration of a force model, representing the tyre-ground interface, into the global vehicle model. The validity of such a model directly depends on its nature and more particularly on the accurate determination of its inputs and outputs. This paper focuses on one input: the wheel camber angle. Studies in collaboration with a car maker have shown that a measurement error below 0. 1 ◦ is necessary to identify the tyre model parameters from real data accurately. At the same time, measurement performance must be insensitive to the test conditions, and more particularly to the road surface (tyre-road grip). For these reasons, a novel vision-based method for direct camber determination has been developed and a measurement prototype has been designed. Its vision-based principle is mainly aimed at giving accurate measurement. Its precision is robust to the road's unevenness and the vehicle's velocity; the <b>tyre</b> <b>loaded</b> radius is determined at the same time. The novel method's feasibility and the measurement performance of the designed prototype have been studied from real vehicle-on-track measurements with a test car...|$|R

This study aims to explore pitch dynamics and suspension tunings of a two-axle heavy vehicle with unconnected suspension, which could also provide valuable information for heavy vehicles with coupled suspensions. Based on a generalised pitch-plane model of a two-axle heavy vehicle integrating either unconnected or coupled suspension, three dimensionless measures of suspension properties are defined and analysednamely the pitch margin (PM), pitch stiffness ratio (PSR), and coupled pitch stiffness ratio (CPSR) for different unconnected suspension tunings and load conditions. Dynamic responses of the vehicle with three different load conditions and five different tunings of the unconnected suspension are obtained under excitations arising from three different random road roughness conditions and a wide range of driving speeds, and braking manoeuvres. The responses are evaluated in terms of performance measures related to vertical and pitch ride, dynamic <b>tyre</b> <b>load,</b> suspension travel, and pitch-attitude control characteristics of the vehicle.

40|$|The present thesis work {{is part of}} the {{feasibility}} study of a lightweight fuel-cell urban vehicle named Hyrban. The vehicle mounts four wheel hub electric motors instead of a traditional single motor on the chassis. This causes a sensible increase of the unsprung-to-sprung mass ratio of the car. The aim of the thesis then, has been to investigate the effects of this imbalance, in particular pointing out the attention on the comfort behaviour. Through a frequency analysis of simple models it has been possible to define and evaluate the variation of the comfort index to the mass ratio increase and for various damping coefficients. It yielded not only that the comfort index gets worse as the mass ratio increases, but also that it is less sensitive to its change when the damping coefficient is lower than the optimal value. The last one is variable relatively to the mass ratio, while the total mass and the bounce frequency are assumed to be constant.

40|$|A new {{formulation}} {{to determine}} the unit impulse response (Green’s) functions of a <b>loaded</b> rotating <b>tyre</b> in the vehicle-fixed (Eulerian) reference frame for tyre/road noise predictions is presented. The proposed formulation makes use of the set of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes for the statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> obtained from a finite element (FE) model of the tyre. A closed-form expression for the Green’s functions of a rotating tyre in the Eulerian reference system {{as a function of}} the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the statically <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> is found. Non-linear effects during loading are accounted for in the FE model, while the frequency shift due to the rotational velocity is included in the calculation of the Green’s functions. In the literature on tyre/road noise these functions are generally used {{to determine the}} tyre response during tyre/road contact calculations. The presented formulation opens the possibility to solve the contact problem directly in the Eulerian reference frame and to include local tyre softening due to non-linear effects while keeping the computational advantage of describing the tyre dynamics as a set of impulse response functions. The advantage of obtaining the Green’s functions in the Eulerian reference system is that only the Green’s functions corresponding to the potential contact zone need to be determined, which significantly reduces the computational cost of solving the tyre/road contact and since the mesh is fixed in space, a finer mesh can be used for the potential contact zone, improving the accuracy of the contact force calculations. Although these effects might be less pronounced if a more accurate tyre model is used, it is found that using the Green’s functions of the <b>loaded</b> <b>tyre</b> in a contact force calculation leads to smaller forces than in the unloaded case, lower frequencies are present in the response and they decrease faster as the rotational velocity increases...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates an {{approach}} for predicting rut formation in asphalt concrete (AC) layers. The approach {{is based on}} a linear viscoelastic model for predicting permanent vertical strain in AC layers subjected to a moving load. The input data are <b>tyre</b> pressure, <b>loading</b> speed, lateral wandering of loading wheel, shear modulus and phase angle of AC layer. The analytical approach takes into consideration the change in material characteristics in respect of temperature and changes in the air void content of AC layers due to repeated loading. The approach is verified by a full-scale accelerated loading test at different temperatures. The approach has shown good agreement as regards the prediction of flow rutting in AC layers. In addition, the approach is capable of calculating rutting profiles including the upheaval, which is important for estimating rut depth...|$|R
