40|$|This gamma {{irradiation}} {{study was}} conducted <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> LD 50 of the hop (Humulus lupulus L.) cultivar Cascade. The overall, long term goal is to generate replacement hop cultivars by inducing minor but significant DNA alterations with gamma radiation to improve agronomic quality without changing the brewing profile. The objective of this experiment is to evaluate various gamma radiation doses <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> LD 50 in Cascade hop. Nodal explant segments of micropropagated hops were placed on petri plates of NCGR Humulus medium. The explants were irradiated with 6 doses of gamma radiation(5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 Gy). Survival rates (25 %) of Cascade hop when irradiated with 5 Gray (Gy) was too low <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> LD 50. Therefore, a lower range of radiation doses is needed <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> LD 50 of Cascade hop...|$|R

In 2013, Bahrain topped the Arab world for internet penetration (90% of the population), trailed by the United Arab Emirates (86%) and Qatar (85%).
