40|$|Teaching and Learning Department Capstone ProjectThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at Kindergarten {{students}} and understand how they move from <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> themselves <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience. Kindergarten students are still young children and have difficulty taking on the perspectives of others. For this reason, it is hard <b>for</b> them <b>to</b> <b>write</b> so that someone other than themselves can read their writing. However, during the Kindergarten year students experience a shift in perspectives that makes <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience possible. Students move from <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> themselves <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience. This paper examines the journey that Kindergarteners go through as they move from <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> themselves <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience.

5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>for</b> existing ensembles.

5|$|Some science-fiction {{fans have}} speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002).
