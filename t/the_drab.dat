25|$|In some cases, it was {{the bright}} colours and {{flamboyant}} nature of the uniform that attracted men to the army. The chance to wear something as distinctive as the regimental red could be extremely tempting; a new and vivid uniform {{would have been a}} welcome change from <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> colours worn by most men in everyday society and soldiers frequently drew interest from admiring women.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} by the females {{by day and}} by the males by night. This uses the colouration of the two sexes to escape detection of the nest, as <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> female blends in with the sand, while the black male is nearly undetectable in the night. The incubation period is 35 to 45days, which is rather short compared to other ratites. This {{is believed to be}} the case due to the high rate of predation. Typically, the male defends the hatchlings and teaches them to feed, although males and females cooperate in rearing chicks. Fewer than 10% of nests survive the 9 week period of laying and incubation, and of the surviving chicks, only 15% of those survive to 1 year of age. However, among those common ostriches who survive to adulthood, the species is one of the longest-living bird species. Common ostriches in captivity have lived to 62 years and 7 months.|$|E

An article for The Daily Telegraph in 2005 described Doctor Who as the [...] "spiritual successor" [...] to the Quatermass serials, and Mark Gatiss, a scriptwriter for Doctor Who, wrote of his admiration of Kneale in an article for The Guardian in 2006. [...] "Kneale wrote that [...] was 'an over-confident year' and he piloted his hugely influential tale like a rocket into <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> schedules of Austerity Britain… What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{desiring}} {{to avoid}} stereotypes of the costume drama, Webber costumed his actors in simple outfits he termed [...] "period Prada," [...] rather than use the ruffles and baggy costumes common for the era.

[...] Costume designer Dien van Straalen explored London and Holland markets in search for period fabrics, including curtains and slipcovers. For Griet, van Straalen employed [...] "... pale colors for Scarlett Johansson to give her <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> look of a poor servant girl." [...] Firth was also outfitted simply, as Vermeer was not rich. Van Straalen created more elaborate costumes for Wilkinson, as van Ruijven was to her [...] "... a peacock strutting around with his money." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Corliss {{noted that}} the film {{appeared}} to have been influenced by The Wizard of Oz and the works of Maurice Sendak, writing, [...] "Labyrinth lures a modern Dorothy Gale out of <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> Kansas of real life into a land where the wild things are." [...] Nina Darnton wrote that the plot of Labyrinth [...] "is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida's baby sister is stolen by the goblins". Copies of Outside Over There and Where the Wild Things Are are shown briefly in Sarah's room {{at the start of the}} film, along with copies of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, a book by Hans Christian Andersen, Grimms' Fairy Tales and Walt Disney's Snow White.

500|$|The first {{introduction}} of drab general uniform {{was by the}} British Corps of Guides in India in 1848. Initially <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> uniform was specially imported from England, {{with one of the}} reasons being to [...] "make them invisible in a land of dust". However, when a larger quantity was required the army improvised, using a local dye to produce uniform locally. This type of drab uniform soon became known as khaki (Urdu for dusty, soil-coloured) by the Indian soldiers, and was of a similar colour to a local dress of cotton coloured with the mazari palm. The example was followed by other British units during the mutiny of 1857, dying their white drill uniforms to inconspicuous tones with mud, tea, coffee or coloured inks. The resulting hue varied from dark or slate grey through light brown to off-white, or sometimes even lavender. This improvised measure gradually became widespread among the troops stationed in India and North-West Frontier, and sometimes among the troops campaigning on the African continent.|$|E
500|$|... "Day 'n' Nite" [...] is the album's turning point, {{where it}} {{transitions}} from <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> theme of loneliness to vitality. Among the brighter songs are [...] "Enter Galactic (LoveConnection Part 1)", a [...] "trippy disco anthem" [...] that {{is inspired by}} when he and a female friend ate shrooms and listened to music by The Postal Service together. [...] "Make Her Say" [...] includes a sample of pop singers Lady Gaga's 2009 smash hit [...] "Poker Face" [...] and features verses from West and Common. It takes Gaga's naughty, mischievous central hook and turns it around to be an unrefined oral sex reference {{that makes it a}} [...] "hyper-catchy, forward-looking single." [...] He channels André 3000 in [...] "Cudi Zone". Man on the Moon: The End of Days closer is [...] "Up Up and Away", an escapist drug anthem single. Unlike other music's common theme of drugs being used as an escape from the unpleasant realities, this however, is about breaking free from the rough reality of someone's own mind and heart.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} to immediate critical acclaim. Some reviewers praised the book as an exciting way to learn to read, particularly compared to the primers that it supplanted. Ellen Lewis Buell, in her review for The New York Times Book Review, noted the book's heavy use of one-syllable words and lively illustrations. She wrote, [...] "Beginning readers and parents who have been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise." [...] Helen Adams Masten of the Saturday Review called the book Geisel's tour de force and wrote, [...] "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their {{children are going to}} have the exciting experience of learning that they can read after all." [...] Polly Goodwin of the Chicago Sunday Tribune predicted that The Cat in the Hat would cause seven- and eight-year-olds to [...] "look with distinct distaste on <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> adventures of standard primer characters".|$|E

2500|$|The old fort's {{administrative}} annex, which {{survived the}} construction of Taylor's Customs House, was enlisted as the Presidential offices by Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s and his successor, Domingo Sarmiento, who beautified <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> building with patios, gardens and wrought-iron grillwork, had the exterior painted pink reportedly in order to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the country's two opposing political parties: red {{was the color of}} the Federales, while white was the color of the Unitarians. [...] An alternative explanation suggests that the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage from the effects of humidity.

2500|$|Romanticism {{was an art}} and {{literature}} movement formed by people looking to escape <b>the</b> <b>drab</b> world. [...] Its characteristics are paintings of [...] "exotic lands" [...] with grandiose feeling and intense color. Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli developed a highly individual Romantic style of painting with richly colored, dappled, and textured painting and glazed surfaces. Monticelli was a French painter of the generation preceding the Impressionists who was friends with Narcisse Diaz, {{a member of the}} Barbizon school, and the two often painted together in the Fontainebleau Forest. Vincent van Gogh, greatly admired his work after seeing it in Paris when he arrived there in 1886. Van Gogh was influenced by the richness that he perceived in Monticelli's work.

However, Desson Howe's review in The Washington Post criticized Foley's direction, writing that it [...] "doesn't add {{much more than the}} street between. If his intention is {{to create a sense of}} claustrophobia, he also creates the (presumably) unwanted effect of a soundstage. There is no evidence of life outside the immediate world of the movie".

[...] Critics were not fond of the sherbet colors of the painted slats of the monument because they found the excessive amount of sweetness almost sickening; however, from farther away, they acknowledged the power and splendor it emanated in its commonplace surroundings.|$|E
