40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the industry and}} organizational factors that determine the likelihood of business response to government tax incentives for privately financed termination benefit programs and the substitution problems confronting government programs that use tax incentives to encourage businesses to provide these benefits to their employees. It concludes that government tax incentives will likely have marginal effects on the private provision of <b>termination</b> <b>benefits,</b> especially in large firms in industries with a strong market presence from government. These programs most likely will get high participation from large firms which already provide these benefits to salaried and hourly workers resulting in high substitution effects. They also are likely to extend benefits to hourly employees in firms that already provide similar benefits to salaried workers. However, these tax incentives {{are likely to have}} very limited inducement effects on small and medium-sized firms resulting in low overall target efficiency for these programs.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide Australian {{evidence}} on both the extent and key determinants of discretionary disclosure in company annual reports of information about top executives&# 039; share rights, options and termination entitlement. Such information has value-relevance to shareholders and the public, but prior evidence is lacking about the factors that influence top managements&# 039; decisions to voluntarily disclose or withhold personally sensitive details about their own remuneration. Design/methodology/approach: The extent and nature of executive remuneration disclosure are obtained from the content analysis of annual reports of 191 Australian listed companies for the years 2003 and 2004, prior to a more detailed prescriptive regulatory environment occurring in this area when international financial reporting standards became effective in 2005. To explain the factors that could influence managements&# 039; decisions about the extent of discretionary disclosure details concerning their own remuneration, the perspectives of legitimacy theory and corporate governance structures are invoked. Relationships are hypothesized and tested between the extent of remuneration disclosure and the following variables: shareholder activism, media attention, company size, board composition and existence of a remuneration committee. Findings: Regression results reveal significant relationships between these determinants and the extent of disclosures of rights, options and <b>termination</b> <b>benefits</b> of executives. These results suggested that, under a relatively unregulated environment, corporate management will react to community and shareholders&# 039; expectations by revealing personally sensitive information when their company is placed in a situation of higher shareholder and public scrutiny and when it is structured to meet expectations of good corporate governance...|$|E

40|$|Eviction of {{plantation}} workers, due to {{the development}} of estate lands and changing land ownerships, has been a big and unresolved issue. Many plantation areas have been sold to make way either for housing projects or industrial sites. When an estate is sold, the estate workers lose not only their jobs, but also their homes and additional sources of income from farming and animal husbandry. They are also entitled to receive <b>termination</b> <b>benefits.</b> The majority of these displaced workers have skills only in the agricultural sector {{and many of them are}} old aged. The main objective of this study was to analysis the socioeconomic situations of the displaced workers {{due to the}} development of the rubber estate lands in Kedah. The snowball sampling method was used to identify the respondents. The survey was based on 11 estates and 349 ex-workers of these estates were interviewed. The areas of this study were in Sungai Petani and Kulim. The results clearly showed that the majority of the evicted workers migrated to locations that were on average around 3 km from their original estates. The majority of them worked with private sector companies upon their evictions. However, many of them are still in their estate houses, waiting for better compensation to be paid in the form of new houses elsewhere. It is suggested in this paper that the compensation should be in terms of home ownership, provided jointly by the government and firms.

40|$|A {{catalyst}} for this inquiry was concern that executive pay had {{got out of}} hand. This perception was fuelled by practices in financial institutions abroad that were seen as a key contributor to the global financial crisis. Further, while local shareholder value plummeted in 2008 {{as a result of}} that imported crisis — with some companies and sectors being propped up by taxpayers — executive pay seemed to emerge unscathed, crystallising a view that executives were being rewarded for failure (after having been rewarded for success). This has come on top of longstanding community discomfort about the widening gap between the remuneration of executives and other employees, as well as some large termination payments with perceived lack of justification. Public opinion polling over the years consistently shows that most respondents believe executives to be overpaid. But polls also reveal limited awareness of the drivers of executive pay and wealth creation. Accordingly, this inquiry was tasked with ascertaining what has actually happened to executive pay in Australia’s publicly-listed companies, as well as identifying what can and should be done about it. The appropriate test for any policy intervention is that it promotes community wellbeing: hence the Commission has explored the likely drivers of executive pay and the economic implications of current pay levels and structures. Ultimately, judgment must be exercised, particularly in relation to the magnitude of identified problems and the case for intervention, taking into account both the potential costs and benefits. The Commission's final recommendations constitute an integrated package of reforms that would strengthen board decision-making on executive remuneration, by reducing board 'clubbiness', removing potential for conflicts of interest and enhancing accountability for pay outcomes. Shareholders would get better information and would have more 'say on pay'. executive remuneration, <b>termination</b> <b>benefits,</b> remuneration packages, equity-based payments...|$|E

Keywords: job insecurity, emotion focused coping, {{outsourcing}} employees In {{the banking}} world today many companies use outsourcing employees, which companies using outsourcing employees {{can concentrate on}} the activities and objectives of the company's core, other than {{that the company is}} also not burdened with the problems of <b>termination</b> <b>benefits</b> if the company does not want to sign another labor. In contrast to outsourcing employees this very unfortunate because it creates uncertainty about the clarity of continued employment during the contract period lasts and fear of outsourcing labor if the contract was not renewed for enterprises. It can bring the job insecurity (insecurity in the works) on the employee. Based on these problems researchers wanted to know whether there is a relationship between job insecurity with emotion focused coping on outsourcing employees. This research is a quantitative correlation with purposive sampling technique that is non-random sampling. Subjects were examined in this study as many as 75 employees, outsourcing the back office and front office.

40|$|The United States Accounting Standards Codification is {{the source}} of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, that all publically traded U. S. {{companies}} and many private companies adhere to. This thesis concerns the United States Accounting Codification and how it is applied to real-life scenarios derived from various business activities. These different scenarios were provided by Dr. Victoria Dickinson in a series of twelve different case studies and covered numerous areas of financial reporting. This thesis is the compilation of the solutions to those case studies and has been verified to be in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Numerous benefits were realized upon completion of every case study. These include enhanced knowledge of financial reporting topics, technical skills, theoretical concepts, exceptional research processing ability, and a critical thinking approach to constructing solutions to contextualized problems. A different financial reporting topic was chosen each week, with the difficulty increasing as more knowledge was gained regarding the Codification and GAAP. These topics include financial statement preparation and consultation, systems evaluation and fraud prevention, inventory recognition, asset capitalization, accounting for <b>termination</b> <b>benefits</b> and relocation costs, market shares and treasury stock, stock options and stock-based compensation, revenue recognition, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and accounting for lease transactions. Mastering these topics mandated also the mastery of technical skills such as the infinite uses of Microsoft Excel and Word. Without these, financial statement preparation or analysis would be near impossible. Perhaps the most beneficial skill and ability acquired during these case studies was the ability to take a critical thinking approach to a real-life case where an obvious answer was not immediately transparent. This included contextualizing the problem in the case, knowing the accounting area that applied to the problem, and having the ability to research the U. S. Accounting Codification to find which accounting principle applied depending on the scenario. The knowledge and skills gained from these case studies will be invaluable in my future career as a public accountant. While I still have much to learn, the experience acquired in this course left me with not only tangible skills, but also the confidence of knowing that this course has prepared me well for challenges or problems I may face in my professional career. Interning at a large firm immediately following graduation, I know that this course will give me a distinct advantage over my colleagues that have not taken the course and completed these case studies...|$|E
