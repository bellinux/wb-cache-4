California Musical Theatre and its Summer stock theatre, Music Circus, lure many directors, performers, and artists from New York and Los Angeles to work alongside a large local staff for their productions at the Wells Fargo Pavilion.

These objections have been rejected by most scientists, as have claims that intelligent design, or any other creationist explanation, meets the basic scientific standards that would be required to make them scientific alternatives to evolution.

The player discovers that Planet is a dormant semi-sentient hive organism <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>soon</b> experience a metamorphosis which will destroy all human life. To counter this threat, the player or a computer faction builds [...] "The Voice of Alpha Centauri" [...] secret project, which artificially links Planet's distributed nervous system {{into the human}} Datalinks, delaying Planet's metamorphosis into full self-awareness but incidentally increasing its ultimate intelligence substantially by giving it access to all of humanity's accumulated knowledge. Finally, the player or a computer faction embraces the [...] "Ascent to Transcendence" [...] in which humans too join their brains with the hive organism in its metamorphosis to godhood. Thus, Alpha Centauri closes [...] "with a swell of hope and wonder {{in place of the}} expected triumphalism", reassuring [...] "that the events of the game weren’t the entirety of mankind’s future, but just another step." ...|$|E

2500|$|The new rave scene can {{be viewed}} as a media construct, largely propounded by the NME and TRAX, with other {{publications}} treating the subject as a joke. The belief that many of the bands associated with new rave can more appropriately be associated with the genre of dance-punk has given credence to such suggestions, although differences between both genres are said to be minor and more down to aesthetics.

2500|$|The overall {{metropolitan}} LA {{economy was}} healthy {{and in just}} one five year boom period (1985 to 1990) attracted 400,000 working immigrants (mostly from Asia and Mexico) and about 575,000 workers from elsewhere in the U.S. [...] The jobs they were offered depended largely on their educational qualifications. Half of the immigrants from abroad owed their employment to the immigrant economy with Asian entrepreneurs employing Latino workers. [...] Large-scale economic changes have brought major social changes with them. While unemployment dropped in Los Angeles in the 1990s, the newly created jobs tended to be low-wage jobs filled by recent immigrants; the number of poor families increased from 36% to 43% {{of the population of}} Los Angeles County during this time.
