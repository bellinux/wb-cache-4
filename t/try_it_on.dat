25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the use of lithium therapy for the mentally ill. After the war he worked as Deputy Medical Superintendent at Graylingwell Hospital, a large {{psychiatric}} hospital in Chichester in Sussex. In the early 1950s an Australian colleague showed him an article by John Cade in The Medical Journal of Australia on the beneficial effects of lithium on patients with mania. He decided to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> some of his more severely affected patients, and found it worked in many cases. He wrote up the results in a 1956 edition of the Journal of Mental Science, after which his work was followed up in Britain by his colleague Ronald Maggs and others.|$|E
25|$|These hunts are {{a source}} of {{conflict}} between pro- and anti-whaling countries and organizations. The U.N.'s International Court of Justice, in addition to other Nations, scientists, and environmental organizations consider the Japanese research program to be unnecessary and lacking scientific merit, and describe it as a thinly disguised commercial whaling operation. Japan maintains that annual whaling is sustainable and necessary for scientific study and management of whale stocks, though the Antarctic minke whale populations have declined {{since the beginning of the}} JARPA program and those whales killed have shown increasing signs of stress. Japan, echoing Norway's arguments on its own whaling activities, also argues it is entitled to continue whaling because because of whaling's place in its cultural heritage. The whale meat from these hunts is sold in shops and restaurants, and is showcased at an annual food festival that, in some cases, features the butchering of a whale for onlooking children. A poll in 2014 found that few Japanese people today eat whale meat regularly, and tourists are often reluctant to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> ethical grounds.|$|E
25|$|During {{his college}} summers and vacations, Riley {{had worked in}} the mines of the nearby Silver Valley at Wallace, and landed a job there with a mining company {{following}} graduation at age 26 in 1952. The school superintendent was short-handed for instructors and asked him to fill in as a teacher, and he agreed to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> an interim basis, with the mining company's permission. After growing up in a tough environment, Riley admired the hard-nosed grit of the mining community and found he liked teaching and coaching, and never returned to mining. He started as an assistant coach in football and basketball and the head coach in baseball. He was the head football coach at WHS for four seasons, starting in 1955, leading the Miners to a 23-14-1 record. He was also the head coach in basketball for two seasons, starting in the fall of 1957. Riley met his wife, Mary Shumaker from nearby Mullan, while working in Wallace; they were married in November 1951 and their first two sons were born there. They left Wallace in 1959 for Lewiston, where he was the head football coach at Lewiston High School for three years. His overall record with the LHS Bengals was 15-14-1, with a final season of 1-8 due to disciplinary actions.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks after}} Arneson's Blackmoor demonstration, Gygax had {{produced}} a 50-page set of rules, {{and was ready}} to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his two oldest children, Ernie and Elise, in a setting he called [...] "Greyhawk". This group rapidly expanded to include Don Kaye, Rob Kuntz and eventually a large circle of players. Gygax sent the 50 pages of rules to his wargaming contacts and asked them to playtest the new game. Gygax and Arneson continued to trade notes about their respective campaigns, calling the amalgamation of Blackmoor and Greyhawk [...] "The Great Kingdom". This collaboration gradually petered out as Gygax and Arneson realized their visions for the new game were diverging.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot in bright, primary colors rather than the {{black-and-white}} of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual languid pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as [...] "intuitive". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of Reverse Shot as [...] "giving {{the impression of a}} failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis’s glamor and <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> for size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch.|$|E

2500|$|Davis's trumpet and McLaughlin's guitar {{parts were}} heavily overdubbed for the recording. The overdubbing effect {{was created by}} {{superimposing}} part of Davis's trumpet solo onto other parts of it, through something Teo Macero calls a [...] "recording loop". Macero later said of this production technique, [...] "You hear the two parts and it's only two parts, but the two parts become four and they become eight parts. This was done over in the editing room and it just adds something to the music [...] I called [...] in and I said, 'Come in, I think we've got something you'll like. We'll <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> and {{if you like it}} you've got it.' He came in and flipped out. He said {{it was one of the}} greatest things he ever heard". DeJohnette's drums were also manipulated by Macero, who used an automatic switcher to have them rattle back and forth between the left and right speakers on the recording. In his book Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Davis-biographer Phil Freeman describes this technique as [...] "100 percent Macero" [...] and writes of its significance to the track as a whole, stating: ...|$|E
2500|$|Goddard and {{his team}} had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he {{received}} a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August his engine was producing 800lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature {{at the last minute}} there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, [...] "Putting [...] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow." ...|$|E

[...] The fraud accusations and the large loss of cattle combine to take a toll on Seccombe's health and he commits suicide leaving Charlotte a widow. Mervin Wendell (Anthony Zerbe), his wife Maude (Lois Nettleton), and young son Philip (Doug McKeon) come to town. The Wendells are ostensibly itinerant actors but in reality they are charlatans and con-artists working their way across the new railroad towns {{one step ahead of the}} law. Their favorite con is called the [...] "badger game". The con works on the local pastor and the Wendells reap large blackmail proceeds. Their plan turns sour when they <b>try</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a worldwise businessman, Soren Sorenson (Sandy McPeak). He recognizes their trick, too late, and threatens to expose them. Wendell attacks him. [...] They struggle and Sorenson is killed by Maude Wendell. While looking through his belongings, they find a large fortune in cash that Sorenson was going to use to finance a real estate purchase. Philip hides the body in a subterranean cave along the riverbank. [...] They keep the money but realize that they cannot spend it as it will expose their guilt.|$|E

There {{is a set of}} old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins[...] [...] [...] The children or young patients play together {{all the rest of the}} day and are in perfect health till the eighth.
