The Castle fires fiercely on them, makes furious sallies, steals six of our oxen,--makes insolent gestures from the walls; at least one soldier does, this day. 'Sir, may I give that fellow a shot?' asks the Prussian sentry. 'Do, then,' answers his Major: 'too insolent that one!' And the sentry explodes on him; brings him plunging down, head foremost (HERUNTER PURZELTE); the too insolent mortal, silent enough thenceforth."

The spirit of that decent usage has continued {{from the time of the}} Romans <b>till</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b> No man was ever brought before your Lordships that did not carry the outward as well as inward demeanor of modesty, of fear, of apprehension, of a sense of his situation, of a sense of our accusation, and a sense of your Lordships' dignity.|$|E

40|$|Alchemy was {{a science}} practiced {{for more than}} two millennia up till the end of 18 th century when it was {{replaced}} by modern chemistry, which is practiced up <b>till</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b> The purpose of this report is to look into this shift and investigate whether this shift can be classified as a paradigm shift according to the famous philosopher Thomas Kuhn, who came up with a theory on the structure of scientific revolutions. In order to come to draw any kind of conclusions, the report summarizes and defines the criteria for what constitutes a paradigm, crisis and paradigm shift, which are all important in order to investigate the manner in which a paradigm shift occurs. The criteria are applied to the historical development of modern chemistry and alchemy as well as the transition between the two sciences. As a result, alchemy and modern chemistry satisfy the requirements and can be viewed as two different paradigms in a Kuhnian sense. However, it is debatable whether the shift from alchemy to modern chemistry can be called a paradigm shift...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{years ago}} I had the {{pleasure}} of being taught by Aaron Posner. Mr. Posner was a great teacher. He made a statement that stuck with me <b>till</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> <b>day.</b> He stated, "An actor that knows himself will truly be unique. " Although this statement stood out I honestly didn't understand it until my professional acting days. Preceding my undergraduate years and just before my education started here at UCSD, I {{had the pleasure}} of working with many experienced actors. My first professional job was Fences, a play by August Wilson. I had the honor of working with Stephanie Berry and Raymond Anthony Thomas. The brilliance of these two actors came from the essence of who they are not only as actors but as individuals. I greatly admired their performances. It was unique. One day I asked both Stephanie Berry and Anthony Thomas, "How were they able to maintain their consistent acting ablities?" Their response was that they utilized their very own life experiences and knowledge to get them through their roles on stage. Those words stayed with me, and made me look at my life and my experiences differently and reflect upon them on stage as well. Those encouraging words brought me to the next phase in my life, which was growing and improving my talent here at UCSD. I wanted to really focus on developing myself by fully getting to know me and utilize my experiences in my work consistently. I arrived at UCSD in September 2008 and I can honestly say I have had a blessed three years. I have worked with professors that have pushed me to find the essence of each character within myself for every single rehearsal and every single performance. I have done eight plays in the program, and each time I was given a new opportunity to discover my uniqueness. With the help of my dedicated professors I am proud to say I have found my purpose in my art. I am so eager now {{to go out in the}} world to grow, transform, and make an imprint...|$|E
