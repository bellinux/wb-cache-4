25|$|We {{were in the}} {{universe}} of the teenage movie. Teenage reality. So we said here’s what’s going to be weird about the world of our movie: No one’s {{going to be over}} 30. The world is a high school, essentially. And Tom Cody will be the football hero. And Willem Dafoe is the greaser. Remember: You had John Hughes at the time, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> Coppola making two high school movies: The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. So Walter said we’re going to make a high school movie that’s also going to be a comic book and also going to be a musical.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} with Araya, when asked, [...] "Did critics realize you were wallowing in parody?" [...] Araya replied, [...] "No.People {{thought we were}} serious!...back <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose." [...] Araya also denied rumors that Slayer members are Satanists, but they find the subject of Satanism interesting and [...] "we are all on this planet to learn and experience." ...|$|E
500|$|The band used Satanic {{themes in}} both lyrics and live {{performances}} to gain notice among the metal community. The back cover featured 'side 666' and inverted crosses, with Hanneman playing his guitar. Due to the imagery and lyrical content, Slayer received mail from the Parents Music Resource Center telling the band to stop releasing records. [...] Araya comments, [...] "Back <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart. When in actuality you're {{trying to create}} an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose." [...] The album produced the songs [...] "The Antichrist", [...] "Die by the Sword", and [...] "Black Magic", which are played at Slayer's live shows regularly.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally it {{has been}} assumed that the {{prevalence}} of woodblock printing in East Asia {{as a result of}} Chinese characters led to the stagnation of printing culture and enterprise in that region. S. H. Steinberg describes woodblock printing in his Five Hundred Years of Printing as having [...] "outlived their usefulness" [...] and their printed material as [...] "cheap tracts for the half-literate, ... which anyway had to be very brief because of the laborious process of cutting the letters." [...] John Man's The Gutenberg Revolution makes a similar case: [...] "wood-blocks were even more demanding than manuscript pages to make, and they wore out and broke, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to carve another one - a whole page at a time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{that was}} {{attributed}} {{to the fact that}} in the fourth season Willis and Shepherd had little screen time together. [...] Jay Daniel explained that, [...] "we had to do episodes where there was no Cybill. She was off having twins. Her scenes were shot early, early on and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to integrate them with scenes shot weeks later. You were locked into what those scenes were because of what had already been shot with Cybill." [...] Bruce Willis was also making Die Hard during this period. When that movie became a box office success, a movie career beckoned and his desire to continue in a weekly series waned. In a series that depended on the chemistry between the two main stars, not having them together for the bulk of the fourth season hurt the ratings.|$|E
