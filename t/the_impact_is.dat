5|$|The {{autonomic}} or involuntary nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in perspiration and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. Autonomic nervous system involvement can affect even those who do not have severe muscle weakness.|$|E

25|$|The Andromeda Galaxy — {{also known}} as M31 or Messier 31 — is a giant spiral galaxy which {{approaches}} us at about 300 kilometres per second, so {{it is one of}} the few blue shifted galaxies. It is unknown whether it will collide with the Milky Way galaxy, but if <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> to happen, it is predicted to occur in about 3 billion years. In that case the two galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy.|$|E
25|$|As {{the shock}} wave decays, the shocked region decompresses towards more usual {{pressures}} and densities. The damage {{produced by the}} shock wave raises {{the temperature of the}} material. In all but the smallest impacts this increase in temperature is sufficient to melt the impactor, and in larger impacts to vaporize most of it and to melt large volumes of the target. As well as being heated, the target near <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> accelerated by the shock wave, and it continues moving away from the impact behind the decaying shock wave.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} impact of inadequate sanitation has been estimated at 344 billion Rupees (US$5.7 billion), equivalent to almost 4 percent of GDP. 87% of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> on health, 5% on increased costs of water supply and 8% are other impacts. The main health impacts are premature mortality and productivity losses, followed by treatment costs. Water supply costs include higher costs for the supply of piped water, higher expenses for bottled water {{and the cost of}} household water treatment. Other costs include the cost of increased time for open defecation and the use of shared toilets, and a relatively small cost of lost tourism revenues. Many intangible costs {{were not included in the}} estimate, such as the lack of privacy, security, status and dignity. The cost of environmental conditions stemming from poor sanitation was also not included in the estimate.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{bacteria}} in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars and starches. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel. This process, known as [...] "demineralisation", leads to tooth destruction. Saliva gradually neutralises the acids which cause the pH of the tooth surface {{to rise above the}} critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes 'remineralisation', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.|$|E
500|$|In September 2016, it was {{discovered}} that the encryption of local iOS backups made with iTunes is weaker for iOS 10 devices than for devices running iOS 9. Russian software firm ElcomSoft discovered that the iOS 10 backup process skips several security checks, making it [...] "approximately 2,500 times" [...] faster to try passwords, enabling 6 million password tries per second compared to the 2,400 password tries per second for the same process ElcomSoft has used on iOS 9. The firm stated that <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> [...] "severe". Apple acknowledged the problem, said it planned to issue a security update, but also stated that iCloud backups were not affected. The iOS 10.1 update subsequently fixed the issue.|$|E

40|$|A thermal-infrared {{image of}} Comet Giacobini-Zinner {{has been used}} to {{determine}} the spatial distribution of dust grains in the Comet's coma. In the present paper the results of this imaging which bear on <b>the</b> expected <b>impact</b> rate of dust grains on the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) <b>are</b> emphasized. <b>The</b> expected <b>impact</b> rate <b>is</b> calculated for a range of grain radii. For particle sizes comparable to those inferred for most comets, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> rate <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> order of several hundred per second. This rate is in agreement with the predictions by Divine (1985), but it is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the rate observed by ICE if <b>the</b> observed <b>impacts</b> <b>were</b> on <b>the</b> spacecraft body. However, <b>the</b> observed <b>impact</b> rate <b>is</b> roughly comparable to that inferred from the infrared imaging if, as suggested by Gurnett et al.

500|$|Worldwide, horses play a {{role within}} human {{cultures}} and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There {{are estimated to be}} 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone. The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> over $102 billion.

500|$|The {{eruption}} {{devastated the}} nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini, which was entombed in {{a layer of}} pumice. It is believed that the eruption also severely affected the Minoan population on Crete, but the extent of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>is</b> debated. Early theories proposed that ashfall from Thera on {{the eastern half of}} Crete choked off plant life, causing starvation of the local population. However, after more thorough field examinations, the theory has lost credibility, as it has been determined that no more than [...] of ash fell anywhere on Crete. Other theories have been proposed based on archeological evidence found on Crete indicating that a tsunami, likely associated with the eruption, impacted the coastal areas of Crete and may have devastated the Minoan coastal settlements. Another theory is that much of the damage done to Minoan sites resulted from a large earthquake and the fires it caused, which preceded the Thera Eruption.|$|E
2500|$|The {{likelihood}} that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact.

It {{should be pointed out}} that it is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called [...] "residual risk".|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{economic}} <b>impact</b> of smoke-free {{legislation on}} sales turnover in restaurants and pubs in Tasmania Tasmania {{has a population}} of approximately 473 400 —about 4 % of the population of Australia—and around 320 bars (known in Australia as ‘‘pubs’’) and licensed clubs and 400 restaurants and cafes. Legislation came into force there on 1 September 2001 to mandate smoke-free enclosed work and public places, with exemptions for bar and gaming areas where meals are not served or consumed. Our study assessed <b>the</b> economic <b>impact</b> of introducing smoke-free polices in Tasmania on sales in bars, licensed clubs, restaurants, and cafes. We used seasonally adjusted monthly sales data from January 1990 to September 2002 and statistically controlled for trends and random fluctuations. Three distinct hypotheses about the nature of <b>the</b> economic <b>impact</b> <b>are</b> examined. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> abrupt and permanent; it resulted in a sudden and permanent shift in the level of sales. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>was</b> gradual and permanent; it resulted in a gradual change in sales and this accumulated effect <b>was</b> permanent.
