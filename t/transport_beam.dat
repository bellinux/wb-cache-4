Plasma-channel-based <b>beam</b> <b>transport</b> is a promising final transport concept {{which has been}} studied at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in recent years. Aspects of ion <b>beam</b> <b>transport</b> in plasma channels are studied with the <b>beam</b> <b>transport</b> experiment at GSI which is described in this work. Its original setup and recent extension of channel length are discussed. In this experiment, plasma channels are formed by a high-voltage discharge in a background gas. Two methods of channel initiation are investigated: ion beam initiation and laser initiation. The latter uses a laser to create favorable conditions for a discharge along the axis; the former uses the ion beam itself. The properties of ion-beam-induced plasma channels in several gases are studied {{for a wide range}} of pressure and voltage for the extended channel length of approximately 1 m. A comparison of different background gases shows that high-Z noble gases are more suitable to create channels for <b>beam</b> <b>transport</b> than low-Z noble gases or nitrogen. The mechanism and limits of laser-initiated discharges with the experimental setup available are discussed. The experiment uses the combination of ammonia gas and a CO 2 laser. The parameter range of the two initiation methods and their differences are compared. While laser initiation requires a specific combination of laser and gas, ion-beam-induced channels are theoretically possible with any gas. For final <b>beam</b> <b>transport</b> in a heavy-ion-beam-driven fusion reactor, it is important that the beam quality does not decrease during <b>beam</b> <b>transport.</b> The most important measure of beam quality is the beam emittance.
