5|$|Like Caroline herself (who {{was created}} Baroness Vaughan upon {{the birth of}} their first son), the two boys were granted {{courtesy}} titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate. Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, the two boys were adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the age of}} twelve, {{he studied}} under Issachar Ber in Lyubavichi (Lubavitch); he {{distinguished}} himself as a Talmudist, such that his teacher sent him back home, informing his father that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> continue his studies {{without the aid of}} a teacher.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{experiences}} two separate flashbacks that reveal {{the true nature}} of the Origami Killer. The first takes place 34 years earlier, with two twin brothers playing in a construction site. One of the two, John Sheppard, falls into a broken pipe and gets his leg trapped, just as a rainstorm causes the pipe to begin filling with water. The second occurs shortly after, with John's brother running home to warn their father, only to find him too drunk to help. Scared and confused, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> only watch helplessly as his brother drowned. Thus, the Origami Killer was born: a killer who searches for a father willing to sacrifice himself. He kills his victims the same way his brother died. The boy turns out to be Scott; after he reached adulthood, he changed his surname to Shelby. His actions as an investigator are not meant to get justice for his victims; rather, he needed to collect the evidence of his crimes, which he burns in his office wastebasket.|$|E
60|$|When <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> stop laughing, they {{translated}} Tim's appeal.|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} two men {{looked at each other}} and murmured {{something}} <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> not catch.|$|R
60|$|The {{matter was}} talked over a while longer, but <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> learn little {{further from the}} foreman.|$|R
500|$|Braille {{was helped}} by the Haüy books, but he also despaired over their lack of depth: the amount of {{information}} kept in such books was necessarily small. Because the raised letters were made in a complex artisanal process using wet paper pressed against copper wire, the children could not hope to [...] "write" [...] by themselves. So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet made from bits of thick leather. It was a slow and cumbersome process, but <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> at least trace the letters' outlines and write his first sentences.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{returned}} to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, {{but at the same}} time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as [...] "borderline" [...] or [...] "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.|$|E
2500|$|Other criticisms {{surround}} {{what the}} project didn't do. [...] Wente had {{noted that the}} mummies of both Tut and KV55 bore a very strong cranofacial similarity to the mummy of Thutmose IV, yet this mummy was not tested. [...] Dylan Bickerstaffe calls it [...] "almost perverse" [...] that the mysterious [...] "boy on a boat" [...] found in KV35 was not tested while the [...] "Elder Lady" [...] and [...] "Younger Lady" [...] found there were. [...] <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> very well be Akhenaten's older brother Prince Thutmose or even Smenkhkare given that the KV35 ladies are now known {{to be related to}} Tut.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> {{do nothing}} on deck, and so went below again, {{to find that}} the former {{supercargo}} had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{question}} neither of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> answer, and after some thought Master Dean agreed {{to make the necessary}} inquiries without delay.|$|R
50|$|Exy and Irving had two children, Robert and Arthur. As soon as <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> walk they boarded {{ship and}} began to sail with the family.|$|R
2500|$|Auer {{was born}} in 1866 in Nyack, New York, the fifth of five {{children}} of Joseph Auer, a stable owner and harness maker. [...] When he was sixteen years old, Auer joined the United States Navy {{because he wanted to}} see the world. [...] After completing basic training he was assigned to the , the flagship of the European Squadron as a Seaman Apprentice. [...] On November 20, 1883, while the Lancaster was in port in Marseille, France, a young Frenchman who was on a stone pier astern of the Lancaster fell overboard, and disappeared below the water twice. [...] Seeing him, and realizing that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not swim, Auer jumped into the water together with Boatswain's Mate Matthew Gillick, {{and they were able to}} rescue the boy. [...] For their heroism, both Auer and Gillick were awarded the United States' highest military decoration for gallantry, the Medal of Honor, on February 2, 1884. [...] Before Seaman Auer left the Navy, the medal was stolen, though he wore the ribbon (and retained the citation) until his final years.|$|E
2500|$|On January 2, 1864, {{witnesses}} {{were called to}} testify against Dodd. Pvt. Daniel Goldberg testified that he tore up Dodd's pass because [...] "he did not need a pass anymore". Sgt. Frederick Miehr testified that he arrested Dodd after <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not produce a pass. 1st Lt. C.F. Stopral found Dodd's memoranda book, discovered that the Morse code reported the positions and armaments of the 3rd Ohio Battery and 11th Ohio Battery and {{sent him to the}} guardhouse. Capt. George Hanna testified that he interrogated Dodd and discovered that he was carrying one pocketbook containing Louisiana money, Confederate money, ten dollars in greenbacks and some Confederate postage stamps; one postal currency holder, one loaded Derringer pistol and a package between his shirts containing letters. Capt. John Baird testified that, per Hanna's orders, he took the prisoner and the papers into Little Rock the next morning to Gen. Davidson. Capt. Robert C. Clowery testified that he interpreted the Morse code as containing detailed information about the locations and strengths of Union forces and armaments. First Lt. George O. Sokalski then testified about the actual Union troop strength and weaponry, which was a match to Dodd's coded message.|$|E
2500|$|Property law governs {{ownership}} and possession. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership {{of land and}} things attached to it. Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|E
60|$|That Jack Blowfen {{was having}} a fierce hand-to-hand contest with his {{antagonist}} was plain. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> hear both men thrashing around at a lively rate.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> {{not hear}} <b>the</b> short {{conversation}} which followed; but their surprise increased as {{the order was}} given to lower away one of the port boats.|$|R
60|$|If Master Roberts {{had been}} a veritable giant seeking whom he might devour, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> not have shown more fear lest his command should not be obeyed.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> recover {{himself to}} thank his superior, the latter had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|And then, before <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> ask {{any more}} questions, the bird flew away {{and left him}} alone.|$|E
60|$|More {{than this}} <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not tell {{and he was}} excused. Squire Haggerty {{shook his head in}} perplexity.|$|E
60|$|That {{the horses}} {{had been stolen}} there {{could no longer be}} any doubt, and how they could be {{recovered}} was just what neither of <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> decide.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> {{see that}} <b>the</b> boa's tail was {{fastened}} firmly around a tree, thus {{giving him a}} purchase such as the jaguar would have difficulty in overcoming.|$|R
60|$|The {{evening was}} spent in playing various games and in singing some of the home songs. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> sing fairly well and Jed Sanborn listened with pleasure.|$|R
60|$|He {{would gladly}} have escorted them home, but as <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not yet stand, {{he was forced}} to carry him.|$|E
60|$|Each time {{something}} in his face struck the youth as decidedly familiar. Yet, try his best, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not place the fellow.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a note}} in French, in thin, flimsy foreign {{handwriting}} that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> not decipher. He stared {{blankly at}} the paper.|$|E
6000|$|The steamer was {{to leave}} at nine o'clock. <b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> see her lying at the pier, {{about half a mile}} distant from them. The air was misty, and there were some small trees in the way, but <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> see <b>the</b> chimney distinctly. They dressed {{themselves}} as soon as they could, and went to Mr. George's room. They knocked gently at the door. Mr. George said, [...] "Come in." [...] They went in and found Mr. George seated at a table, writing in his journal. It was about seven o'clock.|$|R
60|$|Nat Poole was a {{sight to}} behold in a well-worn suit several sizes too big for him, and <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> not help but laugh {{when he made his}} appearance.|$|R
60|$|During {{the evening}} Joe {{tried very hard}} to appear jolly and {{perfectly}} at ease; but <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> not simulate cheerfulness, and the hours passed wearily despite their companion's efforts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you no chance?" [...] said Miss Fosbrook, {{without taking}} notice of this rudeness, for {{she saw that}} <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> hardly contain himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That won't {{save you}} from Ugu the Shoemaker," [...] {{declared}} the White Rabbit, and it scurried away before <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> ask any more questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "All the {{difference}} in the world," [...] said the papa; and he laughed, and ran out of the library before <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>could</b> get at him.|$|E
60|$|More {{than that}} Cummings would not say: but both <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> plainly {{see he was}} very anxious, and all grew greatly distressed in mind as the hours wore on.|$|R
6000|$|Before many minutes, however, <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> {{see that}} {{those at the}} house were {{shouting}} to them, and when they arrived within hearing distance, they recognized Bob's voice, as he shouted: ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{more words}} followed, but spoken {{so low that}} <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>could</b> not {{understand}} them. They heard a faint creaking of the flooring of the old mill, but that was all.|$|R
