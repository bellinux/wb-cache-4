40|$|Carex lepidocarpa {{grows in}} {{isolated}} and scattered areas throughout the country, wherever suitable localities occur. It shows considerable variation {{in form and}} size over its range, but this can usually be correlated with its different habitats, and its regional adaptation to climate and topography. In fact this species seems to form a discontinuous <b>topocline</b> in the British Isles (Huxley, 1939) and the character gradient {{in this case is}} clearly associated with latitude and altitude. Thus the southern lowland and Scottish mountain plants represent the extreme forms. The former, confined to the fens and calcareous marshes in southern England, {{is very different from the}} latter, a plant of base-rich flushes on high mountains, and these forms remain distinct even in cultiva-tion. However, as some populations in the Midlands and northern England (the carboni-ferous limestone of the Pennines, in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Durham and Westmorland) show intermediate characters and are difficult to classify, it seems best to regard these extreme forms as subspecies. A short description of the species and the two subspecies found in the British Isles now follows...|$|E
