40|$|In the {{telecommunications}} sector product development must minimise {{time to market}} while delivering high levels of dependability, availability, maintainability and scalability.

40|$|Currently most {{distributed}} <b>telecoms</b> <b>software</b> is engineered using low and mid-level distributed technologies, {{but there}} is a drive to use high-level distribution. This paper reports the first systematic comparison of a high-level distributed programming language in the context of substantial commercial products. Our research strategy is to reengineer some C++/CORBA telecoms applications in Erlang, a high-level distributed language, and make comparative measurements. Investigating the potential advantages of the high-level Erlang technology shows that two significant benefits are realised. Firstly, robust configurable systems are easily developed using the high-level constructs for fault tolerance, and distribution. The Erlang code exhibits resilience: sustaining throughput at extreme loads and automatically recovering when load drops; availability: remaining available despite repeated and multiple failures; dynamic reconfigurability: with throughput scaling near-linearl...|$|R
