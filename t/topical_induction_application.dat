40|$|The {{early growth}} {{response}} gene, Egr- 1 (NGFI-A, krox 24, zif 268, TIS 8), {{is a member}} of a family of genes with suggested importance in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Retinoic acid has been shown to markedly induce Egr- 1 gene expression in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells and rat preosteoblastic cells. In this study we demonstrate that treatment of cultured human skin fibroblasts with retinoic acid results in a rapid transient four-fold induction of Egr- 1 transcripts, being maximum at 60 mm and returning to a basal level by 120 mm. However, treatment of cultured human keratinocytes with retinoic acid did not significantly induce Egr- 1 transcripts. Expression of Egr- 1 message in keratinocytes was observed to be induced by fetal bovine serum and tetra-decanoyl phorbol acetate, whereas calcium, 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate caused little or no <b>induction.</b> <b>Topical</b> <b>application</b> of 0. 1 % retinoic acid cream in vivo resulted in a two- to threefold induction of Egr- 1 transcripts following treatment for 24 and 48 h, returning to nearly basal levels by 96 h. Taken together, these data are consistent with the possibility that Egr- 1 is a proximal component of an intracellular molecular cascade that may give rise to alterations in cell phenotype in response to retinoic acid...|$|R
40|$|Sunburn {{cells are}} thought to {{represent}} ultraviolet B-induced apoptotic keratinocytes. It has been demonstrated that enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants effectively suppress sunburn cell formation, indicating that reactive oxygen species {{may play a role}} in the progression of ultraviolet B-induced apoptosis. Metallo-thionein, a cytosol protein, has antioxidant activity, and overexpression of metallothionein has been reported to reduce the number of sunburn cells in mouse skin. We have also demonstrated that overexpression of metallothionein inhibits ultraviolet B-induced DNA ladder formation in mouse keratinocytes. These findings support the hypothesis that cellular metallothionein may play an important role in the inhibition of ultraviolet B-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes through its antioxidant activity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of β-thujaplicin, an extract from the woods of Thuja plicata D. Don. and Chamaecyparis obtuse, Sieb. et Zucc., on ultraviolet B-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes and on metallothionein <b>induction.</b> <b>Topical</b> <b>application</b> of β-thujaplicin decreased the number of ultraviolet B-mediated sunburn cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells in mouse ear skin. Incubation with β-thujaplicin suppressed ultraviolet B-induced DNA ladder formation in cultured mouse keratinocytes. Histochemical analysis showed that topical application of β-thujaplicin induced metallothionein protein in mouse skin. Northern analysis and western blotting revealed significant induction of metallothionein mRNA and metallothionein protein, respectively, in β-thujaplicin-treated cultured mouse keratinocytes. These findings indicate that β-thujaplicin inhibits ultraviolet B-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes and strongly suggest that the inhibitory mechanism is due to the antioxidant activity of metallothionein induced by the agent...|$|R

40|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{maximization}} test (GPMT) {{has been used}} as a method for the prediction of skin sensitizing potential for over 30 years. Besides hazard identification, risk assessment of sensitizing chemicals requires the assessment of potency. For the determination of potency based on lowest effective dose levels, dose-response studies are required. In the standard GPMT a single concentration is used for intracutaneous and <b>topical</b> <b>induction</b> and the assay provides a qualitative assessment of allergenicity. This paper presents data derived from quantitative evaluation of the sensitizing potency of chemicals in the GPMT, based on multiple concentrations. We performed the GPMT in accordance with the original procedure of Magnusson and Kligman; and included in this procedure a range of intradermal and <b>topical</b> concentrations for <b>induction.</b> Three allergens with different sensitizing potencies, diethylamine (DEA), tetramethyl thiuram disulfide (TMTD) and zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate (ZDMC) were tested. The data obtained with this test procedure were compared to data we previously obtained using the local lymph node assay (LLNA). Both the GPMT and the LLNA showed dose response relationships for the three chemicals tested. For the chemicals tested, both tests differed in the relative potencies based on benchmark concentrations. While both tests ranked DEA as the least potent allergen, the GPMT ranked ZDMC more potent than TMTD, the reverse being found in the LLNA. The nature of the data provided in the LLNA makes it likely that benchmarks as defined with this test are more reliable than that defined in the GPMT.

40|$|Induction heating is a {{well-known}} technique to produce very high temperature for applications. A large number of topologies have been developed in this area such as voltage and current source inverter. Recent developments in switching schemes and control methods have made the voltage-source resonant inverters widely used in several applications that require output power control. The series-resonant inverter needs an output transformer for matching the output power to the load but it carry high current as a result additional real power loss is occur and overall efficiency also is reduced.

These inductor configurations are multiphased and come from the well known 50 Hz (or 60 Hz) 3 -phase asynchronous motor.

This double phase inductor, which is based on the “single phase asynchronous motor” is then able to produce a middle or high frequency travelling field.

The design is based on newly developed control approach for resonant LLC DC-DC converters by NXP Semiconductors. The approach reduces the close loop transfer function of resonant converter to first order enabling control of resonant networks with very high quality factors. Additionally, the developed control idea regulates the power delivered to load in every cycle without the need of a power feedback. In that way the controller alleviates problems associated with power measurement and control in <b>induction</b> heating <b>application,</b> especially at high quality factors.

However, several side effects were reported that increased {{the risk of heart}} failure. We used C 2 C 12 myoblasts to investigate the role of PPARs and their transcriptional activity during myotube formation. The role of mechanical stretch during myogenesis was also explored by applying cyclic stretch to the differentiating C 2 C 12 myoblasts with 10 % strain deformation at 1 Hz. The myogenesis medium (MM), composed of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 2 % horse serum, facilitated myotube formation with increased myosin heavy chain and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) protein expression. The PPAR protein and PPAR response element (PPRE) promoter activity decreased during MM induction. Cyclic stretch further facilitated the myogenesis in MM with increased a-SMA and decreased PPARr protein expression and inhibited PPRE promoter activity.
