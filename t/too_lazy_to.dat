5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer and then get rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman {{military}} command in Constantinople made poor assumptions of Russian intentions. They decided that Russians would be <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> march along the Danube and cross {{it away from}} the delta, and would prefer the short way along the Black Sea coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river Danube, Vidin. It was garrisoned only because the troops, led by Osman Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{after the}} turnips, {{the earth was}} grown with rice plants. The first rice plants were without husk and kernels. The sweet and honey-like rice flourished seeds abundantly. The people {{consumed}} them {{for a very long}} time. But there are people who became greedy and lazy. They took more rice than they needed for one day's meals. They began to take two, four, eight, and sixteen days' of rice reserves as they were <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> take rice everyday. Owing to this, many other creatures began to store and hoard the rice. The generation time for rice plants became slower and slower. Usually, it took only one night for the plant to grow and be ready to be consumed, but by the karmic power the plant began to grow more and more slowly. Also the rice grew in kernels and husks, scattered, which the creatures must work, nurse, maintain, harvest, and cook in order to obtain the white rice.|$|E
500|$|Baconnaise {{has been}} {{featured}} on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart several {{times as a}} repeat joke. In 2009, Jon Stewart used it in a skit that drew negative attention from Seattle Post-Intelligencers Leslie Kelly. Stewart commented, [...] "Baconnaise, {{for people who want}} to get heart disease but, you know, <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> actually make bacon." [...] In 2010, Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J's Foods. According to J's Foods, a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made, but it was declined by Comedy Central. Using it as a prop in a later episode, Stewart referred to Baconnaise as [...] "capitalism's greatest triumph".|$|E

500|$|Uncuts and The Guardians reviews {{were less}} enthusiastic. Uncut {{commented that the}} album sounds dry and superficial, and the songs are too similar {{to each other and}} other Franz Ferdinand songs. The Guardian stated that [...] "if Franz's songwriting is broader than it was, it is still no deeper" [...] and that [...] "they'll keep trying to move your hips because they know they'll never win your heart." [...] This was echoed by the review in the Daily Mail, which {{described}} the album as [...] "a sterile, unwelcoming affair that fails to pack the band's usual punch." [...] Paste was similarly severe, stating that the vocals are [...] "leering", the production [...] "horrific", and that the lyrics [...] "seem to lack both heart and brain" [...] and conclude by writing that [...] "the layoff suggests that Franz is either too confused or <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> move forward".|$|E
500|$|The episode explores Leonard's {{background}} {{and that he}} is [...] "essentially a deadbeat dad". In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Powell revealed that he was inspired to write the episode after reading a critic's review which referred to Leonard as [...] "basically [...] omnipotence" [...] as he is able to conjure any magic he wants, but is <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of his powers. The review spurred an idea for an episode where Leonard would be responsible for dealing with a kid. Powell called the episode's mythology [...] "very bizarre and surreal", but said that they tried to keep the core themes relatable, such as Leonard's relationship with his estranged son. The same day as the episode's original broadcast, a deleted scene from [...] "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] was made available on the official Ugly Americans website. In the half-minute clip, Grimes is shown settling into living his life as a bear.|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E

[...] Homer {{has no choice but}} to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. [...] Mr. Burns suspects him of being a [...] "free-thinking anarchist". [...] Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity. [...] Homer is <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. [...] When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. [...] Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is Michael Jackson (referred to as [...] "the big white guy who thinks he's the little black guy"), and who introduces himself as such. [...] Being unfamiliar with the real Michael Jackson, Homer believes and quickly befriends him.|$|E
500|$|... “Grunge...became an anti-consumerist {{movement}} {{where the}} less you spent on clothes, the more ‘coolness’ you had.” The style did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, [...] " [...] Kurt Cobain was just <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> shampoo", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "This [...] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs {{against the grain of}} the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s." [...] The flannel and [...] "...cracked leatherette coats" [...] in the grunge scene were part [...] "...of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. [...] Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the “manufactured image”, often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.” ...|$|E
500|$|Willie Dixon's [...] "The Red Rooster"/"Little Red Rooster" [...] uses {{elements}} from several earlier blues songs. [...] The theme reflects {{early twentieth century}} folk beliefs in the American South that a rooster contributes to peace in the barnyard. The image of the rooster appears in several blues songs from the 1920s and 1930s, with two particular songs identified as precursors. [...] Influential Delta blues musician Charlie Patton's 1929 [...] "Banty Rooster Blues" [...] contains the verses [...] "What you want with a rooster, he won't crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "I know my dog anywhere I hear him bark", which are analogous to Dixon's [...] "I have a little red rooster, <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> crow 'fore day" [...] and [...] "Oh the dogs begin to bark". Some of the lyrics to Memphis Minnie's 1936 acoustic combo blues [...] "If You See My Rooster (Please Run Him Home)" [...] are also similar. [...] For example, she sings [...] "If you see my rooster, please run 'im on back home", while Dixon uses [...] "If you see my little red rooster, please drive 'im home". [...] Additionally, similar melody lines are found in both songs. [...] For her recording, Memphis Minnie does a full-throated imitation of a rooster's crow. Mimicking animal sounds later became a feature of several recordings of [...] "Little Red Rooster".|$|E

500|$|After the {{recording}} of [...] "Crazy for You", the soundtrack single for the 1985 coming of age drama Vision Quest, Madonna approached John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to produce another of her self-written songs called [...] "Gambler". Subsequently, the song {{was added to the}} soundtrack of the film, as music producer Phil Ramone felt that it would be appropriate for using in the beginning shots of the film. Madonna explained that the track [...] "is really the girl's point of view, because she's, like, an unstoppable person... She doesn't really need this guy". As the song was recorded on the Geffen label, a commercial issue of the single, in the United States was suppressed, at the request of Madonna's Sire Records management. They feared that commercial availability of another Madonna single would have been detrimental to the other singles from the Like a Virgin album, and the already available, Geffen-distributed, [...] "Crazy for You". Hence [...] "Gambler" [...] was never released, or sent for airplay in the United States. The UK 12" [...] single, contained the Extended Dance Mix, Instrumental Remix, and the song [...] "Nature of the Beach" [...] by Black 'n Blue. [...] The 7" [...] single had the original version, and [...] "Nature of the Beach". The video for [...] "Gambler" [...] is similar to [...] "Crazy for You", with Madonna singing the song along with clips culled from Vision Quest. Madonna filmed her performance on November 22, 1983, at the Big Foot Tavern in Spokane, Washington. [...] "Gambler" [...] remained Madonna's last single written entirely by herself for over two decades, until [...] "Hey You" [...] (2007). According to Stylus Magazine, Madonna said that she got <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> write songs without help.|$|E

5000|$|Sins of the Fleshapoids is a 1965 {{underground}} film {{directed by}} Mike Kuchar.

2500|$|George is neurotic, self-loathing and {{dominated}} by his parents, yet also prone to occasional periods of overconfidence that invariably arise {{at the worst}} possible time. [...] Throughout Seinfelds first season, George is depicted as moderately intelligent – at one point, he mentions an intellectual interest in the Civil War and, in some early episodes, appears almost as a mentor to Jerry – but becomes less sophisticated, {{to the point of}} being <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> even <b>to</b> read a ninety-page book (Breakfast at Tiffany's), preferring to watch the movie adaptation at a stranger's house instead. However, one Chicago Tribune reviewer noted that, despite all his shortcomings, George is [...] "pretty content with himself".|$|R
2500|$|Debussy also {{planned a}} version of Shakespeare's As You Like It with a {{libretto}} by Paul-Jean Toulet, but the poet's opium addiction meant he was <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> write the text. Two other projects suggest Debussy intended to challenge German composers on their own ground. Orphée-Roi (King Orpheus) {{was to be a}} riposte to Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, which Debussy considered to [...] "treat only the anecdotal, lachrymose aspect of the subject.". But, according to Victor Lederer, for [...] "shock value, neither [...] tops the Tristan project of 1907 [...] According to Léon Vallas, one of Debussy's early biographers, its 'episodic character... would have been related to the tales of chivalry, and diametrically opposed to the Germanic conception of Wagner.' That Debussy entertained, if only for a few weeks, the idea of writing an opera based on the Tristan legend is quite incredible. He knew Wagner's colossal Tristan und Isolde as well as anyone, and his confidence must have been great indeed if he felt up to treating the subject." [...] However, nothing came of any of these schemes, partly because the rectal cancer which afflicted Debussy from 1909 meant that he found it increasingly hard to concentrate on sustained creative work. Pelléas would remain a unique opera.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} a negative review in Variety; critic Justin Chang characterized {{the film as}} [...] "a high-energy, low-impact caper-comedy that labors to bring a measure of wit, romance and glamour to an overworked spy-thriller template". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his review of the film with, [...] "Bottom Line: Logic and plausibility take a holiday in this nonstop actioner that counts on stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to sell the nonsense." [...] Honeycutt wrote of the writing, [...] "the script is <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> develop any of its characters – {{and that includes the}} leads", and commented, [...] "laziness permeates the film from the inexplicable escapes to the neglected romance". Knight and Day {{received a}} rating of one and a half stars from a review by Michael Phillips in the Chicago Tribune; which criticized multiple aspects of the film, including its script, directing, cinematography, set pieces, and action sequences. Phillips concluded, [...] "A 21st Century 'Charade' pumped up on all the wrong steroids, 'Knight and Day' may well suffice for audiences desperate for the bankable paradox known as the predictable surprise, and willing to overlook a galumphing mediocrity in order to concentrate on matters of dentistry." [...] Lexi Feinberg of Big Picture Big Sound gave the film a rating of one and a half stars, and characterized it as an [...] "asinine, action-adventure dud", with a [...] "stupid plot". Feinberg commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' is a ludicrous, large-scale failure".|$|E
2500|$|The {{reactions}} of those parodied by MST3K has been mixed. Sandy Frank, {{who held the}} rights to several Gamera films parodied on the show, was [...] "intensely displeased" [...] by the mockery directed at him. (The crew once sang the [...] "Sandy Frank Song", which said that Frank was [...] "the source of all our pain", [...] "thinks that people come from trees", Steven Spielberg [...] "won't return his calls", and implied that he was <b>too</b> <b>lazy</b> <b>to</b> make his own films). Because of this, Frank reportedly refused to allow the shows to be rebroadcast once MST3Ks rights ran out. However, this {{may in fact be}} a rumor, as other rumors indicate that the Gamera films distribution rights prices were increased beyond what BBI could afford {{as a result of the}} show's success. According to Shout Factory, the Japanese movie studio Kadokawa Pictures were so horrified with MST3K's treatment of five Gamera films that they refused to let Shout release the episodes on home video. Brian Ward (one of the members of Shout! Factory) explained to fans on the forums of the official Shout! Factory website that they tried their best to convince them, but the Japanese take their Gamera films very seriously and do not appreciate their being mocked. However, eventually Shout was able to clear the episodes for a special 2011 release due to the rights in North America shifting away from the Japanese to another, North American entity that had no such qualms.|$|E
