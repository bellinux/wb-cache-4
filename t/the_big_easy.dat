25|$|The Yat dialect {{is seldom}} heard when New Orleans is {{depicted}} in movies and television shows. Traditionally, characters portrayed from New Orleans are heard using a southern or Cajun accent.

This trend has been challenged, though, in light of post-Katrina New Orleans representation, like HBO's Treme and Werner Herzog's , both of which feature actual New Orleans locals either speaking in Yat or one of its variations.|$|E
