25|$|The {{next step}} in the gas {{processing}} plant is to remove water vapor from the gas using either the regenerable absorption in liquid <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (TEG), commonly referred to as glycol dehydration, deliquescent chloride desiccants, and or a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit which is regenerable adsorption using a solid adsorbent.

25|$|Natural gas is {{dehydrated}} by {{ethylene glycol}}. In this application, ethylene glycol flows {{down from the}} top of a tower and meets a rising mixture of water vapor and hydrocarbon gases. Dry gas exits {{from the top of the}} tower. The glycol and water are separated, and the glycol recycled. Instead of removing water, ethylene glycol can also be used to depress the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of glycol used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene glycol) is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of glycol used for dehydration (<b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> is typically 95 to more than 99%. Moreover, the injection rate for hydrate suppression is much lower than the circulation rate in a glycol dehydration tower.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for the determination of mono-, di- and <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> in surface waters, based on the oxidation of the glycols to aldehydes. These are made to react with 3 -methylbenzothiazol- 2 -one hydrazone hydrochloride to give green cationic chromogens, which are then measured spectrophotometrically at 630 nm. Sample blank values, to compensate for natural interferences, are obtained by omitting the oxidation stage. The method enables glycol levels of upwards of 0 · 5 mg l– 1 to be determined, satisfactory recoveries of each glycol being obtained for concentrations of 1 to 5 mg l– 1, with a precision of 7 per cent., {{for a range of}} water samples. A sensitive variation of the method, for the determination of monoethylene glycol alone, is described separately...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Conditions of {{synthesis}} of poly(ethylene phosphates) in reaction of H 3 PO 4 with HOCH 2 CH 2 OH (EG), the actual path of polycondensation, {{and structure of}} the obtained polymers (mostly oligomers) and kinetics of reaction are described. Prelimi-nary kinetic information, based on the comparison of the MALDI-TOF-ms and 31 P{ 1 H} NMR spectra as a function of conversion is given as well. Because of the deal-kylation process fragments derived from di- and <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> are also present in the repeating units. Structures of the end groups (CH 2 CH 2 OH or OP(O) (OH) 2) depend on the starting ratio of [EG] 0 /[H 3 PO 4] 0, although even at the excess of EG the acidic end groups prevail because of the dealkylation process.

2500|$|This {{reaction}} can be catalyzed {{by either}} acids or bases, or can occur at neutral pH under elevated temperatures. The highest yields of ethylene glycol occur at acidic or neutral pH {{with a large}} excess of water. Under these conditions, ethylene glycol yields of 90% can be achieved. The major byproducts are the oligomers diethylene glycol, <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> and tetraethylene glycol. The separation of these oligomers and water is energy-intensive.

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} heat-exchanging oil Lutron KS 1, a poly(ethylene glycol) {{containing a}} single benzene {{ring in the}} chain with 1, 3 -substitution, has been characterised by H- 1 and C- 13 NMR spectroscopy, IR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography (SEC); the latter shows it to have a low PDI (1. 06) while H- 1 NMR and MALDI-TOF indicate a peak molecular mass of 816 and 682 respectively. The 20 -fold rise in viscosity of Lutron during industrial use at 170 - 210 degrees C over prolonged periods is shown {{to be due to}} the effect of oxygen in causing degradation to give carbonisation and the release of a range of volatile degradation products including CH 3 CHO, H 2 O, and di- and <b>tri(ethylene</b> <b>glycols).</b> Thermal degradation under N- 2 gives a much more complex array of volatiles, including 18 -crown- 6; the formation of most of these involves simple homolysis followed by disproportionation. The SEC chromatograms of residual Lutron were bimodal, indicating extensive formation of high mass products. The 1 % addition of various well-known antioxidants had only, at best, a marginal effect on reducing the oxygen-induced degradation; the most effective method of extending the service life of Lutron is to exclude oxygen during the heating process.

5000|$|<b>Triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is well {{established}} as a relatively mild disinfectant toward a variety of bacteria, influenza A viruses and spores of Penicillium notatum fungi. However, its exceptionally low toxicity, broad materials compatibility, and low odor combined with its antimicrobial properties indicates that it approaches the ideal for air disinfection purposes in occupied spaces. Much of the scientific work with <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{was done in the}} 1940s and 1950s, however that work has ably demonstrated the antimicrobial activity against airborne, solution suspension, and surface bound microbes. The ability of <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> to inactivate Streptococcus pneumoniae (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), Streptococcus pyogenes (original citation: Beta hemolytic streptococcus group A) and Influenza A virus in the air was first reported in 1943. Since the first report the following microorganisms {{have been reported in the}} literature to be inactivated in the air: Penicillium notatum spores, Chlamydophila psittaci (original citation: meningopneumonitis virus strain Cal 10 and psittacosis virus strain 6BC), Group C streptococcus, type 1 pneumococcus, Staphylococcus albus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens Bizio (ATCC 274). Solutions of <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> are known to be antimicrobial toward suspensions of Penicillium notatum spores, Streptococcus pyogenes (original citation: Beta hemolytic streptococcus Group A [...] ), Streptococcus pneumoniae (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), Streptococcus viridans, and Mycobacterium bovis (original citation: tubercle bacilli Ravenel bovine-type). Further, the inactivation of H1N1 influenza A virus on surfaces has been demonstrated. The latter investigation suggests that <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may prove to be a potent weapon against future influenza epidemics and pandemics.|$|E

50|$|The method {{developed}} by Kishner {{has the advantage}} of avoiding the requirement of a sealed tube, but early variations of Wolff’s procedure involved the use of high-boiling solvents such as <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> to alleviate this necessity.

5000|$|TEG {{is used by}} the oil and gas {{industry}} to [...] "dehydrate" [...] natural gas. It may also be used to dehydrate other gases, including CO2, H2S, and other oxygenated gases. It is necessary to dry natural gas to a certain point, as humidity in natural gas can cause pipelines to freeze, and create other problems for end users of the natural gas. <b>Triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is placed into contact with natural gas, and strips the water out of the gas. <b>Triethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is heated to a high temperature and put through a condensing system, which removes the water as waste and reclaims the TEG for continuous reuse within the system. The waste TEG produced by this process has been found to contain enough benzene to be classified as hazardous waste (benzene concentration greater than 0.5 mg/L).|$|E
5000|$|In the 1940s {{and early}} 1950s, further studies showed {{inactivation}} of diverse bacteria, influenza virus, and Penicillium chrysogenum (previously P. notatum) mold fungus using various glycols, principally propylene glycol and <b>triethylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> [...] In principle, these chemical substances are ideal air disinfectants {{because they have}} both high lethality to microorganisms and low mammalian toxicity.|$|E
