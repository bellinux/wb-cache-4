Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers.

Development of a chipset costs <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

5|$|Time {{constraints}} prevented {{many elements}} from {{appearing in the}} final game. One such missing feature was a fatality system by which Spartans or Covenant leaders could inflict massive damage on large groups of units. Pottinger said that the animations, while interesting, did not mesh with the fast-paced combat of Halo Wars and raised balance concerns. Other elements based on Halo fiction did not work in a strategy game. Although more than 100 people worked on the project, which cost <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> a Covenant campaign was never realized {{because of a lack}} of manpower and money.|$|E

In New York City, student attendance remained extremely low in the days after schools reopened. The New York Public Library was forced to close its main location and all of its 80 branches.

5|$|Spectre grossed $880.7 million worldwide; $135.5 {{million of}} the takings were {{generated}} from the UK market and $200.1 million from North America. Worldwide, this made it the second highest-grossing James Bond film after Skyfall, and the sixth highest-grossing film of 2015. Deadline.com calculated the net profit of the film to be $98.4 million when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film. Sony had expected the net profit of the film to be around $38 million had it performed to {{the same level of}} its predecessor. But since it earned 20 per cent less than Skyfall, the profit in actual was $24.6 million. Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for the film — which totalled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives — but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped. The studio also spent <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> in marketing and had to give MGM a piece of the profit from the studio's non-Bond films, including 22 Jump Street.|$|E
