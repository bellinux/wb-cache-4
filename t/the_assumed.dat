5|$|Generally, <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> role {{of these}} jamaat members cycle {{in a way}} that they may be engaged as a preacher, a cook or as a cleaner at other times. Among Tabligh Jamaat members, this is {{generally}} referred to as khidmat which essentially connotes to serving their companions and freeing them for tablighi engagements. The members of the Jamaat are assigned these roles based on the day's mashwara. The markaz keeps records of each jamaat and its members, the identity of whom is verified from their respective mosques. Mosques are used to assist the tablighi activities of individual jamaats that voluntarily undertake preaching missions. Members of a jamaat, ideally, pay expenses themselves so as to avoid financial dependence on anyone.|$|E

Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.|$|E

At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties. Twenty-one was <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected the rights of the deceased to name an earlier age in his will.|$|E

They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous night for being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty. He estimates, apparently based on reports by the senior remaining French officers on Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave, that those three ships suffered 760 casualties in total. These accounts were subsequently called into question by historian William James, who considered them too high. James also criticised <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding parties on 8 February.|$|E
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> value.|$|E

5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf {{did not respond to}} questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> mythological rules.|$|E
5|$|The biggest off-the-field {{incident}} was revealed {{on the final}} weekend before the Sugar Bowl. Texas reserve defensive back Ron McKelvey was revealed to be using an assumed name. In reality, he was a 30-year-old man named Ron Weaver who had played for a junior-college team and a small-college team under other assumed names. Weaver disappeared prior to the Sugar Bowl, but stated that he had used <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> name in order to gather information for {{a book about the}} inner workings of Texas football. Weaver later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misusing Social Security numbers, but he avoided jail and paid no fine. Texas was not sanctioned by the NCAA, but Longhorns players later said the event was a severe distraction from pre-game preparations.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} skin and the hair. All parts of the animal are used in traditional Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> medicinal value of its hair. Traders have reported that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E

Using <b>the</b> <b>assumed</b> name Big Jack Hollister, Batman travels to San Francisco to meet a contact who explains how the sex tours to Udon Khai operate. As Hollister, Batman travels to Udon Khai, where he meets Rhama, a local translator hired by Alfred. Rhama shows him life in Udon Khai and how the child sex tourism has affected its population. As Batman, Bruce introduces himself to Rhama, saying that Hollister sent him. Batman and Rhama confront a man who buys and sells children and they rescue a girl who had been sold by her family. They return the child to her village and find {{that her father had}} sold her so {{that the rest of the}} poverty-stricken family could survive. The population mistakes Batman for a warrior of legend who would break the barriers that confine the population. Believing this to be their chance for a revolution to overthrow the military dictatorship, a rebel group joins Batman in storming the headquarters of the kingpin who controls the sex tourism industry. Though Batman returns to Gotham City, the rebels continue to dismantle the sex tour industry and overthrow the dictator of Udon Khai.|$|E
