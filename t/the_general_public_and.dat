5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers.

The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best Multi-Platform Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> received increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Navy, the BBC and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from Prince Charles, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.|$|E

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, public schools and many private schools closed, Although no {{mandatory}} evacuations were ordered, multiple shelters were opened in schools and churches and government offices shut down in anticipation of Harvey's onslaught. Several counties issued a state of emergency. Residents prepared individually by, for example, securing boats and lawn furniture. Free sand and sandbags were made available to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> inmates filled bags for those physically {{unable to do so}} themselves. Officials at Lake Manatee began lowering the water level to help avoid flooding. In Hillsborough County the threat of the storm forced the cancellation of local football programs.|$|E
5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E

5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university west of the Mississippi River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal west of the Mississippi River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city – Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E

5|$|Set in {{the grounds}} of Cobdown Park, the Cobdown Sports and Social Club evolved from the former social club for Reeds International, the paper-maker. A new clubhouse was built in 1985 for Reed International Sports and Social Club and in 1989 the club became the Cobdown Sports & Social Club when it {{was taken over by}} the club members. Although it {{remained}} a members club, with many of the same activities, the club was opened up to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> new activities were added. Sports form an important part of these activities, and the club is an important local centre {{with a wide range of}} facilities to cater for groups and organisations, such as schools and businesses. Membership is also open to sports teams that wish to use the club. Facilities include a bar, with snooker and pool tables, a darts board, and a big screen for major sporting events. There is a dedicated function room that is used for social and business events and can accommodate a maximum of 100 people seated.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} was controversial in Lillehammer, both amongst <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> politicians. The chief of administration had doubted {{whether he should}} recommend construction. The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill, but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built, meaning {{that the number of}} competitions in the hill would be severely limited. The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans, which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside, and not enough blasting. To cut costs, a floodlighting system was taken out of the plans, so the venue could not be used during the evenings, limiting the amount of time the venue could be used. It was also a concern that very few locals were able to jump on such a large hill. Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should have been spent instead on an indoor hall for handball. The first trial jump was made by Helge Nordstrand, while Jan Stenbekk is credited with the first hill record, at 110.5meters.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E
