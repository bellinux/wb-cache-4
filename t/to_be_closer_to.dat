5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships within Noasauridae. The specimen CCG 20011 (an as-of-yet unnamed taxon formerly {{referred to the}} tetanuran Chuandongocoelurus), which {{was not included in}} other analyses, was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Elaphrosaurus than Limusaurus, with the three taxa representing Elaphrosaurinae. Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa within Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal to the group of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae within Noasauridae.|$|E

5|$|At a {{birthday}} reception in Windsor Castle, the King states his wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Victoria and insults her mother. But when the King increases Victoria's income, this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues {{her in front}} of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King then sends the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees to make him her private secretary, and he appoints ladies-in-waiting for her from political families allied to him.|$|E
5|$|During 1996 and 1997, Thordendal {{worked on}} his solo album Sol Niger Within, which was {{released}} in March 1997 in Scandinavia and in April in Japan. He also hosted Mats/Morgan Band's debut.

5|$|Her second {{marriage}} was to author Peter Viertel on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel's daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in Klosters, Switzerland and Marbella, Spain, she {{moved back to}} Britain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> her own children as her health began to deteriorate. Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.|$|E
5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small allowance, the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an allowance. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> their husbands, women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1964, {{he ended}} {{his career with}} a {{testimonial}} {{in front of a}} crowd officially numbered at 47,000, though the true figure was estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> 60,000. Trautmann captained a combined Manchester City and Manchester United XI that included Bobby Charlton and Denis Law, against an International XI that included Tom Finney, Stanley Matthews, Ronnie Clayton and Jimmy Armfield.|$|E

5|$|The {{line was}} not a {{financial}} success, and the Lydd Railway was absorbed into the SER in 1895. A passing loop past Appledore was removed in 1920. At the New Romney end, one of the sidings adjoining the station was extended to serve the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. The line was realigned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the coast in the 1930s, opening on 4 July 1937. At the same time, the branch to Dungeness was closed to passengers.|$|E
5|$|When Hickok's {{diabetes}} worsened in 1945, she {{was forced}} to leave her position with the DNC. Two years later, Roosevelt found her a position with the New York State Democratic Committee. When Hickok's health continued to decline, she moved to Hyde Park <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Roosevelt. She lived in a cottage on the Roosevelt estate, where she died in 1968. She is buried at Rhinebeck Cemetery in Rhinebeck, New York.|$|E
5|$|While he {{had worked}} with the University of Calgary Dinos hockey program for a couple seasons {{following}} his retirement, Otto left <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> his family.

Some time after the pair leaves, Ann gives birth to their son Oliver Perkins-Traeger.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Bomb {{engineering}} {{was carried}} out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from Los Alamos. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of Sandia Base. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests. By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia. As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty hand-picked regular officers.|$|E

5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the planet is currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet is more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E
5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without {{a good candidate for}} a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E
