5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held at}} Roma's home ground <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> match as favourites, despite Liverpool's {{previous}} record in the competition. Watched by a crowd of 69,693, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the first half when Phil Neal scored, but Roma equalised before half-time through Roberto Pruzzo. With the scores level at 1–1 through full-time and extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Liverpool won the shoot-out 4–2 to claim their fourth European Cup.|$|E
5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, thanks to a superior goal difference, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game as underdogs due {{to a number of}} their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or suspension, and because they had lost to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw they needed to go to the next stage of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|E
5|$|New York's success {{continued}} in the 1960s. They finished 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle and head coach Allie Sherman, the Giants won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961–1963. In 1961, they were beaten 37–0 by the Packers. In 1962, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> championship game with a league-best 12–2 record and a nine–game winning streak, but they lost to the Packers again, 16–7.|$|E

Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack not to touch it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} battle for Gaza in April 1917, Kress von Kressensteincommander of the victorious 3rd, 16th and 53rd Divisionswas {{reinforced}} by the 7th and 54th Divisions. The 7th Infantry Division (later part of the Eighth Army) had experienced four months of strategic movement, {{similar to that of}} the 54th Division. Having arrived at Jerusalem, in early May the 20th Infantry Regiment began company-level training. After moving to Beersheba where they remained in reserve, they participated in theatre-specific training until late June, when <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front line. Training in fortification, reconnaissance, and counter–reconnaissance continued. The 21st Infantry Regiment received similar training, and on 6 August the regimental colours of the 20th and 21st Infantry Regiments were awarded military medals for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. At Beersheba on 28 June, the 7th Infantry Division inactivated the fourth company of each infantry battalion, before activating a machine gun company armed with light machine guns, in every infantry battalion on 10 August. Every Ottoman infantry division in Palestine repeated this reorganisation, with one quarter of their rifle strength being replaced by light machine guns, considerably increasing their fire power and strengthening their offensive and defensive capabilities. Following orders from von Kressenstein commanding the Gaza to Beersheba line defences, assault detachments equivalent to the German Stosstruppen (Stormtroopers) were formed. The 7th Division activated an assault detachment of fifty men on 17 July 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{enjoyed a}} run of success {{over the next several}} years. Led by league MVP quarterback Charlie Conerly, who passed for 1,706yards, 14 touchdowns, and four interceptions, they {{finished}} 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Conerly struggled with age and injuries in 1960, and was replaced by George Shaw. Gifford was concussed in a vicious hit by Chuck Bednarik during a November game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the rest of the season, and the following season, as a result. The hit was so devastating, that after being taken to the locker room, Gifford was given his last rites. The team still finished with a winning record at 6–4–2, but were led to acquire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Y. A. Tittle in the offseason. Led by Tittle and new head coach Allie Sherman, New York won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961 to 1963. In 1961, they were beaten by the Packers, 37–0 in the championship game. In 1962, <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> championship game with a 12–2 record, and a nine-game winning streak; but lost to the Packers again, 16–7. Nonetheless, the Giants had captivated New York by this time, even though the sold out game was played in single-digit weather with 35mph winds, only 299 of the 65,000+ fans who bought tickets stayed home. Before the 1962 season, Gifford came out of his injury-forced retirement, saying he missed the game too much. He changed positions from halfback to flanker. During the season, Tittle and wide receiver Del Shofner set still-standing team records when Tittle threw for seven touchdowns and Shofner amassed 269 receiving yards in the same game on October 28. After the season, the team traded two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Roosevelt Grier to the Los Angeles Rams at his request; Grier wanted to move to LA to start his singing career.|$|E

They did win, 6–3, but after the premature celebrations had died down, there came the news that their nearest rivals, Queens Park Rangers, had won at Villa Park by virtue of a last-minute own-goal. Q.P.R.'s 0.21 better goal-difference meant they were promoted alongside champions Ipswich Town.|$|E

Otto Krueger, the team's only utility player, was beaned on September 19 and never fully played in the series. 16-game winner Ed Doheny left the team three days later, exhibiting signs of paranoia; he was committed to an insane asylum the following month. Leever had been battling an injury to his pitching arm (which he made worse by entering a trapshooting competition). Worst of all, Wagner, who had a sore thumb throughout the season, injured his right leg in September and was never 100 percent for the post-season.|$|E

This however did not deter the Bagan gaffer, Sanjoy Sen from fielding his first side in the match. The Mariners however lacked motivation and played a defensive game. They failed to create significant positive moves as their opponents found it easier going in the centre of the field. Shillong Lajong had their best chance of the match when Brazilian striker Fábio Pena found an open net in front of him but still ended up hitting the woodwork. The match was fairly uneventful and ended a 0–0 stalemate guaranteeing Mohun Bagan progress on basis of the 5–0 aggregate scoreline.|$|E

25|$|The {{band played}} {{sporadic}} shows {{to support the}} album, which was well-reviewed in UK, but EMI Australia did little to assist them. Without such backing, it was clear {{by the end of}} 1971 that {{they were not going to}} achieve the success they had dreamt of. Although Keays' recollections are more positive, Wheatley's own account of the album sessions is that they were an unhappy experience for him. He had a bad LSD trip the night before <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio and began the recording in a negative frame of mind. Tensions mounted steadily during the recording and Wheatley did not play on some of the tracks, with his parts covered by Ford.
