5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by the shape of <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{agreed to}} head coach again for <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Fighter 6, {{alongside}} then-UFC Welterweight Champion, Matt Serra.

5|$|In 2005, Hughes participated {{as a coach}} {{opposite}} Rich Franklin in {{the second}} season of the Spike TV reality television series, <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Fighter.

In 2007, Hughes participated as a guest coach for long-time friend and training partner, Jens Pulver during <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Fighter 5 season.|$|E
50|$|The {{series was}} {{followed}} by two sequels <b>The</b> <b>Ultimates</b> 2 and <b>The</b> <b>Ultimates</b> 3.

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate.</b> All attempts to state the nature of <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Miles Morales first {{appeared}} in Ultimate Fallout #4 (August 2011), {{following the death of}} Peter Parker. An Afro-Latino teenager, Miles is the second Spider-Man to appear in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint with a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe. Although Morales featured in <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Comics: Spider-Man comic book series, he is not the lead character in <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Spider-Man animated TV series that debuted in April 2012 on Disney XD, but he was later added to the main cast in 2016. After Marvel ended <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> imprint in 2015, Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe, beginning with stories under the All-New, All-Different Marvel brand published that same year.|$|E

50|$|In Ultimate War, Thor {{appears as}} a member of <b>the</b> <b>Ultimates,</b> {{retrieving}} <b>the</b> dead with Iron Man after the attack in issue one. When Magneto attacks <b>the</b> <b>Ultimates,</b> he says he is surprised to see Thor with <b>the</b> <b>Ultimates,</b> and asks him if he thinks he can change them. Thor throws Mjolnir at the Master of Magnetism, but Magneto manages to stop it an inch from his helmet and throws it back at Thor, sending him through a wall.

50|$|Mathematically speaking, however, <b>the</b> Skewb <b>Ultimate</b> has exactly <b>the</b> same {{structure}} as the Skewb Diamond. The {{solution for the}} Skewb Diamond {{can be used to}} solve this puzzle, by identifying the Diamond's face pieces with <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate's</b> corner pieces, and the Diamond's corner pieces with <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate's</b> edge pieces. <b>The</b> only additional trick here is that <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate's</b> corner pieces (equivalent to the Diamond's face pieces) are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed.|$|R

50|$|Similarly, <b>the</b> Skewb <b>Ultimate</b> is mathematically {{identical}} to the Skewb, by identifying corners with corners, and the Skewb's face centers with <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate's</b> edges. <b>The</b> solution of the Skewb can be used directly to solve <b>the</b> Skewb <b>Ultimate.</b> <b>The</b> only addition is that the edge pieces of <b>the</b> Skewb <b>Ultimate</b> are sensitive to orientation, and may require an additional algorithm to orient them after being placed correctly.|$|R

Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships.
