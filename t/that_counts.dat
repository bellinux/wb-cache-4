As the siege continued, Farnese left some troops to blockade Rheinberg and supplied Zutphen in person with 600 cavalry and a convoy of 300 wagons of wheat. Leicester was in Deventer then, but on receiving news of Farnese's approach, he returned to Zutphen's camp. He found, on his arrival, <b>that</b> <b>Counts</b> Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein and William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg had entrenched the army on a hillock along the right bank of the IJssel. Leicester was informed of the possible ways through which the Spanish army might attempt to supply the town, but because of a misunderstanding no troops were deployed to guard the roads.|$|E

5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric can either throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head <b>that</b> <b>counts</b> down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which can either boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E

25|$|Tal was {{a strong}} believer {{in the value of}} {{electronic}} instruments and their potential to transcend the limitations of acoustical means of sound production. Tal regarded electronic music as a new music language, which he describes as unstable and lacking a crystallized definition. He viewed the computer as an instrument which compels the composer to disciplined thinking. In return, it stores the data it was fed with absolute faithfulness. Nevertheless, when the computer is ill-used, the composer's incompetence will be revealed, as he is unable to unite computer with the realm of music. But according to Tal, composing electronic music has another aspect too: when the composer chooses the computer's music-notation as his tool for creating, he concomitantly annuls the performer's role as an interpreter. From that point on, it is only the composer's mental capacity <b>that</b> <b>counts,</b> and the performance is independent of the interpreter's virtuosity.|$|E
