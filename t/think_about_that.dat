5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that).</b> Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond if it had any objections.|$|E

The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How would you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> as a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E
25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

500|$|Leontovych had an {{original}} style. Many {{of his works}} have [...] "deft use of imitative counterpoint" [...] and impressionistic harmony. He had a strong desire for his music to arouse the senses, especially sight, saying, [...] "I'm interested in which colors you used for high tones, and which for the low ones. I myself often <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> to combine sound and color." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Morrison {{regarded}} Street Choir poorly, {{as he told}} biographer Ritchie Yorke in 1973: [...] "Somewhere {{along the}} line I lost control of that album. I'd rather not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> album because it doesn't mean much {{in terms of where}} I was at... the album didn't sell very well and I'm glad." [...] Morrison first lost control of the album before its release, when it was retitled from Virgo's Fool to His Band and the Street Choir: ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a friend}} of Presley's, [...] "their adult {{friendship}} began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend the artist Brett-Livingstone Strong. Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, until it was time for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, [...] "You and me, we could get into a lot of trouble. <b>Think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> girl." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't want to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E
500|$|April 15, 2006, was the 59th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Rachel Robinson {{attended}} the ceremony, having former Negro Leagues players Robert Scott and Armando Vazquez also attending the ceremony. [...] His widow was honored and celebrated at Shea Stadium. After a video tribute on the scoreboard of Shea Stadium of Jackie Robinson, Rachel Robinson {{walked to the}} pitcher's mound before the New York Mets hosted the Milwaukee Brewers, along with Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating officer, and New York Mets manager Willie Randolph. [...] "I've got a picture of Jackie in my office, so I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> every day," [...] Randolph said. [...] "I'm {{just happy to be}} a part of this day." [...] A large blue, gray and white circle with [...] "42" [...] on it was put over home plate representing the colors of Jackie Robinson's uniform with the Dodgers as a major leaguer.|$|E
500|$|She {{was educated}} at Monk's Walk School, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's parents split up when Dixon was four and Dixon's father moved away, {{resulting}} in Dixon later describing her family life as [...] "very dysfunctional". Between {{the ages of}} eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer domestic violence from her partner; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010. Dixon created a documentary for the BBC, Don't Hit My Mum, regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: [...] "When I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good... I believe that every child {{has the right to}} grow up in an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that".|$|E

5000|$|Mrs Doyle {{is taking}} a Lenten pilgrimage to St. Patrick's Hill, to keep her on [...] "the {{straight}} and narrow"; pilgrims take off their socks and climb to the summit before being chased back down with a plank. Before leaving, Mrs Doyle recalls a couple from a previous pilgrimage, who had been obsessed with [...] "the old S-E-X". As Ted is tucking into his sausage, she graphically explains how glad she is <b>that</b> she never <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> kind of thing.|$|R
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
2500|$|When I {{first got}} picked for South Australia, Ian said, [...] "You {{got to decide}} what sort of a player {{you want to be}} – whether you want to be an aggressive, attacking player, or more like a {{grafting}} sort of player." [...] I had to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and that I'm not really a free hitter of the ball, so the choice I made was I was going {{to be more of a}} grafter.|$|E
2500|$|Spin {{wrote that}} Miller's {{influence}} as a songwriter outreached his fame. Miller was credited as an influential {{force in the}} 1980s- and 1990s-era music scenes, beginning in Northern California with bands associated with the Paisley Underground genre, and later influencing better-known independent pop artists. In 1996, Aimee Mann stated that [...] "Scott Miller is the best songwriter out there, in my opinion. I often <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> when I'm writing: 'Would Scott think this song is any good?'" [...] adding [...] "Scott's definitely better than me." [...] Mann confirmed {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "I was very influenced by Scott Miller's songwriting," [...] and [...] "musically, he was a really big influence." ...|$|E
50|$|Meredith and Alex {{are left}} alone in Meredith’s room where Meredith tells Alex he can go. As her new person, he decides to stay and share a bottle of tequila. Meredith goes downstairs to make sure {{everyone}} has left and lock the door, but before she goes back upstairs, Penny runs into her. Penny apologizes once again, saying <b>that</b> she <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> night every single day. She <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> what Meredith said to her and how she needed to be better. Penny offers to put in a request to be matched with a different program, but Meredith responds that she’ll see her Monday and to not be late.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{these early}} events caused Emin {{to be well}} known in art circles, she was largely unknown by the public until she {{appeared}} on a Channel 4 television programme in 1997. The show comprised a group discussion about that year's Turner Prize and was broadcast live. Emin said she was drunk, slurred and swore before walking out. From the interview: [...] "Are they really real people in England watching this programme now, they really watching, really watching it?... They're 25 minutes behind us, <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that...</b> I'm leaving now, I wanna be with my friends, I wanna be with my mum. I'm gonna phone her, and she's going to be embarrassed about this conversation, this is live and I don't care. I don't give a fuck about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Delhomme {{finished}} {{the game with}} 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was obviously commercial, for it kept viewers watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting. [...] "There was a number of reasons for it, one of which was obviously {{that a lot of the}} story was driven from characters in the show not knowing, so it enables those characters to behave truthfully in that situation. And also what I wanted was for every performer to slightly suspect their character, and to really <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and to suspect each other. ... So what you get is ambiguity, and what it also means is that any of the performer or performers who are responsible for what happened aren't flagging it or signaling it in any way whatsoever." [...] The producers discussed the need for secrecy at length during pre-production and agreed it was essential. Chibnall also discussed secrecy issues with directors James Strong and Euros Lyn, and they both agreed to its necessity before coming aboard the project. As roles were cast, Chibnall also explained to each actor that the killer's identity would be kept from them until near the end of the production.|$|E

50|$|Also, Edward urges Anita in the {{beginning}} of the book to have a nice uncomplicated one-night stand with someone, even Bernando. Anita <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> from time to time, even thinking of Ramirez in that light but decides against it when being his girlfriend could compromise her status on the murder cases. Ramirez might be slightly sensitive as well, and Anita notes that maybe she's more attracted to people who aren't entirely human like herself. Anita has thought before that as much as Richard and Jean-Claude embrace and desire her for her somewhat humanity, she embraces their inhumanity.|$|R
5000|$|Korine {{comments}} on the film's pop-aesthetic, saying: [...] "America is all about this recycling, this interpretation of pop. I {{want you to see}} these kids wearing Bone Thugs & Harmony t-shirts and Metallica hats - this almost schizophrenic identification with popular imagery. If you <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that's</b> how people relate to each other these days, through these images." [...] Dot and Helen are modeled after Cherie Currie. [...] "I wanted them to seem like homeschool kids... sort of guessing and coming up with these hipster things. They almost make a homeschool hip language. I wanted this inbred vernacular." ...|$|R
2500|$|With {{almost the}} entire team {{returning}} for the 2012–13 season, expectations were high, and the Bears were ranked #13 in the AP pre-season poll, their highest ranking since 2009. The Bears more than {{lived up to the}} expectations, compiling a 32-4 season record, and ending the regular season with a #6 ranking. The highlight of the regular season was a 67-55 road victory over arch-rival and perennial women's basketball power #4 ranked Stanford. Cal's victory broke an 81-game conference winning streak for the Cardinal. Gottlieb led the Bears to a 17-1 conference record, making them Pac-12 Conference co-Champions—the first conference championship in California Women's Basketball history. The Bears earned a second seed in the NCAA tournament, the Bears' highest tournament seed ever. They defeated Fresno State 90-76 in the first round, and downed South Florida in overtime to advance to the Sweet Sixteen {{for only the second time}} in school history. The Bears beat LSU to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time, and then earned their first trip to the Final Four trip with a thrilling 65-62 overtime victory over Andy Landers' Georgia Bulldogs at the Spokane Arena in Spokane, WA. [...] A tough loss to Louisville in the national semifinal game concluded the team's extraordinary season. [...] "What I said to our team in the locker room is that we can be disappointed about a half a basketball that we wish we had back. We could be disappointed to not be playing on Tuesday night," [...] Gottlieb said. [...] "But I'm going to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> for two minutes, and for the next 10,000 minutes I'm going to think about what this group did for the University of California." ...|$|E
