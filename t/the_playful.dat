25|$|Morath's {{achievements}} {{during her}} first decade of work as a photographer are significant. Along with Eve Arnold, she {{was among the first}} women members of Magnum Photos, which remains to this day a predominantly male organization. Many critics have written of <b>the</b> <b>playful</b> surrealism that characterizes Morath's work from this period. Morath attributed this to the long conversations she had with Cartier-Bresson during their travels in Europe and the United States. Morath's work was motivated by a fundamental humanism, shaped as much by her experience of war as by its lingering shadow over post-war Europe. In Morath's mature work, she documents the endurance of the human spirit under situations of extreme duress, as well as its manifestations of ecstasy and joy.|$|E
25|$|After breakfast, the Prince, {{accompanied}} by <b>the</b> <b>playful</b> Bendicò, goes into his office, which {{is lined with}} century-old paintings of the Salina family's estates. As he sits at his cluttered desk, the Prince recalls how much he dislikes both {{the room and the}} work it represents. This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant and one of his tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|E
25|$|The {{hallmarks}} of Cutler's work are surreal, bizarre juxtapositions and {{close attention to}} small details of existence, all described in seemingly naive language. In performance his delivery was frail, halting and minimally inflected. His writing sometimes edged into whimsy or the macabre. Many of his poems and songs are {{in the form of}} conversations delivered as a monologue. In these, one party is often Cutler as a child, a poetic voice which he adopted in order to bypass the intellect. Cutler describes the poverty of his early life and the neglect he experienced from his parents with great stoicism. He expresses acceptance of his lot and gratitude for the basic elements of life, for nature, and for parental love, even though that love might bear the marks of strain. In these works the humour arises from the child's curiosity and <b>the</b> <b>playful</b> or self-serving lies the parent tells him in instructing him to do a chore or in order to stop the incessant questions.|$|E

[...] The novel celebrates the joy of a traditional wedding ceremony, including <b>the</b> <b>playful</b> ceremonies arranged by children playing dress-up. [...] Roberts' treatment of these themes [...] "validates the dress-up game of playing bride as both fantasy and a stabilizing preface on women's devotion to mate and family".

500|$|The canzonetta {{form was}} much used by composers {{of the day}} as a {{technical}} exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi's first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, <b>the</b> <b>playful,</b> pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi's influence is evident in Monteverdi's use of dissonance. The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse, [...] Torquato Tasso's [...] "Non si levav' ancor", and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: Pietro Bembo's [...] "Cantai un tempo". Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead Cipriano de Rore. Between them is [...] "Ecco mormorar l'onde", strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.|$|E
