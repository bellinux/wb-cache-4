5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a fee to lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes <b>to</b> <b>investors.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Menage {{had begun to}} {{purchase}} land near Puget Sound in Washington, accumulating several thousand acres which he planned to develop into an iron mine, smelter and steel mill, along with housing for the workers. To finance the development he sold an early form of mortgage-backed security <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> in New England and Europe. When the Panic of 1893 occurred, investors found that Menage's properties were fraudulent. Many of the deeds were held by random names taken from the Minneapolis and Saint Paul telephone books, the properties themselves were unimproved, and the payments <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> were being made out of the bank's funds.|$|E
5|$|The Great Southern Group {{began as}} the company Great Southern, co-founded in 1987 by {{accountant}} John Carlton Young, and microbiologist Helen Sewell. It began by managing South-east Australian plantations of Pinus radiata, but in 1992 shifted to Eucalytus plantations for woodchip production, dealing in blue gum woodlot investments. Through the 1990s it developed its plantation business in south western Western Australia including the Great Southern region (after which the company is named), leasing woodlots <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> on land owned by Great Southern. A related entity, Templegate Finance Pty Ltd, would also lend finance <b>to</b> <b>investors.</b>|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of Great Southern's activity was {{in the sale of}} managed investment schemes, in 2007 it diversified into funds management through the purchase of Rural Funds Management Ltd, retaining its diversified agricultural assets fund and offering a new share fund and a blended property fund. In addition to retailing MIS products <b>to</b> <b>investors,</b> Great Southern also provided loans <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> wanting to borrow to invest. By 2009 its loan book comprised 14,500 loans with an average value of approximately A$50,000.|$|E
5|$|Agribusiness MISs offer certain {{advantages}} <b>to</b> <b>investors,</b> dispersing investment risks {{across a}} large pool of investors and, through tax concessions, sharing those risks between the private investor and the taxpayer.

40|$|We use {{differences}} in market-to-book ratios {{between high and}} low corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) firms as a proxy for time-varying investor sentiment for CSR initiatives. We first validate this measure by documenting positive abnormal returns to CSR announcements during periods when investor sentiment is relatively high. We then provide evidence that firms respond <b>to</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment by showing that CSR expenditures are higher during periods when investor sentiment is high. This response is stronger for firms with more powerful incentives <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment due <b>to</b> the investment horizon of the firm and the firm’s shareholders. Additional tests show that future stock returns are lower for firms that respond <b>to</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment, suggesting that CSR activities chosen in response <b>to</b> <b>investor</b> sentiment did not increase long-term shareholder value. Our results provide new insights into our understating of the dramatic increase in CSR-related activities over the last several years. We also extend the behavioral finance literature by showing that managers may undertake costly real actions, such as shifting capital investments toward CSR projects, in order to boost the firm’s short-term stock price...|$|R

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise <b>to</b> <b>investors,</b> which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid <b>to</b> <b>investors.</b> In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and consequently instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. Consequently, toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid <b>to</b> <b>investors</b> were low.|$|E
5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies.

For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers <b>to</b> <b>investors.</b> The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
