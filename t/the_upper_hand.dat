5|$|Whitehead assumed {{command of}} the Fifth Air Force in June 1944, {{although}} he remained subordinate to Kenney. In the Battle of Leyte, MacArthur attempted to move forward beyond the range of land-based aircraft. A long battle of attrition then began {{on the ground and}} in the air, as the Fifth Air Force struggled to gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> with inadequate numbers of aircraft that could be based on Leyte. Gradually, Whitehead gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> He was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 June 1945.|$|E

The following week, {{it was announced}} that Orton would defend the Intercontinental Championship against Edge at Vengeance. Weeks leading to the event, both men took <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> over one another. At the scheduled event, Orton lost the Intercontinental Championship to Edge.|$|E
5|$|As Thebes {{began to}} take <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> Mentuhotep II (c. 2061– c. 2010 BCE), on his {{campaign}} of reunification, brought Thinis, which had been in revolt, possibly at Heracleopolitan instigation and certainly {{with the support of}} an army under the command of the nomarch of Assyut, firmly under his control.|$|E
5|$|Hammurabi {{entered into}} a {{protracted}} war with Ishme-Dagan I of Assyria for control of Mesopotamia, with both kings making alliances with minor states {{in order to gain}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> Eventually Hammurabi prevailed, ousting Ishme-Dagan I just before his own death. Mut-Ashkur the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly.|$|E

60|$|Two persons {{for whom}} the table would not move laid their hands on it firmly and flatly. Two others (for whom it danced) just touched {{the hands of the}} former pair. Any {{pressure}} or push from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hands</b> would be felt, of course, by the under hands. No such pressure was felt, yet the table began to rotate. In another experiment with another subject, the pressure was felt (indeed the owner of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hands</b> was conscious of pressing), yet the table did not move. These experiments are, physiologically, curious, but, of course, they demonstrate nothing. Muscles can move the table, muscles can apparently act without the consciousness of their owner, therefore the movement is caused, or may be irrefutably said to be caused, by unconscious muscular action.|$|R

5|$|Olid next marched inland to the Naco Valley. One of his captains caught González Dávila {{and his men}} by surprise, {{and marched}} them under guard back to Naco, where they were imprisoned. Now that Olid had gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> Briones feared his vengeance for not coming to his support, and pledged his {{allegiance}} to Hernán Cortés. Olid imprisoned Las Casas in Naco with González.|$|E
5|$|Over two weeks, North Korean and South Korean ground units {{fought in}} several bloody back-and-forth battles, taking and retaking ground in which neither {{was able to}} gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> Finally, {{following}} {{the breakdown of the}} North Korean supply lines and amidst mounting casualties, the exhausted North Korean troops were forced to retreat.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Vince McMahon (accompanied by Shane McMahon and Umaga) against Bobby Lashley in a Street Fight for the ECW World Championship. Shane and Umaga {{interfered}} in the match, helping Vince gain the advantage. Shane performed a flying elbow drop, sending Lashley through the announce table at ringside. Back inside the ring, as Umaga {{was holding a}} trash can in front of Lashley's face in the corner, Shane attempted to execute the Coast-to-Coast dropkick; however, Lashley moved away way, and Shane dropkicked the trash can into Umaga's face. Team McMahon kept <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand,</b> as Umaga performed a Samoan Drop onto Lashley, which {{was followed by a}} spear from Vince. Lashley, however, gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> by hitting Vince several times with a steel chair. Lashley performed a spear on Shane and followed with a spear to Vince before pinning Vince to gain the victory and become the new ECW World Champion.|$|E

Orton managed to get <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> over Flair, Batista and Coachman as he delivered an RKO on all of them. Triple H, however, managed to hit Orton with a steel chair, which proceeded with a Pedigree onto the same chair. Batista then rolled the referee into the ring, as Triple H covered Orton for the win via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match of}} the night saw Kane face Edge, during which both men took <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand.</b> Snitsky {{interfered}} in the match, delivering a big boot to Kane.

5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} event {{began with}} a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> when they executed a 3D on Duprée. As D-Von covered Duprée, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|As the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary was taking effect in October 1918, other such units were spontaneously formed on Austrian territory, mainly from rogue components of the Imperial Army. The Romanian Legion of Prague helped the Czechoslovak National Council and the Sokols gain <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> during an anti-Austrian uprising, while other Romanian units were breaking away from Austrian command in Vienna. Romanians also formed a distinct segment of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine personnel who rioted on the Austrian Littoral {{and elsewhere in the}} Adriatic.|$|E

The Joker tries to escape by helicopter, but Batman attaches a heavy granite gargoyle to the Joker's leg with his grappling hook, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death after it breaks off.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1834, the {{imperial}} forces managed to finally repel the Siamese invaders and gained <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>hand</b> over the rebels, regaining {{control of the}} southern countryside and besieging the rebel fortress. Although Khôi died during the siege in November 1834, the rebels defending the citadel of Saigon held out against imperial troops until September, 1835. The rebel commanders put to death. In all, between 500 and 2,000 citadel defenders were captured and executed, including Marchand.|$|E

He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
