5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E

The correlation between <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top 5 percent and the next 15 percent is [...]. 92. This strong correlation means that higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next 15 percent in some states than others are not an indication of greater tax regressivity {{at the top of}} the income distribution. Hence, the revenue-dampening effect of higher <b>burdens</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next 15 percent cannot be interpreted as an effect of regressivity on tax volatility. We suspect that the result is related to the very weak correlation between next- 15 burdens and changes in AGI.|$|R

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced {{at the end of its}} tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding further to <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> the remaining battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left the province to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{was not in}} Bradman's planned Test team. However, the Australian skipper {{changed his}} mind {{on the morning of}} the First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast.

5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is threefold.

We conclude that the widely used tax ratios as developed by Mendoza et al. (1994) may not be very reliable.

5|$|Alan Pattillo, a {{longtime}} scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed to reduce <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to {{the difficulties of}} setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that Thunderbirds contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series. He explained that rapid editing was necessary {{on account of the}} characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest {{for more than a few}} seconds per shot.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the First World War, Rhodesia's white {{population}} was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South Africa, and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South Africa would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> South Africa instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South Africa. For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it would get a better price for its assets from South Africa than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South Africa would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also {{on the side of the}} Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.|$|E
5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and to push {{as far as possible}} toward London. Toward this end, Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County, quartering them for the winter at Winchester, Alresford, Petersfield and Alton. He did so to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> any one town, and because winter was approaching quickly. However, this left his army vulnerable. Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton, and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town as quickly as he could.

5|$|Milton Hay desired {{that his}} nephew go to Washington as a {{qualified}} attorney, and John Hay {{was admitted to}} the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a shabby bedroom. As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day. As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> his secretaries was heavy.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphoria}} {{of securing}} the Ashes preceded Australia's heaviest defeat. At The Oval, England amassed {{a world record}} of 7/903 and their opening batsman Len Hutton scored an individual world record, by making 364. In an attempt to relieve <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> his bowlers, Bradman took a rare turn at bowling. During his third over, he fractured his ankle and teammates carried him from the ground. With Bradman injured and Fingleton unable to bat because of a leg muscle strain, Australia were thrashed by an innings and 579runs, which remains the largest margin in Test cricket history. Unfit to complete the tour, Bradman left the team {{in the hands of}} vice-captain Stan McCabe. At this point, Bradman felt that the burden of captaincy would prevent him from touring England again, although he did not make his doubts public.|$|E

5|$|When White {{took over}} as editor, Amazings {{circulation}} was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; Analog, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> his wife. White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface {{to increase the amount}} of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both Fantastic and Amazing to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was {{shouldering}} most of {{the bowling}} load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties. Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>on</b> Miller. Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185runs and Miller had bowled 70.1overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325, and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads. In the second innings, Miller fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings, for the first time in a Test in 18years.|$|E
