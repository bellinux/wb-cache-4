5|$|In the 21st century, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> nickel {{has led to}} some {{replacement}} of the metal in coins around the world. Coins still made with nickel alloys include one- and two-euro coins, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ U.S. coins, and 20p, 50p, £1 and £2 UK coins. Nickel-alloy in 5p and 10p UK coins was replaced with nickel-plated steel began in 2012, causing allergy problems for some people and public controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E

5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from 238U {{in a series of}} nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton. About {{two thirds of the}} town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed. A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E
5|$|Two drains were built, {{of which}} the most {{successful}} was the Swinefleet Warping Drain, pioneered by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and authorised by an Act of Parliament. Opened in 1821, poor-quality land was reclaimed for around forty years. The other scheme was Durham's Warping Drain, {{to the north of}} Thorne, which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don. The drain was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham, but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors. He died in 1882, just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture. The change was brought about by an agricultural depression and <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> straw for animal bedding.|$|E

5|$|Kasuga was the {{next-to-last}} of the 10 Giuseppe Garibaldi-class armored cruisers to be built. The first {{ship had}} been completed in 1895 and the class had enjoyed considerable export success, and had been gradually improved over the years. The last two ships of the class were ordered on 23 December 1901 by the Argentine Navy {{in response to the}} order by Chile for two second-class battleships. The possibility of war between Argentina and Chile, however, abated before the vessel was completed, and a combination of financial problems and British pressure forced Argentina to dispose of Bernardino Rivadavia and her sister ship Mariano Moreno. The Argentine government attempted to sell the ships to Russia, but negotiations failed over the price demanded by the Argentinians. The Japanese government quickly stepped in and purchased them due to increasing tensions with Russia despite <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> ¥14,937,390 (£1,530,000) for the two sisters. Already planning to attack Russia, the government delayed their surprise attack on Port Arthur that began the Russo-Japanese War until the ships had left Singapore and could not be delayed or interned by any foreign power.|$|E
5|$|Political {{activism}} in American gay communities was {{transformed by the}} arrival of AIDS in the early 1980s. When gay men tried in several desperate measures to follow established political channels to bring attention to a disease that afflicted the most cast out members of society only to meet silence from the government, some used direct action tactics. AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), formed by Larry Kramer and others in 1987, was a response not only to government forces that downplayed or ignored the seriousness of AIDS in the United States, but also to a timid gay community who were not militant enough. Their first act was to march on Wall Street in New York City to protest <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> AZT and the lack of other drugs to address HIV. They blocked morning rush hour traffic, a civil disobedience action in which several protesters were arrested, and the fledgling organization received national news coverage for their demonstration. ACT UP inspired the establishment of direct action groups Queer Nation, Pink Panthers and the Lesbian Avengers, that concentrated on gay and lesbian rights and protection.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 1989, seven ACT UP members {{infiltrated}} the New York Stock Exchange and chained {{themselves to}} the VIP balcony to protest <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the only approved AIDS drug, AZT. The group displayed a banner that read, “SELL WELLCOME” referring to the pharmaceutical sponsor of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome, which had set a price of approximately $10,000 per patient per year for the drug, well {{out of reach of}} nearly all HIV positive persons. Several days following this demonstration, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of AZT to $6,400 per patient per year.|$|E
25|$|When cotton {{was king}} during the 1850s, Mississippi {{plantation}} owners—especially {{those of the}} Delta and Black Belt central regions—became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> cotton on the international market, and their assets in slaves. They used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on {{hundreds of thousands of}} slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for secession.
