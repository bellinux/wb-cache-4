5000|$|An anti-sway or {{anti-roll}} bar {{is intended to}} force {{each side of the}} vehicle to lower, or rise, to similar heights, to reduce the sideways <b>tilting</b> (<b>roll)</b> of the vehicle on curves, sharp corners, or large bumps. With the bar removed, a vehicle's wheels can tilt away by much larger distances (as shown by the SUV image at right). Although there are many variations in design, a common function is to force the opposite wheel's shock absorber, spring or suspension rod to lower, or rise, to a similar level as the other wheel. In a fast turn, a vehicle tends to drop closer onto the outer wheels, and the sway bar soon forces the opposite wheel to also get closer to the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle tends to [...] "hug" [...] the road closer in a fast turn, where all wheels are closer to the body. After the fast turn, then the downward pressure is reduced, and the paired wheels can return to their normal height against the vehicle, kept at similar levels by the connecting sway bar.|$|E

The motion consisted of single cycles of sinusoidal acceleration at 0. 2 Hz for <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> and 1. 0 Hz for yaw rotation about an earth-vertical axis, inter-aural earth-horizontal translation (y-translation), inferior-superior earth-vertical translation (z-translation), and <b>roll</b> <b>tilt.</b> A large subset {{of this population}} (99 of 105) also performed a modified Romberg test of standing balance. Despite the relatively large population (54 F/ 51 M), we found no difference between thresholds {{of male and female}} subjects. After pooling across sex, we found that thresholds increased above the age of 40 for all five motion-directions investigated. The data were best modeled by a two-segment age model that yielded a constant baseline below an age cut-off of about 40 and a threshold increase above the age cut-off. For all subjects who passed all conditions of the balance test, the baseline thresholds were 0. 97 ˚/s for yaw rotation, 0. 66 ˚/s for 1 Hz <b>roll</b> <b>tilt,</b> 0. 35 ˚/s for 0. 2 Hz <b>roll</b> <b>tilt,</b> 0. 58 cm/s for y-translation, and 1. 24 cm/s for z-translation.

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the spatial coding of eye {{movements}} during static <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> (up to +/- 45 degrees) relative to perceived earth and head orientations. Binocular videographic recordings obtained in darkness from eight subjects allowed us to quantify the mean deviations in gaze trajectories along both horizontal and vertical coordinates relative to the true earth and head orientations. We found that both variability and curvature of gaze trajectories increased with <b>roll</b> <b>tilt.</b> The trajectories of eye movements made along the perceived earth-horizontal (PEH) were more accurate than movements along the perceived head-horizontal (PHH). The trajectories of both PEH and PHH saccades tended to deviate in the same direction as the head tilt. The deviations in gaze trajectories along the perceived earth-vertical (PEV) and perceived head-vertical (PHV) were both similar to the PHH orientation, except that saccades along the PEV deviated in the opposite direction relative to the head tilt. The magnitude of deviations along the PEV, PHH, and PHV corresponded to perceptual overestimations of <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> obtained from verbal reports. Both PEV gaze trajectories and perceptual estimates of tilt orientation were different following clockwise rather than counterclockwise tilt rotation; however, the PEH gaze trajectories were less affected by the direction of tilt rotation. Our results suggest that errors in gaze trajectories along PEV and perceived head orientations increase during <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> in a similar way to perceptual errors of tilt orientation. Although PEH and PEV gaze trajectories became nonorthogonal during <b>roll</b> <b>tilt,</b> we conclude that the spatial coding of eye movements during <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> is overall more accurate for the perceived earth reference frame than for the perceived head reference frame...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the close}} {{interrelation}} between vestibular and visual processing (e. g., vestibulo-ocular reflex), surprisingly {{little is known}} about vestibular function in visually impaired people. In this study, we investigated thresholds of passive whole-body motion discrimination (leftward vs. rightward) in nine visually impaired participants and nine age-matched sighted controls. Participants were rotated in yaw, <b>tilted</b> in <b>roll,</b> and translated along the interaural axis at two different frequencies (0. 33 and 2 Hz) by means of a motion platform. Superior performance of visually impaired participants was found in the 0. 33 Hz <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> condition. No differences were observed in the other motion conditions. <b>Roll</b> <b>tilts</b> stimulate the semicircular canals and otoliths simultaneously.

40|$|Summary: The DNA inter {{base pair}} step {{parameters}} (<b>Tilt,</b> <b>Roll,</b> Twist, Shift, Slide, Rise) are a standard internal coordinate representation of DNA. In {{the absence of}} bend and shear, it {{is relatively easy to}} mentally visualize how Twist and Rise generate the familiar double helix. More complex structures do not readily yield to such intuition. For this reason we developed a plug-in for VMD that accepts a set of mathematical expressions as input and generates a coarse-grained model of DNA as output. This feature of VDNA appears to provide a unique approach to DNA modeling. Predefined expressions include: linear, sheared, bent, and circular DNA and models of the nucleosome superhelix, chromatin, thermal motion, and nucleosome unwrapping. Availability: VDNA is pre...|$|R
40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an asymmetrical thickness profile (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were rolled to a camber shape with <b>tilted</b> <b>rolls.</b> A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by <b>tilting</b> the <b>rolls</b> in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor <b>tilting</b> of <b>rolls</b> and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly <b>tilted</b> <b>rolls.</b> In addition to straight initial specimens <b>rolled</b> with <b>tilted</b> <b>rolls,</b> specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight rolls. The significant camber formation as a result of the asymmetrical thickness profile may be prevented by <b>tilting</b> the <b>rolls</b> according to the initial thickness wedge. This roll adjustment, however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the <b>tilting</b> of <b>rolls</b> is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side guides on the strip form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the roughing train of the EKO-Stahl hot-rolling mill. This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|R
40|$|How {{does the}} brain {{calculate}} the spatial {{orientation of the}} head relative to gravity? Psychophysical measurements are critical to investigate this question, but such measurements have been limited to humans. In non-human primates, behavioral measures have focused on vestibular-mediated eye movements, which do not reflect percepts of head orientation. We have therefore developed a method to measure tilt perception in monkeys, derived from the subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. Two rhesus monkeys were trained to align a light bar parallel to gravity and performed this task during <b>roll</b> <b>tilts,</b> centrifugation, and <b>roll</b> optokinetic stimulation. The monkeys accurately aligned the light bar with gravity during static <b>roll</b> <b>tilts</b> but also demonstrated small orientation-dependent misperceptions of the tilt angle analogous to those measured in humans. When the gravito-inertial force (GIF) rotated dynamically in the roll plane, SVV responses remained closely aligned with the GIF during <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> of the head (coplanar canal rotational cues present), lagged slightly behind the GIF during variable-radius centrifugation (no canal cues present), and shifted gradually during fixed-radius centrifugation (orthogonal yaw canal cues present). SVV responses also deviated away from the earth-vertical during roll optokinetic stimulation. These results demonstrate that rotational cues derived from the semicircular canals and visual system have prominent effects on psychophysical measurements of <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> in rhesus monkeys and therefore suggest that a central synthesis of graviceptive and rotational cues contributes to percepts of head orientation relative to gravity in non-human primates...|$|R

Using a motion platform we investigated thresholds of passive whole-body motion discrimination in nine visually impaired participants and nine age-matched sighted controls. Participants were rotated in yaw, <b>tilted</b> in <b>roll,</b> and translated along the y-axis at two different frequencies (0. 3 Hz and 2 Hz).

No differences between the visually impaired and controls were observed in all other types of motion. The superior performance in the 0. 3 Hz <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> condition could reflect differences in the integration of extra-vestibular cues and increased sensitivity towards changes {{in the direction of the}} gravito-inertial force. In the absence of visual information, <b>roll</b> <b>tilts</b> entail a more pronounced risk of falling, and this could eventually account for the group difference.

METHODS: OVEMPs and the visual vertical were measured in 11 patients and 11 healthy subjects. Visual vertical was measured during <b>roll</b> <b>tilts</b> between - 9. 6 degrees and 9. 6 degrees, and during rotation at 400 degrees /s with the head upright and the vertical rotation axis located between +/- 3. 5 cm from the head center. RESULTS: OVEMPs in patients were strikingly asymmetric, whereas they were approximately symmetric in healthy subjects. Patients showed impaired visual vertical gain during eccentric rotation and increased errors for both <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> and eccentric rotation tests. OVEMPs were superior at discriminating between patients and healthy subjects, although eccentric rotation performed nearly as well. CONCLUSIONS: OVEMPs provide a powerful test for discriminating between healthy subjects and patients with chronic unilateral vestibular loss, and testing the visual vertical testing during eccentric rotation was superior to testing during whole-body <b>roll</b> <b>tilt.</b> SIGNIFICANCE: OVEMPs are easier to administer, less demanding on patients, and in general are more effective at identifying chronic unilateral vestibular loss than visual vertical measurements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOcular counter-rolling (OCR) {{induced by}} whole body <b>tilt</b> in <b>roll</b> has been {{explored}} after spaceflight {{as an indicator}} of the adaptation of the otolith function to microgravity. It has been claimed that the overall pattern of OCR responses during static body tilt after spaceflight is indicative of a decreased role of the otolith function, but the results of these studies have not been consistent, mostly due to large variations in the OCR within and across individuals. By contrast with static head tilt, off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) presents the advantage of generating a sinusoidal modulation of OCR, allowing averaged measurements over several cycles, thus improving measurement accuracy. Accordingly, OCR and the sense of <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> were evaluated in seven astronauts before and after spaceflight during OVAR at 45 degrees/s in darkness at two angles of tilt (10 degrees and 20 degrees). There {{was no significant difference in}} OCR during OVAR immediately after landing compared to preflight. However, the amplitude of the perceived <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> during OVAR was significantly larger immediately postflight, and then returned to control values in the following days. Since the OCR response is predominantly attributed to the shearing force exerted on the utricular macula, the absence of change in OCR postflight suggests that the peripheral otolith organs function normally after short-term spaceflight. However, the increased sense of <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> indicates an adaptation in the central processing of gravitational input, presumably related to a re-weighting of the internal representation of gravitational vertical as a result of adaptation to microgravity...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} published vestibular perceptual thresholds {{and performance in}} the Modified Romberg Test of Standing Balance in 105 healthy humans ranging from ages 18 to 80 (1). Self-motion thresholds in the dark included <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> about an earth-horizontal axis at 0. 2 and 1 [*]Hz, yaw rotation about an earth-vertical axis at 1 [*]Hz, y-translation (interaural/lateral) at 1 [*]Hz, and z-translation (vertical) at 1 [*]Hz. In this study, we focus on multiple variable analyses not reported in the earlier study. Specifically, we investigate correlations (1) among the five thresholds measured and (2) between thresholds, age, and the chance of failing condition 4 of the balance test, which increases vestibular reliance by having subjects stand on foam with eyes closed. We found moderate correlations (0. 30 – 0. 51) between vestibular thresholds for different motions, {{both before and after}} using our published aging regression to remove age effects. We found that lower or higher thresholds across all threshold measures are an individual trait that account for about 60 % of the variation in the population. This can be further distributed into two components with about 20 % of the variation explained by aging and 40 % of variation explained by a single principal component that includes similar contributions from all threshold measures. When only <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> 0. 2 [*]Hz thresholds and age were analyzed together, we found that the chance of failing condition 4 depends significantly on both (p[*]=[*] 0. 006 and p[*]=[*] 0. 013, respectively). An analysis incorporating more variables found that the chance of failing condition 4 depended significantly only on <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> 0. 2 [*]Hz thresholds (p[*]=[*] 0. 046) and not age (p[*]=[*] 0. 10), sex nor any of the other four threshold measures, suggesting that some of the age effect might be captured by the fact that vestibular thresholds increase with age.

Static tilt (from 0 to 57 deg. to either side) showed a 10 % decrease in otolith induced ocular torsion after centrifugation. This implies a reduced gain of the otolith function. The dynamic condition consisted of sinusoidal body roll (frequency 0. 25 Hz, amplitude 45 deg.) about an earth horizontal and about an earth vertical axis (respectively, "with" and "without" otolith stimulation). Before centrifugation the gain of the slow component velocity (SCV) was significantly lower "with" otolith stimulation than "without" otolith stimulation.

To compare these mathematical expressions to experimental data we develop a strategy for Fourier-filtering the helical parameters that identifies necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve a high-resolution model of the nucleosome superhelix. We apply this filtering strategy to 24 high-resolution structures of the nucleosome and demonstrate that all structures have a highly conserved distribution of Roll, Slide and Twist that involves two length scales. One length scale spans the entire length of nucleosomal DNA. The other is associated with the helix repeat. Our strategy also enables us to identify ground state or simple nucleosomes and altered nucleosome structures. These results form a basis for characterizing structural variations in the emerging family of nucleosome structures and a method for further developing structure-based models of nucleosome stability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} head <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> on the binocular coordination of ocular counterroll in non-human primates, we measured binocular ocular counterroll in two rhesus monkeys fixating a straight ahead target, while adopting different head <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> positions. We used two infrared cameras to take snapshots of {{the left and the}} right eye in order to measure the resulting ocular counterroll responses. The horizontal and vertical components of the position of one of the two eyes where measured using an implanted 2 D-search coil in one monkey and video-based eye tracking in the second one. We consistently observed disconjugate ocular counterroll responses to static head roll in both monkeys. Invariably, the eye positioned further away from ground level by <b>roll</b> <b>tilting</b> the head always exhibited larger ocular counterroll than the other eye. The pattern of disconjugacy of the ocular counterroll responses exhibited by rhesus monkey parallels the one described for humans. The correspondence between the two species suggests that monkeys may serve as useful models in studies of the neuronal underpinnings of tilt-induced ocular counterroll and the perceptual compensation of uncompensated retinal image tilt...|$|R
40|$|Healthy human subjects, when <b>roll</b> <b>tilted</b> in darkness, make {{systematic}} {{errors in}} estimating subjective visual vertical (SVV). Typically, <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> underestimation occurs at angles beyond 60 degrees (A-effect). At smaller tilt angles, overestimation may occur (E-effect). At approximately 135 degrees whole-body <b>roll</b> <b>tilt,</b> Kaptein and Van Gisbergen (2004, 2005) found an abrupt A/E transition, {{the exact location}} of which depended on the preceding rotation direction indicating hysteresis. Since this was observed using relatively fast roll velocity, it remains unclear whether the described hysteresis is dynamic or static. To clarify this uncertainty, we continuously rotated nine healthy subjects about the earth-horizontal naso-occipital axis, while they performed SVV adjustments every 2 s. Starting from the upright position, three full quasi-static constant velocity rotations (2 degrees/s) were completed in both directions (CW: clockwise; CCW: counterclockwise). SVV deviation from earth-verticality was plotted as a function of whole-body roll position. A bimodal Gaussian distribution function was fitted to SVV differences between CW and CCW rotations. A-effects (peaks at 88 degrees and 257 degrees chair position) at identical whole-body positions were larger after rotations from upside-down than after rotations from upright (average peak difference: 26 degrees). These results demonstrate static hysteresis for SVV estimation...|$|R
30|$|Jelali [113] {{introduced}} the monitoring technology to shape {{closed-loop control system}} of the cold rolling strip. The insufficiency of control system was observed and the adaptive improvement was realized through the online batch evaluation and shock diagnosis. Benporad, et al. [114], proposed three different control strategies based on quadratic optimization and hysteresis compensation techniques and significantly improved the performance of control system. Pin, et al. [115, 116], decomposed the shape signal into several orthogonal components corresponding to different shape control means, and the adjustment amount of control means was obtained by constrained optimization. The control precision was then improved by online adaptive technology. A control model of asymmetrical shape was established by evaluating the influence of <b>roll</b> <b>tilting,</b> work <b>roll</b> and intermediate roll asymmetrical bending on the asymmetrical shape through simulation calculation [117]. Furthermore, a reduced dimension control model and two times control strategies were proposed based on Legendre orthogonal polynomials {{and the concept of}} shape efficiency coefficient to improve the control performance [118].|$|R

We found that subjects ⩾ 31 years had lower gains than those ⩽ 30 years, but only for far targets. Consistent with prior reports, far targets elicited higher OCR gains than near targets, and target complexity {{had no effect on}} gains, suggesting that visual input is primarily used to maintain vergence during OCR...|$|R
40|$|Skew quadrupoles {{are well}} known for their {{capability}} of tilting beams around their longitudinal axes. However, dipoles can produce the same effect. A horizontal bending dipole aligned with an inclination (slope) angle phi {{with respect to the}} reference coordinate system introduces a small <b>tilt</b> (<b>roll)</b> angle psi into the beam, which for small angles is proportional to the product of the magnet bending angle alpha and the slope phi. For transfer lines this effect has previously been neglected (it is comparable to the tilt alignment tolerance of the magnets of the order of 0. 1 mrad rms), but for long lines with many horizontal bending magnets on relatively steep vertical slopes relative to the reference frame, a non-negligible tilt angle psi can accumulate between the local beam plane and the reference alignment system. This can result in mismatch at injection with subsequent emittance blow-up, and other undesirable effects, such as non-orthogonal trajectory measurement and correction. A detailed description of this effect is given, illustrated by the SPS to LHC transfer lines TI 8 and the LHC machine itself. The implications and the resulting choice of methodology for alignment of the elements along the line are described and a solution for matching to the plane of the LHC is outlined...|$|R
40|$|In decerebrate cats, a 3 -h {{period of}} {{sustained}} <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> {{of the head}} (at 0. 15 Hz. +/- 10) leading to selective stimulation of labyrinth receptors, associated with a synchronous <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> of the body (at 0. 15 Hz., +/- 12. 5) leading to 2. 5 degrees out-of-phase neck rotation produced an adaptive increase in gain of the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) elicited by <b>roll</b> <b>tilt</b> of the animal at 0. 15 Hz, +/- 10 degrees. This increase reached the maximum {{at the end of}} the third h of stimulation and persisted unmodified during the first h after stimulation. Microinjection into zone B of the cerebellar anterior vermis of the GABA-A agonist muscimol (0. 25 microliter at 8 micrograms/microliters saline), producing only a slight or negligible depression of the VRS gain in non-adaptive conditions, prevented the occurrence of the adapted increase in gain of the VSR following a 3 -h period of sustained head-body rotation. Moreover, intravermal injection of the GABA-A agonist muscimol or the GABA-B agonist baclofen (0. 25 microliter at 8 or 2 micrograms/microliters saline, respectively) suppressed the already adapted VSR gain. It is postulated that the adaptive increase in gain of the VSR following a sustained neck-vestibular stimulation depends on plastic changes which affect the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar anterior vermis...|$|R
