Front-end styling changed appreciably with a [...] "waterfall" [...] grille {{with a fine}} chrome vertical bar treatment, quad rectangular headlights atop slim, wide clear parking and signal lights, and lighter aluminum bumpers were new for 1979. The D/L sedan was given a new vinyl roof design which extended only over the rear passenger compartment was complemented by chrome trim that overlaid the B-pillar and wrapped over the vinyl roof at its leading edge. A thin <b>trim</b> <b>piece</b> at the roof's edge simulated a convertible's fold-down hinge point. The D/L package, now the middle trim level, was extended to the hatchback, which was given a brushed aluminum Targa-like roof band and a half-vinyl roof to differentiate it from the base model hatchback.|$|E

Externally PA-2s could be distinguished {{by the absence of}} the [...] "eyebrow" [...] <b>trim</b> <b>piece</b> on the grille behind the cab and the porthole window behind the radiator shutters. Internally, later PA-2 and PB-2 production featured a water-cooled turbocharger and other engine compartment changes, but these were frequently added to older models undergoing major repairs or overhauls. Four PA-1s were upgraded by Morrison-Knudsen in 1974-75 for passenger service on the Delaware & Hudson and became the PA4.

The wraparound rear {{window on the}} sedans was modified to a flat unit, with a more squared-off [...] "C" [...] pillar, which changed the appearance from the earlier sedans with their overhanging rooflines. [...] The overall effect was a more formal-looking car. [...] The 440 and Rogue versions picked up a stainless steel <b>trim</b> <b>piece</b> running stem to stern on either body side, straight back between the wheel wells and the belt line. At {{each end of the}} strip were the newly safety-mandated body side reflectors, amber for the front fenders, red for the rear. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards for all passenger cars sold in America for 1968 also called for shoulder harness for the front seats and elimination of reflective interior trim. Other requirements for all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, included exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E

For the RX 300, a 240-watt, 7-speaker Pioneer sound system was standard, while a premium Nakamichi customized sound system was available as an option. Interior features further included Walnut wood trim and an optional in-dash six-CD changer. The overall RX 300 concept, which directed SUV qualities to an on-road vehicle, was based on market research which found that merely 7 percent of SUV owners drove off-road. The RX 300 interior featured leather trim, two rows of seating, and a rear cargo area which could be concealed beneath a tonneau cover. The center dashboard was dominated by a central liquid crystal display (LCD) multi-information screen for audio, climate, and performance data, along with a U-shaped wood <b>trim</b> <b>piece</b> {{and a pair of}} air conditioning vents. The gear shift was mounted {{at the base of the}} center console, thus leaving open space below for additional storage space, legroom, or movement to the passenger-side seat.
