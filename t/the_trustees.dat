5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trustees</b> of the Baltimore City College Scholarship Funds, Inc., was {{established}} and incorporated in 1983, and replaced a similar entity that {{was established}} in 1924. <b>The</b> <b>Trustees</b> manage endowments, most of which provide annual scholarships to graduating seniors based on criteria stipulated by the donors. Combined endowment assets are currently valued at or around $1.68 million (adjusted for inflation) covering thirty-four annual scholarships.

5|$|According to the statutes, the Foundation {{consists}} of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm.

As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee), <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> of these institutions, and auditors.|$|E
50|$|The {{beneficiary}} of a charitable trust was on welfare.

However, since <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> had absolute discretion, <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> could choose {{not to make a}} distribution to the beneficiary. (Note: Recent legislation makes it easier for the government to compel <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> to make a distribution).|$|R

50|$|Trust {{creditors}} (that is, {{persons who}} have become creditors of <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> qua trustee) may be entitled to be subrogated to <b>the</b> <b>trustee's</b> lien. This is a particularly precarious 'right' of trust creditors: a trustee {{may not have a}} right of indemnity (for example, because <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> has committed a breach of trust in incurring the liability to the creditor in question) or it may be limited (for example, where <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> has committed an unrelated breach of trust and the clear accounts rule operates). In some jurisdictions it is possible for <b>the</b> <b>trustee's</b> right of indemnity to be excluded altogether. In these cases, subrogation may be rendered worthless or impossible.|$|R
5|$|By this time, Hogan {{had begun}} to lose the trustees' support. At some point soon thereafter, he left the city. In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell {{partially}} capitulated to <b>the</b> <b>trustees,</b> yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments. In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.|$|E
5|$|Egan's own {{research}} into the issue showed that <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> had conveyed St. Mary's Church to the previous pastor, Robert Harding, and then to his heirs, but <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> did not consider that property transfer to have extinguished {{their role in the}} church's leadership. By 1811, Egan's worsening health caused him to accept the assistance of two priests at St. Mary's, James Harold and his nephew, William Vincent Harold. Egan and <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> became further embroiled in a dispute about clerical salaries, a situation possibly made worse by the decline in shipping income in the port city caused by the outbreak of the War of 1812. Egan also came to believe the Harolds were making the situation worse by taking pro-clergy positions that were more extreme than Egan's own and by the younger Harold's scheming to be named Egan's coadjutor bishop. He appealed to <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> for compromise, and offered to bring his cousin (also a priest) over from Ireland to replace the elder Harold. By 1813, Egan and <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> had reconciled and together resolved to remove the Harolds, who agreed to resign later that year and relocate to England.|$|E
5|$|F. During the series, it was {{revealed}} that the Victoria club had not filed a formal challenge.

30|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the expected behavior of <b>trustee</b> is beyond <b>the</b> trustor’s control; the trustor’s belief in that expected behavior of trustee is based on <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> capability, goodwill (including intension or motivation), and integrity.

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, <b>the</b> <b>trustees</b> of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against <b>the</b> <b>trustees.</b> Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

5|$|Below Frodsham, barges {{carrying}} salt had {{to negotiate}} a tidal section of the river to reach the Mersey, from where the cargo would be taken to Liverpool or Manchester for distribution worldwide. Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides, resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham. In 1796, users of the navigation suggested {{that it should be}} extended to Weston Point, where the water was deeper. <b>The</b> <b>trustees</b> wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls, but the users objected, and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Trustees</b> obtained a third Act on 8 August 1807, which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point. <b>The</b> <b>trustees</b> insisted that their own engineer, John Johnson, should oversee the work, but the project was too large for him, and ran over time and budget. He was sacked in 1809, after serving the navigation for 29 years, and Thomas Telford was asked to complete the work. He managed the project with Samuel Fowls as engineer. At Weston Point, a new lock connected the cut to a basin, and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey. This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810. A fourth Act was obtained on 2 May 1825, which altered some of the details of the previous Act, and an Act of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed. It stated that <b>the</b> <b>Trustees</b> had built a basin, piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point, that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver, and that <b>the</b> <b>Trustees</b> would make no additional charges for using the section. No tolls had been collected since 1816, once the construction costs had been repaid.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{discusses}} {{the application of}} sections 45 and 46 of the Quebec Labour Code {{in the context of}} the trust deed, at each step of the realization by <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> of its securitees, namely : the taking of possession of the mortgaged assets and the carrying on of the operations of the debtor company by <b>the</b> <b>trustee,</b> as well as the acquisition or the taking charge of the mortgaged assets by a third party from <b>the</b> <b>trustee.</b> <b>The</b> author's argument or reasoning is based upon the unity of the two prerequisites for the application of section 45, i. e. a change of employer and the alienation or operation by another of the undertaking. On the basis of this reasoning, section 45 applies to <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> who takes possession only when he deliberately carries on the undertaking of the debtor company, whether it be in whole or in part, or even for a limited time, because only then should <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> be considered a new employer. The application of section 45 to a third party dealing with <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> is also certain when such third party carries on the undertaking that <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> had himself carried on. But the situation is not as certain when <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> has not himself carried on the undertaking after taking possession, and the author explains the reasons for his doubts. Finally, in view of the current state of the law and jurisprudence, the author suggests alternate ways for <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> to deal with a third party in order to avoid the application of section 45...|$|R

30|$|Benevolence or malevolence {{is one of}} the key {{dimensions}} of trust or distrust. Benevolence is concerned with commitment and intentions of <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> good will; therefore, the trustor’s emotional assessment of <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> positive behavior takes place (Dimoka 2010). Benevolence is different from credibility, which is believed to be associated with cognitive assessment of contracts, laws, and structural assurances (Williamson 1985). On the opposite note, malevolence is associated with the trustor’s emotional assessment of <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> negative and/or harmful behavior. Malevolence is different from discredibility, which deals with the trustor’s cognitive assessment of the potential loss through <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> incompetence and unreliability.|$|R
