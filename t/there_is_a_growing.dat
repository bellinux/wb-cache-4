5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
