5|$|<b>The</b> <b>novel</b> <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> a {{narration}} by its protagonist, Cal (his masculine identity), {{also known}} as Calliope (feminine): He recounts how 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a recessive condition, caused him to be born with female characteristics.

These accounts cover the conception of Cal, his teenage years, and the discovery of his intersex condition. Throughout the book, Cal weaves his opinion of the events in hindsight and of his life after his father's funeral.

Afterwards, the narrator, referred to only as [...] "saya", describes {{in the first person}} how he met Hasan and how the main character came to tell him his life's story. This is followed by what is described by the original narrator as a manuscript by Hasan, which tells Hasan's life story from his own point of view using the less respectful term [...] "aku". After a brief recollection of the narrator's last meeting with Hasan in the first person, using [...] "saya", the last portion of the book describes Hasan's death in the third person omniscient. According to Teeuw, this serves to avoid caricaturing the characters by giving an objective presentation of them before transitioning to their point of view. However, Mihardja wrote that it was simply to facilitate the completion of the plot.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} tell the story of the {{conversion}} of the Conte del Sagrato in Fermo e Lucia, Manzoni adheres to the Pauline model of a sudden shock, thus interpreting the event as a miraculous event in which the redeemed sinner’s role remains completely passive. In The Betrothed, however, the whole episode is being rewritten from the Augustinian model of the Confessions, which represents conversion as a slow and gradual process of crisis, full of anxiety, inner conflict, dejection and resistance, in which God calls for repentance, creates favourable opportunities, eliminates inner anguish and offers necessary help, while respecting human timing, nature and freedom. This essay reconstructs, step by step, all the stages of the conversion of the Unnamed, from his first appearance in <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> to his exit, highlighting the psychological as well as moral turning points of the process of conversion, not without repeated references to the other converts in <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> Fra Cristoforo, and Napoleon in the Fifth of May...|$|R

5000|$|In {{fact the}} [...] "Martian" [...] {{of the title}} {{is none other than}} an entity that {{undergoes}} successive reincarnations ad infinitum.

It is implied that Barty's and his wife Leah's moral, intellectual and physical perfection will be passed on to evolve into even more perfect children to build a more perfect race of beings in the future And to whom but Barty Josselin do we owe it that our race is on an average already from four to six inches taller than it was thirty years ago, men and women alike; that strength and beauty are rapidly becoming the rule among us, and weakness and ugliness the exception?

40|$|Pozzoromolo is <b>the</b> second <b>novel</b> by <b>the</b> {{promising}} young writer Luigi Romolo Carrino. <b>The</b> <b>novel,</b> {{which has been}} shortlisted for the Premio Strega, is analyzed in this essay by applying linguistic-symbolical parameters. It is shown that these, already in the ambivalence of the protagonist, underline how language, characters, style, and narrative underlie <b>the</b> <b>novel’s</b> structure. <b>Starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> title {{and the name of}} the first-person narrator, <b>the</b> <b>novel’s</b> most important themes are analyzed. From the function of parental figures and a series of obvious intertextual echoes, one cannot but conclude that the main character’s split personality, distorted by the nature of the writing, also finds expression in <b>the</b> <b>novel’s</b> idiolectal solutions. It is in these that one can perceive the writer’s stylistic acrobatics, the consistent fragmentation of the diaristic narrative, and the interesting linguistic blend, which is made up of irregular sentences, intertextual echoes of literary and popular sources, original formal results and lyrical representations...|$|R

5000|$|The Cartoon Network's miniseries Over the Garden Wall {{took a lot}} of {{inspiration}} from <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> as each <b>started</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> protagonist (Dante/Wirt and Greg) lost in a dark place (a jungle/the unknown). In both works, there is a central female character named Beatrice. Greg acts as an allegory to Vergil. The three characters fight a dark shadow character known as [...] "The Beast", who is very clearly an allegory for The Devil. Wirt (the character who most resembles Dante) frequently waxes poetic, particularly in reference to his [...] "lost love" [...] from the mortal realm, similar to Dante.|$|R
