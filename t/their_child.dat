40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{any difference between}} the attributions parents made about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem, in {{parents of children with}} an Autism Spectrum Disorder and parents of children with Down Syndrome. Seventy-six parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and fifty-two parents of children with Down Syndrome completed a series of questionnaires on-line, regarding <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem, <b>their</b> beliefs about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and the parent’s level of anxiety and depression. A significant difference was found between the groups on four of the causal items; other health problem, child’s emotional state, child’s personality and diet. Parents of children with Down Syndrome showed a higher level of agreement that <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem could be attributed to another health problem compared to parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Parents of children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder showed a higher level of agreement that <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem could be attributed to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> personality, <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> emotional state and <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> diet compared to parents of children with DS. There was a high level of agreement across all parents that <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> disability was a causal factor to their sleep problem and differences in attributions may reflect characteristics of the child’s diagnosis. The results are consistent with previous findings that parents view disability as an important causal factor to <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and suggest a possible overlap in parent’s views of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> sleep problem and views of their disability...|$|R

However, until this thesis, {{there has been little}} research conducted in rural China on the impact of parental involvement on <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s education. In this thesis. I use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the nature of parental involvement in primary children 2 ̆ 7 s schooling in rural China. My study adds to the growing body of research that suggests that people in different cultures are involved in <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s schooling in different ways. I found that parents in rural China desired educational success for <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> They regarded education as a means to <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s gaining social mobility. However, few rural parents engaged in visible forms of parental involvement in <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s schools, such as attending parent-teacher meetings. Rural parents in my sample were caring, supportive, and had invisible ways of supporting <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s education. Their level of commitment to <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s schooling could be seen in the sacrifices they made, such as working at additional jobs or taking on additional household work so that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> could be free of household chores. Many rural parents sacrificed their free time in order to support <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s schooling. They also purchased schooling materials for <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> so that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> could enjoy a more positive schooling environment.

40|$|The {{involvement}} {{of parents in}} the education of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> is getting the attention of researchers and policy makers. Parents are considered to be the first teachers of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and have ample knowledge of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s strength and weakness. They {{can make a difference in}} <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s lives. Many studies have been done on parental involvement {{in the education of}} <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> yet very few studies have been conducted on how unschooled parents contribute towards the education of <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> This study, based on qualitative case study research, explores the ways unschooled parents, particularly from low socioeconomic backgrounds contribute to the education of their children; the impact of their support on <b>their</b> <b>children</b> learning outcomes; and the challenges they face in supporting their education. The study was conducted in a secondary school in Karachi, Pakistan. The sample comprised five parents, <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in class two to eight, concerned class teachers and the head teacher of the school. The data were collected through interviews, observations, and document analysis. The analysis of the qualitative data revealed that unschooled parents support <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in several ways. They provide financial, emotional, and moral support. They also monitor <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s activities. The Parents have high aspirations for <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> they wish a better future for <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> For this they sacrifice their own desires for <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s education. They work hard to fulfill <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s educational needs. Contrary to general expectations, their support encourages <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to perform well in school. They are position holders in their classes. With their parents 2 ̆ 7 support and interest, these children also seem to be motivated to work harder, which in turn leads to positive outcomes. The Parents face many challenges in supporting <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> like financial problems, them not being educated themselves, and the school demands. This study challenges the general perception and belief that only educated and well off parents are able to contribute to the education of <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> This study has implications for public and private sector schools in Pakistan, where majority of parents are unschooled and underprivileged. Unschooled parents are often quite committed to <b>their</b> <b>children</b> 2 ̆ 7 s education and work very hard to support them. If schools are able to capitalize this bank of parental goodwill and enthusiasm, they, together with parents, can provide quality education to the children. The School leaders and policy makers can bring parental voices in the school in formulation of their strategy for school improvement, welcome and celebrate the efforts of unschooled parents towards the attainment of education goals of <b>their</b> <b>children.</b> This synergy between parents and schools can provide an enabling environment to all the children in schools...|$|R
