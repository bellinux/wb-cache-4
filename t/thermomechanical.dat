25|$|Similar to <b>thermomechanical</b> exergy, {{chemical}} exergy {{depends on}} the temperature and pressure of a system {{as well as on}} the composition. The key difference in evaluating chemical exergy versus <b>thermomechanical</b> exergy is that <b>thermomechanical</b> exergy does not take into account the difference in a system and environment's chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment's state, then the overall system will have exergy.|$|E
25|$|The {{substrates}} {{are characterized}} by several key parameters, chiefly <b>thermomechanical</b> (glass transition temperature, tensile strength, shear strength, thermal expansion), electrical (dielectric constant, loss tangent, dielectric breakdown voltage, leakage current, tracking resistance...), and others (e.g. moisture absorption).|$|E
25|$|The plant {{features}} {{two sources}} of pulp – a <b>thermomechanical</b> pulp mill and a deinkling mill. These feed three paper machines, all which produce newsprint. Operations {{run around the}} clock, where the process and supervisory workers work in five shifts.|$|E
25|$|Only in 1997, {{starting}} with Ireland, did the Commonwealth countries and then other countries begin to legally grow industrial hemp again. Iterations of the 1930s decorticator {{have been met}} with limited success, along with steam explosion and chemical processing known as <b>thermomechanical</b> pulping.|$|E
25|$|Physical Trap: {{depressions}} in the footwall rocks, {{which may}} represent volcanic topographic irregularities modified by <b>thermomechanical</b> erosion.

25|$|After {{finding the}} {{chemical}} exergy {{in a given}} system, one can find the total exergy by adding it to the <b>thermomechanical</b> exergy. Depending on the situation, the amount of chemical exergy added can be very small. If the system being evaluated involves combustion, the amount of chemical exergy is very large and necessary to find the total exergy of the system.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS is a {{pulp mill}} and paper mill located in Halden, Norway, which {{produces}} supercalender (SC) magazine paper. Located {{in the river}} Tista in Tistedalen, the mill produces 550,000 tonnes per year in three paper machines. Pulp is produced both from virgin fibers at an on-site <b>thermomechanical</b> pulp (TMP) mill. Part of Norske Skog, it is the sole remaining magazine mill in Norway.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} was {{introduction}} of a new pulp process, <b>thermomechanical</b> pulp (TMP), replacing the former grindstone mechanical pulping. TMP allowed for more long fibers to be retained, thus improving the strength. This allowed for cellulose content to be dropped from fifteen percent, which would allow for cost-savings along with faster processing through the paper machines. The first TMP machine was installed in 1977, with a daily capacity of 120 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Norske Skog Skogn AS is a {{pulp mill}} and paper mill {{situated}} in Levanger, Norway, which produces newsprint. Situated on the Fiborgtangen peninsula in Skogn, the mill has three paper machines {{with a total}} annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes. Pulp is produced both from virgin fibers at an on-site <b>thermomechanical</b> pulp (TMP) mill and from recycled paper at a deinking (DIP) mill. Part of Norske Skog, it is the sole remaining newsprint mill in Norway.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan has}} two value chains to produce pulp. The first is <b>thermomechanical</b> process, which is fed {{chippings}} directly from external sources, {{as well as}} on-side chopping of lumber. The bark from the lumber is extracted and used in as on-site heating. The second source of pulp is from recycled paper, sourced both domestically and through import. The recycled paper goes through a deinking process before becoming usable deinkled pulp (DIP). A small portion of calcium carbonate {{is added to the}} pulp before processing.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of chemical exergy resembles the standard {{definition of}} <b>thermomechanical</b> exergy, {{but with a}} few differences. Chemical exergy {{is defined as the}} maximum work that can be obtained when the considered system is brought into reaction with reference substances present in the environment. Defining the exergy reference environment {{is one of the most}} vital parts of analyzing chemical exergy. In general, the environment is defined as the composition of air at 25°C and 1 atm of pressure. At these properties air consists of N2=75.67%, O2=20.35%, H2O(g)=3.12%, CO2=0.03% and other gases=0.83%. These molar fractions will become of use when applying Equation 8 below.|$|E
25|$|The term mainly {{refers to}} a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of {{materials}} with interesting <b>thermomechanical</b> properties. The most commercially important of these have {{the distinction of being}} impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking. The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000°C.|$|E
2500|$|The rinser, {{chipping}} module and the <b>thermomechanical</b> {{pulp mill}} opened in January 1992. Installation {{of the paper}} machine started in July; at the most 1,150 people worked on the project as a whole. Built by Valmet, PM6 started operating on 7 February 1993. By 1995 PM6 set a word record of [...] per minute and the mill as a whole produced 523,000 tonnes and had a profit of NOK700 million. Saugbrugsforeningen merged with Norske Skog from 1 January 1996, becoming a business unit named Norske Skog Saugbrugs.|$|E
