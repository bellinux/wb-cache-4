25|$|Many fans of Breaking Bad, {{including}} actor Norm Macdonald and New York writer Emily Nussbaum, {{proposed a}} theory, {{in which most}} of the series finale happened in Walt's mind, and he really died in the stolen Volvo in the beginning of it. While Nussbaum merely stated that it would be her preferred ending, Macdonald emphasized the seemingly unreal scenarios of Walt's final day, as well as what he deemed unreliable acting. However, series creator Vince Gilligan debunked this theory, explaining that Walt could not possibly have known several <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> like Jesse being held in captivity by Jack's gang instead of being murdered by them, or that Todd had begun taking meetings with Lydia regarding the meth trade.|$|E

500|$|According to Emma Barrow of The Daily Telegraph, {{the match}} {{is said to}} have instigated the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United, which {{continued}} through the 1990s and 2000s.

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{feature for}} [...] "Oathbreaker", showrunner Weiss stated of the Tower of Joy {{flashback}} that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about being able to go back with Bran and look at the past {{is to be able to}} see the discrepancy between the received history, the things that everybody knows about the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened,</b> and what actually happened."

[...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
500|$|Commentators mainly praised Hutton's {{concentration}} and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly {{when compared to}} Bradman's innings of 334, was excused {{on the grounds that}} the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, Les Ames believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain Bob Wyatt described the innings as one of the greatest feats of {{concentration and}} endurance in the history of the game. Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, [...] in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.|$|E
500|$|Before embarking her solo career, Roberts was one {{fifth of}} British girl band Girls Aloud. Roberts claimed {{that she found}} the {{experience}} of going solo troubling. She revealed that she struggled to cope with life {{in the public eye}} and the constant media attention. In particular, she received negative attention concerning her image. The experience led her to start to develop her debut album, which, lyrically, reflected the difficult times she experienced in Girls Aloud. On [...] "Beat of My Drum", Roberts describes herself as a [...] "baby in the corner" [...] - the song's original title. Roberts helped to write all of the tracks on Cinderella's Eyes, with the lyrics telling stories of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> in her life. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was co-written with Maya von Doll, Diplo and Dimitri Tikovoi. She stated that she had always wanted [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] to be something different from the music that other pop singers were presenting in the charts. Roberts stated that [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] is [...] "a song everyone can sing and dance to". Roberts stated that she felt the song had a [...] "fun concept" [...] with a British influence.|$|E

[...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
500|$|... "Nebraska" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. Alex Strachan of the Ottawa Citizen {{felt that the}} episode was very poignant, adding that various scenes were [...] "beautifully acted". In his A– review, Verne Gay of Newsday opined that [...] "Nebraska" [...] accurately established the progression of a dark atmosphere {{for the second half}} of the season. Rawlings asserted that the episode gives the audience [...] "plenty to chew on", and that it nicely sets up a foundation for future storylines. The A.V. Club Zack Halden evoked similar sentiments; [...] "'Nebraska' doesn’t entirely rectify this concern, but it’s a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman commended the installment's sense of direction; [...] "I liked how this episode thrust us right back into it, and the understandable misery everyone was going through. [...] It was a mixture of chaos, sadness and zombie killing—a mixture this show can do very well." [...] Concluding his review, Goldman issued [...] "Nebraska" [...] an eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. The Atlantic Scott Meslow iterated: [...] "'Nebraska' largely spends its first two acts reiterating <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> earlier in the season, which in this case can somewhat be forgiven [...] But just when it looks as though the series will devote another episode to wheel-spinning, [...] "Nebraska" [...] surprises with a final act that serves as a reminder of why it's too soon to give up on The Walking Dead." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy noted that it successfully addressed the concerns of fans about the episodic pace, while also raising expectations for succeeding installments. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about the episode as the general consensus. Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard affirmed that [...] "Nebraska" [...] was inferior to its predecessor, ultimately giving it a C+ grade. Starlee Kine of New York wrote that it was [...] "just one huge whirlpool of pointless drama, pulling everything in its path under with it", while Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich thought that it was a setback from the previous episode.|$|E
