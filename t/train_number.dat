50|$|<b>Numbering</b> of the <b>trains</b> is {{determined}} by the type of the train. Regular trains (and also Proastiakos suburban/commuter rail service trains) have four-digit <b>train</b> <b>numbers,</b> Express <b>trains</b> have three-digit <b>train</b> <b>numbers</b> and Intercity (IC) and Intercity trains have two-digit <b>train</b> <b>numbers,</b> preceded by the symbols IC.|$|R
50|$|The train when {{introduced}} {{used to run}} between Katihar Jn to Delhi as <b>train</b> <b>number(s)</b> 983/984. This <b>train</b> {{was later}} extended to New Jalpaiguri with <b>train</b> <b>number(s)</b> 4083/4084. Finally the train was extended to Alipurduar Junction.|$|R
50|$|Train {{operators}} usually name {{long distance}} trains (Kintetsu {{is a rare}} exception of this practice). The process of ticket reservation utilizes the train names instead of the <b>train</b> <b>numbers.</b> <b>Train</b> <b>numbers</b> are almost exclusively for professional use.|$|R
25|$|Atocha Station (<b>train</b> <b>number</b> 21431) – Three bombs exploded. Based on {{the video}} {{recording}} from the station security system, the first bomb exploded at 07:37, and two others exploded within 4seconds of each other at 07:38.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other railroads whose {{locomotive}} number boards {{bore the}} locomotive number, SP used {{them for the}} <b>train</b> <b>number</b> until 1967. (SP's San Francisco-San Jose commute trains continued displaying train numbers {{for the convenience of}} passengers.) The other railroad that used locomotive number boards for train numbers into the 1960s was SP's transcontinental partner, Union Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The first bomb {{exploded}} on a six-car London Underground C69 and C77 Stock Circle line sub-surface <b>train,</b> <b>number</b> 204, travelling eastbound between Liverpool Street and Aldgate. The train had left King's Cross St Pancras about eight minutes earlier. At {{the time of}} the explosion, the train's third car was approximately 100 yards (90m) along the tunnel from Liverpool Street. The parallel track of the Hammersmith & City line between Liverpool Street and Aldgate East was also damaged in the blast.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of suburban passenger traffic, all trains are provided with a second identification, known as a “service” number. In most cases, the service number is the last 3 characters of the “Train” number with an alpha suffix that identifies the business group to which the train belongs (e.g. Q301/301T - ‘T’ = Traveltrain). At present, control software {{does not support the}} use of five character <b>train</b> <b>numbers.</b> When complete, the service number will disappear and five character <b>train</b> <b>numbers</b> will be introduced. Some <b>train</b> <b>numbers</b> you might hear might be - 1119C, 0FB9Z, C742X, 9Y32M or M594H. The below is a character by character description of the QR <b>Train</b> <b>Numbering</b> system.|$|R

50|$|The initial <b>train</b> <b>numbers</b> of the Transalpin were TS 11/12, and its {{original}} route was Wien Westbf to Zürich HB. In 1959, the route {{was extended to}} Basel (SBB station). When it became a EuroCity train, in 1987, its <b>train</b> <b>numbers</b> became EC 62 westbound and EC 63 eastbound.|$|R
25|$|A third {{bomb was}} detonated on a 6-car London Underground 1973 Stock Piccadilly line deep-level Underground <b>train,</b> <b>number</b> 311, {{travelling}} southbound from King's Cross St Pancras to Russell Square. The device exploded approximately one minute {{after the service}} departed King's Cross, by which time it had travelled about 500 yards (450m). The explosion occurred {{at the rear of}} the first car of the train—number 166—causing severe damage to the rear of that car as well as the front of the second one. The surrounding tunnel also sustained damage.|$|E
25|$|Currently, each {{train on}} the {{schedule}} is assigned a three-digit number indicating direction, sequence and stop pattern. This number {{is not to be}} confused with the locomotive number, which is the 9xx number physically stenciled on each engine. The second and third digits are always displayed on the leading element of the train (either the control car, for northbound trains, or the locomotive, for southbound trains); the MP36-3C locomotives have electronic displays showing all three digits of the <b>train</b> <b>number</b> when travelling southbound; when travelling northbound, the electronic display shows the 9xx locomotive number instead. The practice of placarding train numbers dates back to when the trains were operated by Southern Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The second bomb {{exploded}} in the second car of another six-car London Underground C69 and C77 Stock Circle line sub-surface <b>train,</b> <b>number</b> 216, which had just left platform 4 at Edgware Road and was travelling westbound towards Paddington. The train had left King's Cross St Pancras about eight minutes previously. There were several other trains nearby {{at the time of}} the explosion; an eastbound Circle line train (arriving at platform 3 at Edgware Road from Paddington) was passing next to the bombed train and was damaged, as well as a wall that later collapsed. Two other trains were at Edgware Road: an unidentified train on platform 2 and a southbound Hammersmith & City line service that had just arrived at platform 1.|$|E

25|$|On October 25, 1995, at 7:10am CDT, Metra <b>train</b> <b>number</b> 624, {{traveling}} approximately 60mph (96km/h) at {{the time}} of impact, collided with the back of a school bus carrying students to Cary-Grove High School at the intersection of Algonquin Road, Northwest Highway (U.S. Highway 14) and a double-tracked mainline belonging to the Union Pacific Railroad. The impact separated the body from the chassis of the bus and catapulted the wreckage into the intersection. Five students were instantly killed and two later died from their injuries. Another 21 were injured, some critically. Most victims suffered blunt trauma and head injuries. The most seriously injured suffered skull fractures, lacerations and internal injuries. Police Officers arrived on scene in less than one minute due to the location of the crash being almost directly across from the former Fox River Grove Police Department, as reported by the former police chief and several reporting officers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} carry {{all the people}} wishing to ride on the same train, {{sometimes}} {{it was necessary to}} operate the train in two or more separate parts, which are called 'sections.' [...] When a train is operated in sections, the first section carries a '1' preceding the <b>train</b> <b>number</b> (figure 2). [...] The second section carries a '2', etc., and the last section carries the <b>train</b> <b>number</b> only.

2500|$|Most RPO {{cars had}} a mail slot {{on the side}} of the car, so that mail could {{actually}} be deposited in the car, much like using the corner mail box, while the train was stopped at a station. [...] Those desiring the fastest delivery would bring their letters to the train station for dispatch on the RPO, knowing that overnight delivery would be virtually assured. [...] The mail handled in this manner received a cancellation just as if it had been mailed at a local post office, with the cancel giving the <b>train</b> <b>number,</b> endpoint cities of the RPO route, the date, and RMS Railway Mail Service or PTS Postal Transportation Service between the killer bars.

2500|$|Lhasa {{has been}} served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai–Tibet Railway opened for {{passenger}} operations. Reaching {{an elevation of}} 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some [...] away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China's extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each day. <b>Train</b> <b>number</b> Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every day. Train Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for convenience of passenger, and personal oxygen masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train and are well equipped and have a socket to plug electronics. Lhasa is also connected to the second largest city in Tibet, Xigazê, by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.|$|E
