5|$|Several limited {{events and}} fundraisers have {{occurred}} at <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> center since its construction. Annually, {{during the month}} of October, Lahaina Gateway hosts various events as part of their Pineapples & Pumpkins Halloween festival. The mall also hosted a classic car show that took place in March 2015. In addition, the annual Wiki Wiki Run takes place near <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> center.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. <b>The</b> <b>shopping</b> centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The central part of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E
50|$|In four brief acts, <b>the</b> <b>Shop</b> Hours Act 1892, <b>the</b> <b>Shop</b> Hours Act 1893, <b>the</b> <b>Shop</b> Hours Act 1895 and <b>the</b> Seats for <b>Shop</b> Assistants Act 1899 {{the first}} very limited steps were taken towards the {{positive}} regulation of <b>the</b> employment of <b>shop</b> assistants.|$|R
30|$|To {{disprove}} {{the null}} hypothesis we create a linear model. The model aims at explaining a shop’s retention rate at increasing distances. Then, we characterize <b>the</b> <b>shop’s</b> size using three different measures. The first measure is the total volume of its sales, i.e. {{the number of items}} that have been purchased in <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> A larger shop generates high volumes of sales. The second measure is <b>the</b> <b>shop’s</b> variety or assortment, i.e. the number of different products that can be purchased in <b>the</b> <b>shop.</b> Larger shops have a larger assortment of products. The last measure is <b>the</b> <b>shop’s</b> sophistication. <b>The</b> <b>shop’s</b> sophistication can be viewed as the average sophistication of the products sold at <b>the</b> <b>shop,</b> in <b>the</b> same way as the country sophistication is the average sophistication of the products it exports [7].|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shops</b> {{changed hands}} several times after William Johnston sold the {{property}} in 1917. <b>The</b> <b>shops</b> had been used mostly for hospitality businesses {{in the twentieth century}} including Bunces Cake <b>Shop</b> and <b>the</b> Dorothy Belle Cafe situated in <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> closest to East St and the Metro Cafe in <b>the</b> middle <b>shop.</b>|$|R
5|$|May 28, 2007 saw {{the opening}} of phase one of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> mall {{and part of the}} 600-meter promenade. The {{completion}} of the remainder of the promenade, the Stern House rebuilding, and the other construction, including the 207-room five-star second hotel, was scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2008.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations which use a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations are designed {{to be a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E

50|$|By 1863, <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> in Susquehanna {{employed}} 700 men (up {{from the}} original 350) in the community with $38,000/year average salary. The master mechanic of <b>the</b> <b>shops,</b> James Gregg worked to renovate and improve <b>the</b> <b>shops,</b> which were consistent fire risks. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> began that year {{at the cost of}} $1.25 million (1865 USD) along with $500,000 in tools and machinery along 8 acres.|$|R

5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on her forehead, and made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>shopping</b> {{levels in}} the Clal Building are {{exceptionally}} large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated {{around the perimeter of}} a large, central atrium. Originally the atrium was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} {{is largely}} intact, although {{the frame and}} glass of <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> front window has been replaced and {{the entrance to the}} [...] "shop" [...] is now through a glass door. The parapet above <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> front is supported by free-standing columns with <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> window set in behind. The base of <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> front below <b>the</b> window is in cast iron in an unusual fretwork pattern.|$|R

50|$|Syntactic {{aggregation}} can be {{much more}} complex than this. For example, aggregation can embed one of the constituents in the other; e.g., we can aggregate John went to <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> and <b>The</b> <b>shop</b> was closed into the sentence John went to <b>the</b> <b>shop,</b> which was closed.|$|R

5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes {{from the airport to}} the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for each other who would try to promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shop</b> lay {{untouched}} from 1968 to 1973, {{when the}} fittings and stock were donated to The Black Country Living Museum. <b>The</b> <b>shop</b> now located in The Black Country Living Museum is built using bricks reclaimed from two houses which were demolished in Pearson Street, Old Hill. <b>The</b> original <b>shop</b> front was also rescued and forms {{part of the}} exhibit today. <b>The</b> <b>shop</b> exhibition is much tidier than <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> {{would have been in}} real life. It would have been cluttered with hampers full of deliveries often leaving little room for customers.|$|R
5|$|Bird {{watching}} (primarily in the Hawar Islands), scuba diving, {{and horse}} riding are popular tourist activities in Bahrain. Many tourists from nearby Saudi Arabia {{and across the}} region visit Manama primarily for <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> malls in the capital Manama, such as the Bahrain City Centre and Seef Mall in the Seef district of Manama. The Manama Souq and Gold Souq in the old district of Manama are also popular with tourists.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier {{and replacing it with}} other tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|In week eight, in {{the early}} hours of Day 53, Tom voluntarily left the Big Brother House. For <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> task the housemates split into two groups, {{creating}} human puppets with one housemate providing the head and feet and another providing the arms, and making them dance to music by Girls Aloud and Take That. Visitors to the Big Brother web site decided by voting that the housemates had failed the task. On Day 56, Noirin's ex-boyfriend Isaac entered the House, but left voluntarily shortly after Noirin's eviction on Day 58 with 60.0% of the public vote.|$|E
