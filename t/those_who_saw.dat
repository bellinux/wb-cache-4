5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E
5|$|An anime film {{based on}} the first novel that was {{released}} in Japanese theaters on April 21, 2007 as one of three films released at Dengeki Bunko's Movie Festival. The staff who produced the anime series returned to produce the film. The version shown in theaters was 65 minutes in length. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the film in theaters could buy a short book titled Shakugan no Shana M containing two short stories written by Takahashi published by ASCII Media Works under the imprint Dengeki Gekijō Bunko. The film was released on DVD in Japan on September 21, 2007 in regular and special editions, which featured the full length 90-minute director's cut version. It was later released on Blu-ray Disc (BD) in Japan on July 27, 2011.|$|E
50|$|Inciting {{splitting}} {{of state}} and sabotage of the state unity (煽动分裂国家、破坏国家统一) would also warrant long jail term. The Chinese government used this law to prosecute <b>those</b> <b>who</b> it <b>saw</b> as separatists.|$|R

5|$|Stratton {{provided}} {{encouragement to}} both his students and his children. Early at Berkeley, he encouraged young students to pursue graduate study in psychology, writing personal letters {{to students who}} scored an A grade in his introductory psychology course. The stamp of Stratton's legacy {{can be seen in}} his doctoral students. Knight Dunlap was one of his earliest students at Berkeley and he became the twenty-second president of the American Psychological Association. Dunlap was one of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> Stratton as a guide and mentor. Another of his early students, Warner Brown, would be the chair of the psychology department at Berkeley for sixteen years. A third, Olga Bridgman, would serve on the faculty at University of California—Berkeley and San Francisco—for over forty years.|$|E
5|$|The divines {{were even}} more {{strongly}} opposed to Catholicism than to William Laud and his followers, the Laudians. They associated both Catholicism and Laudianism with Arminianism and persecution. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two groups as {{the greatest threat to}} the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the moral law as in some way no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Western {{attitudes towards}} killer whales have changed {{dramatically}} in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and scientific awareness, {{starting with the}} first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly {{two months before the}} whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

25|$|In May 2017, Maroney {{posted a}} video of herself dancing in a thong on Instagram, which Maroney {{confirmed}} that she posted herself and wasn't hacked.

25|$|As the 2000s emerged, Bad Boy had noticeably floundered. Many of {{its more}} noted acts would {{eventually}} vacate the label, while <b>those</b> <b>who</b> remained <b>saw</b> their album sales dwindle as time went on. In spite of continually releasing new material, and various attempts at building artists {{to the status of}} Bad Boy’s The Notorious B.I.G., few proved as successful as the company hoped.|$|R
60|$|At {{the further}} {{end of the}} bridge Baron Henry had wheeled his horse. Once again he couched lance, and again he drove down upon his bruised and wounded enemy.

25|$|The {{audience}} {{reaction was}} split between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the production as an offence {{and those who}} considered it the best Ring Cycle ever produced. The ensuing conflict, short only of outright riot, between supporters and detractors was unprecedented {{in the history of}} the festival. The performances, and the performers, however, were without dispute some of the best seen in the world of opera.|$|E
25|$|Stanton ordered {{testimony}} {{taken from}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the attack. Witnesses blamed actor John Wilkes Booth for the assassination. Stanton put all soldiers in Washington on guard, {{and ordered a}} lockdown of the city. Rail traffic to the south was to be halted, and fishing boats on the Potomac were not to come ashore. Stanton also called Grant back to the capital from New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|The Liberal reforms {{received}} {{criticism from}} <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> {{this level of}} government action to mitigate social evils as interfering with market forces and thus being antithetical to the operations of a free market. One political cartoon of the time criticised the reforms as socialist in nature. The cost of the reforms was also criticised and there were also critics who suggested that the reforms would not work in practice.|$|E
50|$|Black Dogs is a 1992 {{novel by}} the British author Ian McEwan. It {{concerns}} {{the aftermath of}} the Nazi era in Europe, and how the fall of the Berlin Wall in the late 1980s affected <b>those</b> <b>who</b> once <b>saw</b> Communism as a way forward for society. The main characters travel to France, where they encounter disturbing residues of Nazism still at large in the French countryside.|$|R
50|$|The racial {{policy of}} Nazi Germany {{was a set}} of {{policies}} and laws implemented in Nazi Germany (1933-45) based on a specific racist doctrine asserting {{the superiority of the}} Aryan race, which claimed scientific legitimacy. This was combined with a eugenics programme that aimed for racial hygiene by compulsory sterilization and extermination of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> they <b>saw</b> as Untermenschen ("sub-humans"), which culminated in the Holocaust.|$|R

25|$|The {{passages}} quoted above reflect contrasting {{views on}} the authorship of the Cantong qi, between those who maintained that the text pertained {{in the first place}} to the northern cosmological traditions, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> it as a product of the southern alchemical traditions. Taking this point into account, Pregadio (2011:23-25) has suggested that the final paragraph in the Shenxian zhuans account may have been added at a later time to further the second view.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial enthusiasm by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the design, Burbridge had {{difficulty}} getting orders for substantial numbers and consequently, amid wartime shortages and restrictions, {{could not get}} even the modest amounts of steel and concrete required to manufacture many turrets. In November 1940, they received an order for just four turrets and even these could not be delivered until February 1941. Eventually, the company manufactured 100 turrets, but only sold 31 of them. Only six sites are recorded in the Defence of Britain database.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} atheism re-emerged {{initially}} {{as a reaction}} to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the Age of Enlightenment and the Reformation, as a charge used by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was used exclusively as an insult; nobody wanted to be regarded as an atheist. Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the Theophrastus redivivus was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a lack of moral restraint.|$|E
50|$|After this, {{some of the}} {{survivors}} reported seeing the long-dead inhabitants of Ib peering from {{the windows of the}} city's towers, while others refused to say exactly what they had seen. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> returned <b>saw</b> nothing of those unlucky enough to be left behind, only ruins, many water lizards, and most disturbingly, the missing idol.

50|$|Robert Elsmere {{generated}} enormous {{interest from}} intellectuals and agnostics <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> it as a liberating tool for liberating times and from <b>those</b> of faith <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> it as another {{step in the}} advancement of apostasy or ism.

25|$|The Alliance Party {{was founded}} {{on the back of}} efforts by the New Ulster Movement (NUM), which was {{established}} as a moderating influence upon the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). After Irish nationalist politicians withdrew their role as official Opposition at Stormont, and the resignation of UUP Prime Minister of Northern Ireland Terence O'Neill in 1969, the NUM split between those who wished to remain a pressure group for the UUP and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> reform only through the establishment of a new political party. The latter broke off and formed the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland on 21 April 1970.|$|E
25|$|The term Orientalism {{has come}} to acquire {{negative}} connotations in some quarters and is interpreted {{to refer to the}} study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition. In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> nothing of value in non-Western cultures.|$|E
25|$|The {{bombardment}} of civilian targets caused great outrage among the British public at the time. The commanding officer and three gun captains of the Durham RGA were later decorated, Lt-Col Robson receiving a Distinguished Service Order, Sgt T. Douthwaite a Distinguished Conduct Medal for extracting a live cartridge from the breech of the Lighthouse Battery gun after a misfire, and Acting Bombardier J.J. Hope and Bombardier F.W. Mallin each received the Military Medal. These {{were the first}} two MMs to be gazetted after {{the institution of the}} award in April 1916. Hope's medal was the first MM minted, and the first to be presented. In 1920, all members of the Durham RGA in action that day were made eligible for the British War Medal, normally only awarded to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> active service overseas.|$|E

40|$|Moral {{identity}} was investigated phenomenologically {{as it was}} experienced both by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> adhered to their stated moral convictions as well as <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not. More specifically, 16 adult, unmarried, pro-life women who had experienced an unwanted pregnancy were interviewed, 8 of whom had carried and 8 had aborted. Significant findings include the propensity of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> carried and aborted, alike, to view their moral dilemmas through the filter of protection of self. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> carried <b>saw</b> their moral beliefs as serving their self-interests, but <b>those</b> <b>who</b> aborted did not. Connection with a higher purpose was found in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> carried. A Moral Juncture Model of Self, as conceptualized by the researcher, is presented...|$|R
