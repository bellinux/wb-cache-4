5|$|Chancellor Law's Fountain – Unveiled in May 1871, <b>the</b> <b>fountain</b> was sculpted by Turner and Allen of London. The lions {{are made}} from Ashlar stone and the central figure is sculpted iron. <b>The</b> <b>fountain</b> {{was a gift from}} James Thomas Law who was the {{chancellor}} of the diocese and gave much to the city, including the statue of Samuel Johnson in the market square. <b>The</b> <b>fountain</b> is located at the centre of the Museum Gardens.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fountain</b> Court lies to {{the west}} of the Pitched Stone Court, and is named after a marble {{fountain}} that once stood in the centre of it, featuring a white horse on a black marble base, complete with a flow of running water. <b>The</b> <b>fountain</b> was probably installed somewhat after the initial construction of the court in the 1460s, dating instead to Edward Somerset in the late 16th century; the horse symbolised Edward's prestigious role as Master of the Horse. <b>The</b> <b>Fountain</b> Court was built to provide luxurious accommodation for the family and guests – by the 15th century, it was important to be able to provide private chambers for visitors, and this court could hold up to four distinct groups of visitors in comfort. <b>The</b> <b>Fountain</b> Court as a whole is marked by what Augustus Pugin described as extremely fine, elegant and delicate stonework.|$|E

When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne's Revenge and her crew.

There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross from the corner of the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into <b>the</b> <b>fountain</b> and behind the falling water. <b>The</b> <b>fountain</b> and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E
