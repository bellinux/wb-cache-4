5|$|The side altar {{located on}} the left hand side facing the altar is consecrated to the Santo Niño.

It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to <b>the</b> <b>topmost</b> levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of <b>the</b> <b>topmost</b> gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E

5|$|On {{the left}} side of the altar are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of the altar {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on <b>the</b> <b>topmost</b> level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna and Child) in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} the region {{are known to be}} {{evergreen}} type with a preponderance of deciduous species with a levelled distribution. <b>The</b> <b>topmost</b> level consists of Garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), Telsur (Hopea odorata), Chapalish (Artocarpus chaplasha), Chundul (Tetrameles nudiflora) and Koroi or the Moluccan albizia (Falcataria moluccana). The lower level consists of species of Jarul (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Toon (Toona ciliata), Jam (Syzygium cumini), Jalpai (Elaeocarpus robustus) and Glochidion. Lianas, epiphytes (mostly of orchids, asclepiads, ferns and leafy mosses) and herbaceous undergrowths are abundant. Savannah formations are found in the open, along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like Kans (Saccharum spontaneum), Shon (Imperata cylindrica and I. arundincca) and Bena (Vetiveria zizanoides). Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including Bambusa balcooa (which is also common in Assam), B. vulgaris, B. longispiculata, B. tulda and B. nutans; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region.|$|E
5|$|The geology in Dwarf Fortress {{is fairly}} accurate. Rocks like olivine or gabbro can be dug up. <b>The</b> <b>topmost</b> layer usually {{consists}} of sand, clay or plain soil—this {{can be used}} for underground farming. Deeper levels will be layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or clusters around the right depth. Gems like tourmalines appear in rare clusters. Water is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having one level of water is the lowest, while a tile with seven is full. There is a system for simulating temperature and heat. Fires can spread and burn dwarves and furniture. There are four basic seasons in an in-game year: spring, summer, autumn and winter.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with a portrait of the emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only <b>the</b> <b>topmost</b> carved knots in gold, and the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: he carried the emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse when he left the palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on <b>the</b> <b>topmost</b> level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
5|$|Once inside, Roy {{is shown}} the true history of The Scouring. The dragons, despite their power, {{were unable to}} {{maintain}} their numbers due to how slowly they reproduced compared to humans. As the war came to a close, the surviving Fire Dragons captured a Divine Dragon named Idunn and sealed away her soul. Enslaved to their will, Idunn reproduced dragons at an incredible rate and {{became known as the}} Demon Dragon, but she was defeated by a warrior wielding the Binding Blade. Her power was locked away until Zephiel, disgusted at humanity's failings, released her out of his insane desire to return Elibe to the dragons. As she has no emotion or free will, Idunn continues to follow Zephiel's orders even after his death and threatens to raise a dragon army that will destroy everything on the continent. On <b>the</b> <b>topmost</b> floor of the temple, the Etrurian Army battles Idunn's endlessly spawning dragons, allowing Roy to deliver the final blow on her with the Binding Blade. This does not kill her, and Roy carries her out as the temple collapses behind him. In the war's wake, Elibe begins to rebuild itself. Guinivere is named the new ruler of Bern, while Elffin returns to Etruria after his long absence. Roy and Lilina become the new marquesses of Pherae and Ostia, while Idunn is taken to Arcadia and lives with Fae as her soul slowly returns to her.|$|E
