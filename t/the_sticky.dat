Overall, Madonna performed to over 3.5 million fans in 32 countries, grossing a total of US$408 million, making it also the second highest grossing tour of all time and the highest grossing tour by a solo artist. At the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards, <b>the</b> <b>Sticky</b> & Sweet Tour won the Top Tour and Top Draw prizes, which acknowledge the highest-grossing and highest-attended tours of the year, respectively.

5|$|The {{potential}} of <b>the</b> <b>sticky</b> bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, {{a good example}} being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. <b>The</b> <b>sticky</b> bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>sticky</b> bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic. Finally, after passing all the required tests, <b>the</b> <b>sticky</b> bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E

5|$|To further {{promote the}} album, Madonna {{embarked}} on <b>the</b> <b>Sticky</b> & Sweet Tour, her eighth worldwide concert tour.

5|$|The spores are {{smooth and}} cylindrical, {{sometimes}} {{with a slight}} swelling in the middle, and sometimes slightly curved; they measure 59–65 by 4–5µm. G.glutinosum spores have between two and seven septa, although three is most typical in mature specimens. The thin-walled asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, eight-spored, and typically measure 200–265µm long by 12–16µm wide. Ascospores occupy about the upper two-thirds to three-quarters of the ascus, leaving a hyaline (transparent) base. The paraphyses, hyaline at the base and brown in the upper regions, are 4–11µm wide, and longer than the asci. Cells {{at the end of}} the paraphyses are pear-shaped (piriform) or spherical, brownish, and measure 8–10µm wide. <b>The</b> <b>sticky</b> material on the stipe is a gelatinous matrix made of a layer of paraphyses.|$|E

5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process often takes place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes <b>the</b> <b>sticky</b> brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E

Macrostickies were found to exhibit the same tendencies, although with smaller and less sudden variations.
