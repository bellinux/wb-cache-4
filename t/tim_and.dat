5|$|The {{game was}} created and {{designed}} by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, with Ultimate founders <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper otherwise being uninvolved in development. Entombed took considerably longer to develop {{due to the}} re-programming of its game engine. It received positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise being directed at its playability and graphics. It {{was followed by a}} sequel, Blackwyche, which was released later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate Play the Game {{was founded}} by {{brothers}} <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper, along with Tim's wife, Carol, from their headquarters in Ashby-de-la-Zouch in 1982. Under the trading name of Ultimate Play the Game, they began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s. Prior to founding Ultimate, the Stamper brothers had backgrounds in designing arcade machines, but no marketing experience in the video game sector.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and then picked up <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E

5|$|Rare is a British {{video game}} {{developer}} located in Twycross, Leicestershire. The company {{was established in}} 1985 by <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper, founders of Ultimate Play the Game. During its early years, Rare was backed by an unlimited budget from Nintendo, primarily concentrated on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games. During this time they created successful titles such as Wizards & Warriors, Battletoads, and R.C. Pro-Am. Rare became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo, who came to own a large minority stake of the company. During this period, Rare received international recognition and critical acclaim for games such as Donkey Kong Country, GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Conker's Bad Fur Day.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana's {{announcement}} sparked retaliatory {{actions by}} the Ratsiraka administration, resulting in frequent defamatory attacks {{in the press and}} a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs (55.6 million Euros) in unpaid back taxes, and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko, which were later settled out of court. These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana's campaign support network, Tiako iMadagasikara (<b>TIM),</b> <b>and</b> in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island, with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko. Tiko distribution channels were used to distribute posters, baseball caps, tee-shirts and other promotional materials.|$|E

5|$|Sattler assists the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, in {{a search}} for survivors, but they only find an injured Malcolm, before the Tyrannosaurus returns. Grant, <b>Tim,</b> <b>and</b> Lex take shelter in a treetop. Later, they {{discover}} the broken shells of dinosaur eggs. Grant concludes that the dinosaurs have been breeding, which occurred because of their frog DNA—West African bullfrogs can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a skiing {{video game}} in which the player races {{in a series of}} {{downhill}} slalom runs while navigating past flags and obstacles before time expires. It was developed by Rare and first released by Nintendo for the Nintendo VS. System in 1986. It was then released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America in March1987 and in Europe later that year. The game was developed by <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper and its music was composed by David Wise.|$|E
5|$|Slalom was {{developed}} by British video game company Rare by <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper. Rare had been looking to develop games for consoles {{in the wake of}} rampant computer game piracy in the United Kingdom. They chose the NES for its nascent popularity, though the console had no Western developers, and asked Nintendo for a license. When Nintendo declined, they reverse engineered the console and made a demo, Slalom to show the company. Nintendo was astonished at their effort, and made Rare its first Western developer, beginning a long and close collaboration between Rare and Nintendo of America founder and president Minoru Arakawa.|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} Tim 9, a new {{component of the}} TIM 22. 54 import machinery, which mediates transport of proteins into the inner membrane of mitochondria. Tim 9, an essential protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, shares sequence similarity with <b>Tim</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>Tim</b> 12. Tim 9 {{is located in the}} mitochondrial intermembrane space and is organized into two distinct hetero-oligomeric assemblies with <b>Tim</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>Tim</b> 12. One complex contains <b>Tim</b> 9 <b>and</b> <b>Tim</b> 10. The other complex contains Tim 9, <b>Tim</b> 10 <b>and</b> <b>Tim</b> 12 <b>and</b> is tightly associated with Tim 22 in the inner membrane. The TIM 9. 10 complex is more abundant than the TIM 9. 10. 12 complex and mediates partial translocation of mitochondrial carriers proteins across the outer membrane. The TIM 9. 10. 12 complex assists further translocation into the inner membrane in association with TIM 22. 54...|$|R

5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because of the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg's work {{and because of the}} thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and Digging for Fire.|$|E
5|$|The game centres around Donkey Kong and {{his nephew}} Diddy Kong, who must recover their stolen hoard of bananas from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. Development {{of the game}} first began shortly after Rare's <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper ran {{experiments}} with a Silicon Graphics workstation, rendering realistic 3D sprites. Nintendo became interested in Rare's work and soon acquired 49% of the company which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology for the SNES console. The Stamper brothers expressed an interest to create a standalone Donkey Kong game, and assembled a team of 12 to work on the game over an 18-month development cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created and {{designed}} by brothers Dave and Bob Thomas {{and was the}} first game to be released by Ultimate without founders <b>Tim</b> <b>and</b> Chris Stamper's direct involvement. The Staff of Karnaths setting and visuals were heavily inspired from the 1962 film Jack the Giant Killer. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release. Critics were divided over its graphics and presentation, and criticised the sound. It was followed by a sequel, Entombed, which was released in 1985.|$|E
