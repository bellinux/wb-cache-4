5|$|The huia, {{with the}} {{previously}} endangered saddleback, {{were the two}} species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal insectivore guild in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of Wallace's line; their ecological niche is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and Nothofagus forests; one was the huia and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> kaka.|$|E
5|$|As both battalions {{headed for}} the railway line, gliders {{carrying}} the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade's vehicles and artillery arrived at landing zone 'L'. The KOSB still defending the area were holding out against repeated German attacks but the landing ground was in range of the Germans guns. At the same time 10 Para, closely followed by German armoured vehicles and under mortar fire, reached the clearing. The leading companies had just cleared the woods and started across open ground when the gliders arrived. In the confusion, with both groups under fire, each thought <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> enemy and began shooting back. The Polish anti-tank battery was virtually destroyed and although some vehicles got away {{the majority of their}} guns were trapped in the burning gliders. Some of the pursuing German troops tried to cross the landing zone only to suffer heavy casualties {{at the hands of the}} defending KOSB companies. In the confusion, 'A' Company KOSB, covering the withdrawal of 10 Para, was cut off and eventually forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the New Zealand and Australian Division, {{under the}} command of Major General Alexander Godley, was being formed for {{operations}} in the Dardanelles, and the battalion was attached to the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, one of the two infantry brigades (<b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Australian 4th brigade) that formed the bulk of the division. In April, the division, now part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) embarked for Gallipoli. The Wellington Battalion was landed at Anzac Cove on the afternoon of 25 April, and made its way up to Plugge's Plateau.|$|E
5|$|Following {{these deaths}} Lie {{was unable to}} support his wife. He {{therefore}} sold his school to Oey Kim Hoat and left his position at Zending Press {{to take a job}} as a land surveyor. In the next four years he held various jobs. In 1881 Oey Pek Nio gave birth again. She died soon afterwards and the baby was sent to live with her grandfather father in Gadog, a village to the southeast of Buitenzorg, to be raised. The child died in 1886. Lie published his first books in 1884. Two of these, Kitab Edja and Sobat Anak-Anak, were published by Zending Press. The former was a study book to help students learn to write Malay, while the latter was a collection of stories for children that Aprinus Salam of Gadjah Mada University credits as the first work of popular literature in the Indies. The other two books were published by W. Bruining&Co., based in the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta). One of these, Malajoe Batawi, was a grammar of Malay intended to standardise the language's spelling. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> four-volume syair (a traditional Malay form of poetry) Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari; this book, dealing with a gender-disguised warrior who conquers the Sultanate of Hindustan to save her husband, became one of Lie's best-known works.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington {{was not involved in}} any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E

5|$|In February 1942 the Royal Marines were tasked to organise Commando {{units of}} their own. In total nine Commando units were {{formed by the}} Royal Marines: No. 40, No. 41, No. 42, No. 43, No. 44, No. 45, No. 46, No. 47 and the last, No. 48, which was only formed in 1944. In 1943 two other Commando units were formed. The first was the Royal Naval Commandos, who were {{established}} to carry out tasks associated with establishing, maintaining, and controlling beachheads during amphibious operations. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Royal Air Force Commandos, who would accompany an invasion force either to make enemy airfields serviceable, or to make new airstrips operational and contribute to their defence.|$|E
5|$|Mireille Derebona-Ngaisset participated on the Central African Republic's behalf as a sprinter. She {{took part}} in the women's 800meters for the country, and was the only female Central African athlete at Beijing's Olympic games. Born in 1990, Derebona-Ngaisset was 18 {{years old at the time}} of her {{participation}} in the Beijing Olympics. The qualification round for the event took place on 14 August, where Derebona-Ngaisset took place in the sixth heat against six other athletes. She was, however, disqualified, and did not rank in the event. The leaders of Derebona-Ngaisset's heat included Kenya's Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei (1:59.72) and the Ukraine's Tetiana Petliuk (2:00.00). Of the 42 athletes participating in the event's qualification round, Mireille Derebona-Ngaisset was one of two athletes who did not finish (<b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> United States' Nicole Teter) and the only one in the event to be disqualified that year.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1965, {{following}} on {{from the}} cancellation of the BAC TSR-2 supersonic bomber, the British and French governments announced the signing {{of a pair of}} agreements to cover the two joint projects; one based on the Breguet Aviation Br.121 ECAT ("Tactical Combat Support Trainer") proposal; this would later evolve, after the cancellation of the AFVG, to become the SEPECAT Jaguar. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> AFVG, a larger, variable geometry carrier-capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy (Aéronavale) as well as fulfilling interceptor, tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the RAF.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} a castle was not simply militaristic, but was also {{considered}} to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport. They were first recorded in 1173 as belonging to barons who had rebelled against Henry II, and at least three were motte-and-bailey castles, probably because of the speed and ease with which they could be erected. Hamon de Massey, who owned the Trafford castles and Ullerwood, and Geoffrey de Constentyn, who owned Stockport Castle, were two of the three rebels from Cheshire; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Chester, the owner of Chester Castle. Castles continued to be built in the area, although the last to be built in Greater Manchester were two fortified manor houses near Bury, built more for comfort than as utilitarian military structures. Bury Castle and Radcliffe Tower followed the national trend in the 13th century; they would most likely have acted as the centre of the manor they served.|$|E
5|$|Two {{distinctive}} timber building traditions {{found their}} confluence in Norwegian architecture. One was {{the practice of}} log building with horizontal logs notched at the corners, a technique {{thought to have been}} imported from the peoples to the east of Scandinavia. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> stave building tradition (typically found in stave churches), possibly based on improvements on the prehistoric long houses that had roof-bearing posts dug into the ground. Although there is scant archaeological evidence of actual buildings from the earliest permanent structures, finds of Viking ships (e.g., the Oseberg ship) suggest significant mastery of woodworking and engineering. In the Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway, a Viking chieftain's holding has been reconstructed at the Lofotr Viking Museum.|$|E
