5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{held that}} {{conspiracy}} <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> {{war on the}} United States was not treason. Further, Bollman held that the evidence against both Bollman and Swartwout was insufficient to justify pre-trial detention.|$|E
5|$|Mary's brother, William Ashford, {{launched}} an appeal, and Thornton was rearrested.

5|$|The Hungarians {{recruited}} {{an army of}} 40,000, many drawn locally from Transylvania. Many knights and Hungarian aristocrats followed, one of {{them being}} Stefan Báthory. With them, they brought 500 cannons and other heavy siege equipment. The Moldavians, being fewer in number and seeing that the Hungarians were determined <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> war, started to evacuate the population close to the Hungarian border and blockaded the passages by cutting down trees and placing them on the roads.|$|E
5|$|The Palmerston {{government}} considered {{recognizing the}} Confederacy {{as an independent}} nation.

5|$|The trial got {{underway}} on 20 November 1945. Lacking evidence confirming Bormann's death, the International Military Tribunal tried him in absentia, as permitted {{under article}} 12 of their charter. He {{was charged with}} three counts: conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. His prosecution was assigned to Lieutenant Thomas F. Lambert Jr. and his defence to Dr. Friedrich Bergold. The prosecution stated that Bormann participated in planning and co-signed {{virtually all of the}} antisemitic legislation put forward by the regime. Bergold unsuccessfully proposed that the court could not convict Bormann because he was already dead. Due to the shadowy nature of Bormann's activities, Bergold was unable to refute the prosecution's assertions as to the extent of his involvement in decision making. Bormann was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and acquitted of conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> a war of aggression. On 15 October 1946 he was sentenced to death by hanging, with the provision that if he were later found alive, any new facts brought to light at that time could be taken into consideration to reduce the sentence or overturn it.|$|E

With the combined power of his past lives, Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally understands the lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> war while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon.

A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, while Aang and Katara begin a romantic relationship.|$|E
40|$|The {{elasticity}} of labor supply <b>to</b> real <b>wages</b> has broad and significant implications to understanding economic fluctuations and to evaluating {{the effects of}} economic policies. Recent literature {{emphasizes the importance of}} distinguishing between uncompensated and intertemporal elasticities, controlling for the endogeneity of wages. We use a pseudo-panel of female labor hours and real <b>wages</b> <b>to</b> measure the elastiticities of labor supply <b>to</b> real <b>wages.</b> We find that life cycle theory is supported, with partially concave labor hours that are parallel to the concavity of wages. In addition, the intertemporal and uncompensated elasticities of labor supply <b>to</b> <b>wages</b> are positive but small in magnitude...|$|R

5|$|Aircraft {{were used}} for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role was {{advanced}} considerably. Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> war). Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German 88 mm gun. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{perceived}} the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. Charles {{did not seek}} subsidies from the English Parliament <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> war, but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick-upon-Tweed, {{on the border of}} Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained custody of his Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker's {{successful}} leadership race {{had been}} run by Allister Grosart, an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd. Soon {{after taking the}} leadership, Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters, and soon appointed him national director {{of the party and}} national campaign manager. Grosart appointed a national campaign committee, something which had not been done previously by the Tories, but which, according to Grosart, provided the organizational key to success in 1957. The party was ill-financed, having only $1,000,000 <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> the campaign—half what it had in 1953. Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency, to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories, who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party's financing.|$|E

40|$|Employment at a {{multinational}} enterprise (MNE) responds <b>to</b> <b>wages</b> at the extensive margin, when an MNE enters a foreign location, {{and at the}} intensive margin, when an MNE operates existing affiliates.

Our integrated approach documents salient labor substitution for German manufacturing MNEs and removes bias. In Central and Eastern Europe, most employment responds at the extensive margin, while in Western Europe the extensive margin accounts for around two-thirds of employment shifts.

A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle.

5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, encouraging them <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> {{war on the}} Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or {{for the defense of}} Kentucky, which was left entirely to the local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as a leader in the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje.

It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović <b>to</b> <b>wage</b> a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E
