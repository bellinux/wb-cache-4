5|$|Birds {{in central}} California of the {{subspecies}} propinquus {{are considered to}} be still increasing their range, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> case elsewhere in the U.S.A.|$|E
5|$|The {{plates were}} paired {{in a double}} row along the back. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most common {{arrangement}} in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The Stegosaurus in the 1933 film, King Kong, has this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The Hippocratic Oath, {{a seminal}} {{document}} on {{the ethics of}} medical practice, was attributed to Hippocrates in antiquity although new information shows {{it may have been}} written after his death. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most famous document of the Hippocratic Corpus. Recently the authenticity of the document's author has come under scrutiny. While the Oath is rarely used in its original form today, it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. Such derivatives are regularly taken today by medical graduates about to enter medical practice.|$|E
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{pseudonym}} of Jean Baptiste Joseph Lafontaine {{who made}} himself called [...] "Wanincka" [...] (short for Jean in Russian).|$|R
6000|$|... "The heavy winter {{made him}} {{go a long}} {{distance}} for food, I reckon," [...] answered Henry; and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> correct explanation.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> Domesday mill {{recorded}} at Ulcombe. Chegworth mill was {{also known as}} Lower Mill thus <b>this</b> mill would <b>be</b> the Upper Mill.|$|R
5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|Tyler Walker, the ADR {{director}} of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments that {{because there are a}} lot of characters and most of them are older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.|$|E
25|$|The Annunciation; {{at the top}} of the Dormitory stairs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most {{reproduced}} of all Fra Angelico's paintings.|$|E
5000|$|ZU-23-6 (unofficial designator) - Similar to the Mesbah-1 {{but with}} only 6 instead of 8 barrels. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> pre-series {{model of the}} Mesbah-1.|$|R
50|$|Tlepolemus was {{definitely}} satrap of Carmania {{after the second}} partition, and Diodorus places him as satrap at the first partition, so <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|R
50|$|XPG3 {{followed}} in 1988, its primary focus being convergence with the POSIX operating system specifications. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{most widely used}} and influential deliverable of the X/Open organisation.|$|R
25|$|Increase in {{respiratory}} capacity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} hypothesis, and fits {{well with the}} idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high metabolic rates.|$|E
25|$|Up to 1967 the 44th Army Corps {{was located}} in Arkhangelsk, and then its {{headquarters}} was relocated in Transbaikalia, where it was deployed in the 29 Army. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> former 116th Rifle Corps, raised in 1946 within 2nd Shock Army in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The close {{approach}} of the A9 and scissile phosphates requires {{the presence of a}} high concentration of positive charge. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> source of the observation that divalent metal ions are required at low ionic strength, but can be dispensed with at higher concentrations of monovalent cations.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May, he {{was finally}} told that the lottery was approved, but only on {{condition}} that the Universal-Lexicon was removed from <b>the</b> offer. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most attractive prize.|$|R
25|$|In a 2012 interview, David X. Cohen {{said that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> {{first time that}} a {{mathematical}} theorem was proved in a television script, and that it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Futuramas proudest mathematical moment.|$|R
50|$|Avatars. Players were {{represented}} {{to each other}} as eyeballs. While some earlier games represented players as spacecraft or as dots, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first computer game to represent players as organic beings.|$|R
25|$|The most {{spectacular}} cactus displays are the 500 bright yellow-spined Golden Barrel Cactus (Echinocactus grusonii), the largest being more than 85 years old. They flower in the Spring, and are native to central Mexico. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> best display of Golden Barrels in the world.|$|E
25|$|Duties to women: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most {{familiar}} aspect of chivalry. This would contain {{what is often}} called courtly love, {{the idea that the}} knight is to serve a lady, and after her all other ladies. Most especially in this category is a general gentleness and graciousness to all women.|$|E
25|$|Leonardo's {{treatment}} {{of light in}} paintings such as The Virgin of the Rocks and the Mona Lisa was to change forever {{the way in which}} artists perceived light and used it in their paintings. Of all Leonardo's scientific legacies, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> one that had the most immediate and noticeable effect.|$|E
5000|$|A {{new design}} was {{introduced}} by Pfenninger in 1947 and was named <b>the</b> Elfe 2. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first sailplane to feature a laminar flow airfoil. It crashed due to rudder flutter ...|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was,</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> kingdom {{ruled by}} Lava with Sravasti as its capital. (see MBh 2.29 {{referred}} below). <b>This</b> kingdom <b>was</b> {{defeated by the}} Pandava general Bhima, in his military campaign to the east.|$|R
25|$|On 21 or 22 February 1831 Black Joke {{captured}} a slaver with 300 slaves on board. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> Spanish schooner Primeira. At the time Black Joke was {{acting as a}} tender to Dryad.|$|R
25|$|In some countries, {{including}} the United Kingdom and Ireland, the profession largely regulates itself, {{with the government}} affirming the regulating body's authority. The best known example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> General Medical Council of Britain. In all countries, the regulating authorities will revoke permission to practice in cases of malpractice or serious misconduct.|$|E
25|$|With Igor Novikov and Don Page he {{developed}} the general relativistic theory of thin accretion disks around black holes, and using this theory he deduced that with a doubling of its mass by such accretion a black hole will be spun up to 0.998 of the maximum spin allowed by general relativity, but not any farther. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> maximum black-hole spin allowed in nature.|$|E
25|$|Lassa {{virus is}} a member of the Arenavirida family of viruses. The Lassa virus {{commonly}} spreads to humans from other animals, specifically a rodent known as a natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most common mouse in equatorial Africa, ubiquitous in human households and eaten as a delicacy in some areas. It is also called the natal multimammate rat or African rat.|$|E
50|$|The {{short-lived}} Federal League {{entry in}} New York was the Brooklyn Tip-Tops. The Fed teams had some innovative names, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> only major league team ever {{named for a}} loaf of bread.|$|R
50|$|The show Confidential File on KTTV {{covered the}} 1962 {{convention}} of the Daughters of Bilitis and aired after Confidential File became syndicated nationally; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> first American national broadcast that specifically covered lesbianism.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> truth, {{and having}} glanced back once, {{to see if}} they were still {{pursuing}} him, the Indian kept on, until he was less than fifty feet away from the brink of the cataract.|$|R
25|$|Employees have a {{right under}} s94 of the Act not to be unfairly dismissed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} right, because it would usually be under an action after dismissal that a former employee would complain that his other rights were breached. Firstly, it is unusual to commence litigation against an employer while still working for them. Secondly, some rights such {{as the right to}} reasonable notice before dismissal (s.86) can logically only be breached when someone is dismissed.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the musical}} Elisabeth premi√®red at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. With {{libretto}} by Michael Kunze and music by Sylvester Levay, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> darkest {{portrayal of the}} Empress' life. It portrayed Elisabeth bringing a physical manifestation of death {{with her to the}} imperial court, thus destroying the Habsburg dynasty. The leading role in the premiere was played by Dutch musical singer Pia Douwes. Elisabeth {{went on to become the}} most successful German-language musical of all time and has enjoyed numerous productions around the world.|$|E
25|$|By the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), the {{selective}} domestic breeding of goldfish was firmly established. In 1162, the empress of the Song Dynasty ordered {{the construction of}} a pond to collect the red and gold variety. By this time, people outside the imperial family were forbidden to keep goldfish of the gold (yellow) variety, yellow being the imperial colour. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> reason why there are more orange goldfish than yellow goldfish, even though the latter are genetically easier to breed. The occurrence of other colours (apart from red and gold) was first recorded in 1276.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> famous Captain Jack Musgrave, who had {{charge of}} the watch along the Cryssop, or Kershope, as appears from {{the order of the}} watches {{appointed}} by Lord Wharton, when deputy-warden-general, in 6th Edward VI.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, the SIS {{failed to}} detect the French {{operation}} in which DGSE operatives bombed the Greenpeace vessel, the Rainbow Warrior, killing a photographer. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most significant case of espionage or terrorism in New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> most {{talked about}} {{story of the}} series. Hoch wrote a later story, [...] "The Second Problem of the Covered Bridge", which was {{published}} in EQMM December 1998. Three more stories about the character followed.|$|R
