2500|$|On one hand, it {{was clear}} that viscous {{stresses}} would eventually cause the matter towards the center to heat up and radiate away some of its gravitational energy. On the other hand, viscosity itself was not enough to explain the transport of angular momentum to the exterior parts of the disk. Turbulence-enhanced viscosity was the mechanism thought to be responsible for such angular-momentum redistribution, although the origin of the turbulence itself was not well understood. The conventional -model (discussed below) introduces an adjustable parameter [...] describing the effective increase of viscosity due to <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> within the disk. In 1991, with the rediscovery of the magnetorotational instability (MRI), S. A. Balbus and J. F.

50|$|The world's oceans {{are made}} up of many {{different}} water masses. Each have particular temperature and salinity characteristics {{as a result of the}} location in which they formed. Once formed at a particular source, a water mass will travel some distance via large-scale ocean circulation. Typically, the flow of water in the ocean is described as turbulent (i.e. it doesn't follow straight lines). Water masses can travel across the ocean as <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies,</b> or parcels of water usually along constant density (isopycnic) surfaces where the expenditure of energy is smallest. When these <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> of different water masses interact, they will mix together. With enough mixing, some stable equilibrium is reached and a mixed layer is formed. <b>Turbulent</b> <b>eddies</b> can also be produced from wind stress by the atmosphere on the ocean. This kind of interaction and mixing through buoyancy at the surface of the ocean also plays a role in the formation of a surface mixed layer.|$|E

40|$|A multiple-scale {{model for}} {{compressible}} turbulent flows is proposed. It {{is assumed that}} <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> shocklets are formed primarily by the 'collisions' of large energetic eddies. The extra straining of the large eddy, due to their interactions with shocklets, enhances the energy cascade to smaller eddies.

The <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity {{is determined by the}} total turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of energy transfer from the large scale to the small scale, which is different from the energy dissipation rate. The model coefficients in the modeled turbulent transport equations depend on the ratio of the turbulent kinetic energy of the large scale to that of the small scale, which renders the model more adaptive to the characteristics of individual flow.

However, analogous work over rough walls is sparse despite the fact that many flows of practical interest, particularly in geophysical flows and hydraulic engineering, are over rough walls. This paper presents a priori and a posteriori evaluations of low Reynolds number Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) –based modeling approaches for flows over rough walls with the help of high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) data. The LES data allow the calculation of the vertical distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy, the dissipation rate, the specific dissipation rate, and the <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity, so that the assumptions inherent of RANS-based turbulence models can be tested a priori.

Our {{results show that}} the vortices are largely deformed due to strong <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> motion while a sinusoidal Crow instability develops. Vortex rising is found to be caused by the updrafts (thermals) during daytime convective conditions and increases with increasing nondimensional turbulence intensity eta. In the downdraft region of the convective boundary layer, vortex sinking is found to be accelerated proportional to increasing eta, with faster speed than that in an ideal line vortex pair in an inviscid fluid. Wake vortices are also shown to be laterally transported over a significant distance due to large <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> motion.

A time-averaged (steady state) bubble driven flow model has been developed using a full scale air-water model of part of an aluminium reduction cell as a test-bed. Simulated results have been compared with experimental data taken under similar conditions using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Good agreement has been obtained between the CFD model and the PIV measurements, which demonstrates the validity of extending the current CFD model to study the effect of various design parameters (e. g. inter-anode gap, insertion of a slot) on bath flow in an industrial cell.

It is assumed that the local rate of entrainment is consisted of two components; one is the component of entrainment due to jet momentum while {{the other is the}} component of entrainment due to buoyancy. The integral models of the mass, momentum and concentration fluxes are obtained and transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations using some similarity transformations. The resulting system is solved to determine the centerline quantities which are used to get the mean axial velocity, mean concentration and mean density of the jet. Therefore, the centerline and mean quantities are used together with the governing equation to determine some important turbulent quantities such as, cross-stream velocity, Reynolds stress, velocity- concentration correlation, <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity and <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> diffusivity.

The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> length scale on blood cell damage, and in particular {{to test the hypothesis}} that only eddies similar in size to blood cells can cause damage. The microscale flow near a red blood cell (RBC) in an idealized <b>turbulent</b> <b>eddy</b> is modelled computationally using an immersed boundary method.

The model predicts that within a given flow field, however, eddies of sub-cellular scale are less damaging than larger eddies. Eddy decay time and the turbulent energy spectral density are highlighted as important factors.
