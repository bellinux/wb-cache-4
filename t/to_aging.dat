5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E

25|$|The DNA damage {{theory of}} aging proposes that aging is a {{consequence}} of unrepaired accumulation of naturally occurring DNA damages. Damage in this context is a DNA alteration that has an abnormal structure. Although both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage can contribute <b>to</b> <b>aging,</b> nuclear DNA is the main subject of this analysis. Nuclear DNA damage can contribute <b>to</b> <b>aging</b> either indirectly (by increasing apoptosis or cellular senescence) or directly (by increasing cell dysfunction).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{portfolio}} examines attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> {{in older}} adults, and explores {{the impact that}} attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> have on mental health status and quality of life. Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> are becoming more widely measured in older adults, particularly {{with the ageing population}} but also due the recent development of the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Ageing</b> Questionnaire. There is growing evidence to suggest a relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and mental health status in older adults. However, no study has explored the association between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life in older adults, incorporating the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Ageing</b> Questionnaire and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life measures. Firstly a systematic search of studies exploring the relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and mental health in older adults (≥ 55 years) was undertaken. All potentially relevant studies were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Variables related <b>to</b> attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing,</b> ageism, age stereotypes, depression and anxiety were considered in this review. Twelve papers met inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The setting, culture and measures incorporated varied across the studies. A negative attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was associated with poorer mental health status in older adults across all 12 studies. The second part of this portfolio was an international cross-sectional analysis of attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life in older adults (≥ 57 years). Correlation and regression analyses explored the relationship between attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and QOL and investigated the impact of socio-demographic variables, depression and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> on two quality of life measures. The two constructs were positively related; a more positive attitude <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was associated with a better quality of life. Further, positive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} a better QOL. The sample was then divided into two age groups (57 - 79 years and 80 + years) and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life ratings were compared. Results revealed more negative ratings in attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and quality of life in the over 80 year old age group. Correlation and regression analyses were then explored across both age groups. More positive attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> was a significant predictor of better quality of life across both age groups. Overall, the two studies in this thesis portfolio highlight the need to better recognise and target older adults’ negative attitudes <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> Appropriate psychological interventions could be provided to challenge negative attitudes and promote attitude change in an attempt to improve mental health difficulties and quality of life in older adults. Continued use of the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Ageing</b> Questionnaire and quality of life psychometric measures in clinical practice and research is encouraged...|$|R

An exploratory, descriptive mixed-methods design was utilised. A purposive sampling method was used to select 154 older adults aged between 75 and 99 years from three different nationalities. Semi-structured interviews were performed, addressing two core areas: subjective <b>age</b> and adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> Data was subjected to content analysis. Representation of the correlational structure of the precategories in our study (subjective age and indicators of adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing)</b> were analysed by a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Standardised instruments measured regular cognitive abilities. Five categories derived from interviews for subjective age: ‘adapted’, ‘disconnected’, ‘old’, ‘youthful’ and ‘tolerant’. A total of seven categories emerged as indicators of adjustment to ageing: ‘social networking’, ‘health’, ‘time perspective’, ‘spirituality’, ‘financial autonomy’, ‘professional activities’ and ‘fulfilment and leisure’. These results supported a model for each pre-category. Subjective age was explained by a two-factor model: ‘age-conscientious’ and ‘youthful’. A three-dimensional model formed by ‘reconciled’, ‘satisficers’ and ‘maximisers’ was indicated as a best-fit solution for adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing.</b> A three-dimensional overall model for PAP was formed by ‘age-cognisant’, ‘fulfilled’ and ‘satisficers’. The findings highlighted the underdeveloped potential of subjective <b>age,</b> adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> and a personal age perception overall model for this population. Enhancing subjective <b>age</b> and adjustment <b>to</b> <b>ageing</b> might be an important target to improve older adults’ interventions’ outcomes...|$|R

As she was unable to hunt and kill for herself, park staff provided her with food.

25|$|DNA {{damage has}} been one of the many causes in {{diseases}} related <b>to</b> <b>aging.</b> The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by Gioacchino Failla in 1958 is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist Leó Szilárd. This theory has changed over the years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.|$|E

The money would raised through increases in taxes and fees that would have raised an estimated $4 billion in revenue over four years. The Democratic-controlled Senate supported the plan, but the Republican-controlled House was ultimately unwilling to approve the taxes necessary {{to carry out the}} project, however, and the effort failed even after a special session of the Legislature was called over the transportation-funding stalemate.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} free {{radicals}} are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues. In 1956, Denham Harman proposed the free-radical theory {{of aging and}} even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems. Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as we age, including diseases related <b>to</b> <b>aging,</b> such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.|$|E
