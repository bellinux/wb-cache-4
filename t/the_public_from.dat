5|$|Brownsea Island is {{generally}} open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> March to October, via ferry from Poole. The island {{was reserved for}} Scouts and Scouters on 1 August 2007 during the Sunrise Camp. The National Trust operates a number of events throughout the summer months including guided tours, trails, and activities in the visitor centre.|$|E
5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often prevents <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> becoming {{informed about}} the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released {{as part of a}} lawsuit against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, but it also led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|Located atop a {{mountain}} in the Gongen Mountain Park, Seto Wind Hill Park {{is located in the}} center of the peninsula and is free and open to <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> <b>From</b> it you can see dozens of Ikata's 29.5-meter, 4.3-ton windmills, and get up close to 11 of them. An actual wing of one of the windmills is on display in the park so visitors can get a better idea of the actual size. Benches and observation decks dot the park and Haikus about the windmills, submitted for Ikata's Windmill Festival, are on display year-round.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, the Council's secrecy {{has been}} criticized as {{contrary}} to {{its status as a}} symbol of racial harmony in Singapore. The discharge of such a role requires that the PCMR projects an image of effectiveness, which the current requirement of secrecy arguably impedes. Secret discussions also prevent <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> being informed about controversial issues that may have arisen in the course of implementing new laws, especially those which may affect the rights of minorities.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1834, Lafayette died on 6 rue d'Anjou-Saint-Honoré in Paris (now 8 rue d'Anjou in the 8th {{arrondissement}} of Paris) {{at the age}} of 76. He {{was buried}} next to his wife at the Picpus Cemetery under soil from Bunker Hill, which his son Georges Washington sprinkled upon him. King Louis-Philippe ordered a military funeral in order to keep <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> attending. Crowds formed to protest their exclusion.|$|E
5|$|Secret Mountain Fort Awesome is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Peter Browngardt that debuted in 2011 on Cartoon Network. The show revolves around a fraternity of five monsters who unleash wild stunts upon <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> their eponymous mountain fort. The show is {{loosely based on}} the antagonists that appeared in Browngardt's animated short, Uncle Grandpa, and employs Mike Conte of the heavy metal band Early Man as composer.|$|E

5|$|The USS Slater (DE-766), {{which is}} the only {{destroyer}} escort still afloat in the United States, sits at Steamboat Square near the foot of Madison Avenue. The ship is open from April to November to the public. The destroyer closes to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> December to March and moves from the Steamboat Square to the port's Rensselaer side. In August 2008 part of the Japanese film Orion in Midsummer (scheduled for release in spring 2009) was filmed on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} Grade II* listed, and is {{surrounded}} by parkland and formal gardens, which are included as GradeII on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. On the site are a grotto, an ice house, and an ornamental obelisk, all Grade II listed structures. Rode Hall is still owned and occupied by the Wilbrahams, currently by the 8th Baronet, Sir Richard Baker Wilbraham, and his wife, Lady Anne Baker Wilbraham. The hall and gardens are open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> April to September.|$|E
5|$|The house {{remained}} {{in the possession of}} the Moreton family for almost 450 years, until ownership was transferred to the National Trust in 1938. Little Moreton Hall and its sandstone bridge across the moat are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and the ground on which Little Moreton Hall stands is protected as a Scheduled Monument. The house has been fully restored and is open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> April to December each year.|$|E

5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} files would {{be placed in the}} CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard was {{captured}} in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands {{several times in the}} Hundred Years' War, but in 1449 the French king captured Château Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey is open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt {{ordered the}} statue to be {{transferred}} to the National Park Service (NPS). In 1937, the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe's Island. With the Army's departure, the NPS began to transform the island into a park. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) demolished most of the old buildings, regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island, and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear. The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue, temporarily removing the rays from the statue's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced. Rusted cast-iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced, as well. Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal. The statue was closed to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> May until December 1938.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, when Bakili Muluzi became president, he {{addressed}} the nation's need for a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, Muluzi introduced another five-year policy known as the National Strategic Framework, but, like Banda's five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan, this plan was largely ineffective. In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, the National Arts Council (NAC) stopped funding unscripted {{performance}} art following a controversial performance by Josef Ng that {{was regarded as}} obscene by many members of <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> <b>From</b> that time, Tang and other {{performance art}}ists mostly practised their art abroad, although some performances were presented in Singapore as dance or theatre. For his originality and influence in performance art in Southeast Asia, among other things, Tang won the Arts and Culture Prize in 1999 at the 10th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes. The NAC eventually reversed its no-funding rule on performance art in September 2003. Tang {{was one of four}} artists who represented Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale. Tang's work is part of the collection of the Singapore Art Museum, Queensland Art Gallery and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} block {{was not a}} gated complex. Located {{on the corner of}} Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> two sides. Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was {{on the opposite side of}} the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare legal procedure to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> his walks on top of the towers and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E
5|$|The safety fougasse design had the {{advantage}} that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe {{that it did not}} require a guard. Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>from</b> accidents. The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic, becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture. Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape, {{it would not have been}} a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation.|$|E
