Such units could, in theory, be replaced by general units of the same dimension, for example the barrel (42 US gallons, 34.97 imperial gallons or 159.0 litres) used {{in the oil industry}} has the dimension of volume and could be replaced by the gallon, cubic metre or litre.|$|E
25|$|Clinicians have a {{wide range}} of {{individual}} interventions to draw from, often guided by their training—for example, a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) clinician might use worksheets to record distressing cognitions, a psychoanalyst might encourage free association, while a psychologist trained in Gestalt techniques might focus on immediate interactions between client and therapist. Clinical psychologists generally seek to base their work on research evidence and outcome studies as well as on trained clinical judgment. Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> dozens of recognized therapeutic orientations, their differences can often be categorized on two dimensions: insight vs. action and in-session vs. out-session.|$|E

25|$|The modal {{concepts}} in Persian folk music are directly linked {{with that of}} the classical music. However, improvisation plays a minor role as folk tunes are characterized by relatively clear-cut melodic and rhythmic properties. The function of each folk melody determines its mood. The varying aesthetic requirements of wedding songs, lullabies, love songs, harvest songs, dance pieces, etc., are met with transparent and appropriate simplicity. The majority of the classical instruments are too elaborate and difficult for the folk musicians. Instead, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> dozens of musical instruments of various sorts found among the rural people. In fact, each region of the country can boast instruments peculiar to itself. Three types of instruments, however, are common to all parts of the country. They are, a kind of shawm called Surnay (or Sorna ~ Zorna), the various types of Ney (flute), and the Dohol, a doubleheader drum.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{time goes}} through a pattern {{throughout}} its entirety of one 4:4 bar, one 2:4 bar and then two 4:4 bars. In writing [...] "Lost and Running", the band was influenced by bands that they have cited as being influences on their music from early on, including David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Neil Young. In an interview with The Courier Mail, Fanning noted that the song was a very simple one, stating [...] "the actual style of song is quite different as it has very little movement. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> only three chords in the song."" [...] He notes that the song's premise is reflective on how the group approached the recording of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, in that they were unsure of {{what they wanted to}} do with the album.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> {{hundreds}} {{of different types}} of synapses. [...] In fact, there are over a hundred known neurotransmitters, and many of them have multiple types of receptors. [...] Many synapses use more than one neurotransmitter—a common arrangement is for a synapse to use one fast-acting small-molecule neurotransmitter such as glutamate or GABA, along with one or more peptide neurotransmitters that play slower-acting modulatory roles. [...] Molecular neuroscientists generally divide receptors into two broad groups: [...] chemically gated ion channels and second messenger systems. [...] When a chemically gated ion channel is activated, it forms a passage that allows specific types of ions to flow across the membrane. [...] Depending on the type of ion, the effect on the target cell may be excitatory or inhibitory. [...] When a second messenger system is activated, it starts a cascade of molecular interactions inside the target cell, which may ultimately produce a wide variety of complex effects, such as increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of the cell to stimuli, or even altering gene transcription.|$|E
2500|$|Game Informers Matthew Kato {{scored the}} GameCube version 9.25 out of 10, calling it [...] "a {{blueprint}} {{on how to}} make a very good movie-based game." [...] IGN's Douglass C. Perry scored it 8 out of 10. Comparing the game to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions, he wrote [...] "the textures are much more clean, the rough edges are all smoothed out, and the particle lighting effects are even slightly more radiant than before." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5. He was critical of the length, and that it did not improve on the PlayStation 2 version; [...] "think that the extra two months you waited for the GameCube version of the game allowed E.A. to fix the sometimes-problematic archery aiming, increase the framerate from 30, add extra polygons to the characters and foes, and tweak the water reflections so they actually look realistic? Then you're smoking more pipe-weed than the whole of Hobbiton. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> no differences between this, the Xbox, and the PlayStation 2 offerings." ...|$|E

It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me. But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are. If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is. But if they don't, I totally understand. There's a lot of really cool stuff. What I'm hoping is that as time goes on...

2500|$|Companies {{chose to}} support CP/M {{because of its}} large library of software. The Xerox 820 ran the {{operating}} system because [...] "where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> thousands of programs written for it, it would be unwise not {{to take advantage of}} it", Xerox said. By 1984 Columbia University used the same source code to build Kermit binaries for more than a dozen different CP/M systems, plus a generic version. The operating system was described as a [...] "software bus", allowing multiple programs to interact with different hardware in a standardized way. Programs written for CP/M were typically portable among different machines, usually requiring only the specification of the escape sequences for control of the screen and printer. This portability made CP/M popular, and much more software was written for CP/M than for operating systems that ran on only one brand of hardware. One restriction on portability was that certain programs used the extended instruction set of the Z80 processor and would not operate on an 8080 or 8085 processor. Another was graphics routines, especially in games and graphics programs, which were generally machine specific as they used direct hardware access for speed, bypassing the OS and BIOS (this was also a common problem in early DOS machines).|$|E

From a distance nothing is easier than to smile at this sort of thing, but he must have a cool head who can keep his pulse level when just such a wildcat town--ten houses, two churches, and a line of rails--gets 'on the boom,' The reader at home says, 'Yes, but it's all a lie.' It may be, but--did men lie about Denver, Leadville, Ballarat, Broken Hill, Portland, or Winnipeg twenty years ago--or Adelaide when town lots went begging within the memory of middle-aged men? Did they lie about Vancouver six years since, or Creede not twenty months gone? Hardly; and it is just this knowledge that leads the passer-by to give ear to the wildest statements of the wildest towns. Anything is possible, especially among the Rockies where the minerals lie over and above the mining towns, the centres of ranching country, and the supply towns to the farming districts. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> scores upon scores of lakelets in the hills, buried in woods now, that before twenty years are run will be crowded summer resorts. You in England have no idea of what 'summering' means in the States, and less of the amount of money that is spent on the yearly holiday. People have no more than just begun to discover the place called the Banff Hot Springs, two days west of Winnipeg.[1] In a little time they will know half-a-dozen spots not a day's ride from Montreal, and it is along that line that money will be made. In those days, too, wheat will be grown for the English market four hundred miles north of the present fields on the west side; and British Columbia, perhaps the loveliest land in the world next to New Zealand, will have her own line of six thousand ton steamers to Australia, and the British investor will no longer throw away his money on hellicat South American republics, or give it as a hostage to the States. He will keep it in the family as a wise man should. Then the towns that are to-day the only names in the wilderness, yes, and some of those places marked on the map as Hudson Bay Ports, will be cities, because--but it is hopeless to make people understand that actually and indeed, we do possess an Empire of which Canada is only one portion--an Empire which is not bounded by election-returns on the North and Eastbourne riots on the South--an Empire that has not yet been scratched.|$|E
