25|$|A 1959-1970 bear study {{suggested}} {{a grizzly bear}} population size of about 176, later revised to about 229. Later estimates have ranged as low as 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236, but biologists <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> {{be as many as}} 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan's definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued habitat loss, climate change, and increasing human activities may well reverse the trend.|$|E

Simek continues that the notion of an eternal battle and daily resurrection appears in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum and in reports of the eternal battle of Hjaðningavíg.|$|E

2500|$|According to John Lindow, Andy Orchard, and Rudolf Simek {{connections}} are commonly drawn between the Harii and the Einherjar of Norse mythology; {{those that have}} died and gone to Valhalla ruled over by the god Odin, preparing for the events of Ragnarök. Lindow says that regarding the theorized connection between the Harii and the Einherjar, [...] "many scholars <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be basis for the myth in an ancient Odin cult, which would be centered on young warriors who entered into an ecstatic relationship with Odin" [...] and that the name Harii has been etymologically connected to the -herjar element of einherjar.

2500|$|Wallace {{retracted}} the invitation, and (after considering Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders) chose former Air Force General Curtis LeMay of California. LeMay {{was considered}} {{instrumental in the}} establishment in 1947 of the United States Air Force and an expert in military affairs. His four-star military rank, experience at Strategic Air Command and presence advising President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis were considered foreign-policy assets to the Wallace campaign. By 1968, LeMay had retired and was serving {{as chairman of the}} board of an electronics company, but the company threatened to dismiss him if he took a leave of absence to run for vice president. To keep LeMay on the ticket, Wallace backer and Texas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt set up a million-dollar fund to reimburse LeMay for any income lost in the campaign. Campaign aides tried to persuade LeMay to avoid questions relating to nuclear weapons, but when asked if he thought their use was necessary to win the Vietnam War, he first said that America can win in Vietnam without them. [...] However, he alarmed the audience by further commenting, [...] "we [...] have a phobia about nuclear weapons. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons." [...] The [...] "politically tone-deaf" [...] LeMay became a drag on Wallace's candidacy for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

History has always believed the four killers were lone wolves, but Beecher <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be more than meets the eye. Beecher discovers that all four assassins were working together {{over the course of}} a hundred years. But questions still remain to be answered: Why were they working together? Who do they work for? And what are their plans for the current President? Beecher and the team from The Inner Circle return to uncover the answers and face down the fifth assassin.|$|R

5000|$|When the Doctor takes Lucie {{back to the}} TARDIS she’s worried he’s {{planning}} to take off and leave Straxus to his fate, but he tells her it’s time to use their last remaining ounce of power. While he activates the ship’s telepathic circuits {{to see if the}} Sisterhood are still around, he sends Lucie back to Straxus with some water. The weakened Time Lord is sceptical when he learns the Doctor is trying to contact the Sisterhood as he believes they’ll have been one of Morbius’s first targets for vengeance. Lucie wonders what happened to her friend Rosto and she’s surprised when Straxus tells her he’s still here. He says they injected him with whatever Zarodnix was using to control the Trell and ever since then, he’s been the one who collects Straxus and takes him to Morbius.

Taking a wide view of the field, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be several cases in which a resort to the infliction of physical pain as the only available means of establishing authority may be the only alternative.

60|$|At this time, {{my mother}} {{must have been}} dead; for of her I retain no {{recollection}} whatever. I think, my father left Halifax some time before the prince. Major Walker, too, went to England; leaving Mrs. Walker in Nova Scotia, for some time. Whether my father went away with {{a part of the}} regiment to which he belonged, or not, I cannot say but I well remember a conversation between the prince, the major and Mrs. Walker, in which they spoke of the loss of a transport, and of Meyers's saving several men. This must have been at the time when my father quitted Nova Scotia; to which province, I think, he never could have returned. Neither my sister, nor myself, ever saw him afterwards. We have understood that he was killed in battle; though when, or where, we do not know. My old shipmate, the editor, however, thinks it must have been in Canada; as letters were received from a friend in Quebec, after I had quitted Nova Scotia, inquiring after us children, and stating that the effects of my father were in that town, and ought to belong to us. This letter gave my sister the first account of his death; though it was not addressed to her, but to those in whose care she had been left. This property was never recovered; and my shipmate, who writes this account, <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> have been legal difficulties in the way.|$|R

6000|$|Of course, this {{treatment}} {{in and of}} itself would appear too transparent, and would fail to inspire the patient with a proper confidence. But nowadays this element is supplied by the work of the analytical laboratory. Whatever is wrong with the patient, the doctor insists on snipping off parts and pieces and extracts of him and sending them mysteriously away to be analysed. He cuts off a lock of the patient's hair, marks it, [...] "Mr. Smith's Hair, October, 1910." [...] Then he clips off {{the lower part of the}} ear, and wraps it in paper, and labels it, [...] "Part of Mr. Smith's Ear, October, 1910." [...] Then he looks the patient up and down, with the scissors in his hand, and if he sees any likely part of him he clips it off and wraps it up. Now this, oddly enough, is the very thing that fills the patient up with that sense of personal importance which is worth paying for. [...] "Yes," [...] says the bandaged patient, later in the day to a group of friends much impressed, [...] "the doctor <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a slight anaesthesia of the prognosis, but he's sent my ear to New York and my appendix to Baltimore and a lock of my hair to the editors of all the medical journals, and meantime I am to keep very quiet and not exert myself beyond drinking a hot Scotch with lemon and nutmeg every half-hour." [...] With that he sinks back faintly on his cushions, luxuriously happy.|$|R
