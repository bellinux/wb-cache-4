500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as long as I have been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E

The team adopted a motto – [...] "Every Man a Tiger" [...] – {{and went on to}} score 174 points while allowing its opponents just 29 points. The Tiger nickname continued with students and alumni, eventually being adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis in 1939.|$|E

"Maiden," [...] replied Ranald, [...] "hadst thou dwelt {{longer with}} us, thou wouldst have better learnt {{to know how}} to {{distinguish}} the accents of <b>truth.</b> <b>To</b> <b>that</b> Saxon lord, and to the Knight of Ardenvohr, I will yield such proofs of what I have spoken, that incredulity shall stand convinced. Meantime, withdraw--I loved thine infancy, I hate not thy youth--no eye hates the rose in its blossom, though it groweth upon a thorn, and for thee only do I something regret what is soon to follow.

6000|$|How {{was it that}} {{a simple}} country girl should be the object of fear and {{trembling}} to such an accomplished gentleman as Mr. Pen? His worldly tactics and diplomacy, his satire {{and knowledge of the}} world, could not bear the test of her purity, he felt somehow. And he had to own to himself that his affairs were in such a position, that he could not tell the <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> honest soul. As he rode from Clavering to Baymouth he felt as guilty as a schoolboy who doesn't know his lesson and is about to face the awful master. For is not truth the master always, and does she not have the power and hold the book? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And true holiness.' That is, truthful holiness, honest holiness. This is St. Paul's meaning. As {{any good}} scholar or divine would tell you, St. Paul's exact words are 'the holiness of truth.' He {{does not mean}} true holiness {{as opposed to a}} false holiness, a legal holiness, a holiness of empty forms and ceremonies, or a holiness of ascetism and celibacy; but as opposed to a holiness which does not speak the <b>truth,</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> sly, untruthful, prevaricating holiness which was only too common in St. Paul's time, and has been but too common since. Be honest, says St. Paul; for this too is part of the Godlike life, and the new man is created after God, in justice and honesty.|$|E

Hunter never played in the minor leagues and his first major league victory came on July 27, 1965 in Fenway Park against the Boston Red Sox. In 1966 and 1967, Hunter was named to the American League All-Star team.|$|E

That was {{followed}} by a controversial race where drivers drove in a single file line {{all the way around the}} track for a few segments. Many fans believed and still believe that that was a protest by the drivers to the new rule. Jimmie Johnson and Jamie McMurray all defended their actions. Johnson responded by saying, [...] "No, there's not <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> When we hit single-file like that, we just know there's no need to race at that point. All that matters is from that last pit stop on." [...] Instead of deciding to wreck and dwindle down the field on Sunday, Johnson said the drivers finally got smart about how to approach the race. Everyone seemed to realize that you can't win if you aren't around at the end.|$|E

There's <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> but don't discount their often overlooked musicianship and production, which helps elevate The Shanes' music from basic folk pop to worship music that is powerful, captivating, and intelligent." [...] Cross Rhythms' Tom Lennie noted how [...] "the lyrics are profound and intimate, the music creative, with interesting, varied percussion overlaid with deft guitar (and a touch of banjo/accordion in places) all topped with this duo's intense, yearning vocals." [...] Josh Taylor of Jesus Freak Hideout evoked that [...] "it seems the entire disc is aiming to please the fans that did not start listening because of the 'catchy pop' side of them." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Big Withdraw was {{intended}} to be Lloyd Banks's second album. The album was leaked to the internet after Banks had a ménage à trois encounter with two women and left the CD album behind. The leaked version of the album contained 23 tracks.During an interview, Lloyd Banks commented on the issue, he said: [...] It's <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> rumor. That comes from me doing too much. I was just lost in my ways, fucked two women at one time. It's the little things you don't pay attention to. I had the CD in an actual DJ Whoo Kid mixtape cover. It was just a blank CD with just tracks. I got over 70, 80 tracks, so you can't get them all on one CD. So I might have had 14 tracks of the last two weeks or something like that. Next thing I know, I can't find the CD. I'm assuming it had to be from one of those situations when you got too much going on around you. Maybe I'mma just stick to one girl from now on. That's the only explanation that makes sense. Sticky fingers.|$|E

For {{one of the most}} venerable scholarly theories of Australian politics appears to be making a comeback. The “convergence thesis” – which holds that the main Australian political parties will, over time, converge upon near-identical policy positions on most issues – was on full display last week. The Coalition government did a convincing job of producing a Labor budget, with some sops to small business, while the opposition did its best to promise more of the same, unfunded. Credible plans for a balanced budget and the much more demanding task of intergenerational equity were studiously ignored by both sides. Media commentators often see this as the failings of our “political class” {{to step up to the}} challenges of leadership, and there is definitely some <b>truth</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> But there are underlying systemic pressures towards convergence that are particularly strong in Australia...|$|E
