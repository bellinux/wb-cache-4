Due to Germany's deteriorating position, the flotilla was directed in January to leave Norwegian waters {{and return to}} the Baltic.

5|$|Roosevelt {{had served}} almost <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> of McKinley's term. On {{the night of}} his own {{election}} in 1904, Roosevelt publicly declared he would not run for re-election in 1908, a pledge he quickly regretted. But he felt bound by his word. Roosevelt believed Taft was his logical successor, although the War Secretary was initially reluctant to run. Roosevelt used his control of the party machinery to aid his heir apparent. On pain of loss of their jobs, political appointees were required to support Taft or remain silent.|$|E

5|$|A {{major focus}} for Kenyatta {{during the first}} <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> of Kenya's {{independence}} were the divisions within KANU itself. Opposition to Kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of Pio Pinto in February 1965. Relations between Kenyatta and Odinga were strained, and at the March 1966 party conference, Odinga's post—that of party Vice President, was divided among eight different politicians. In 1966, Odinga stepped down as state Vice President, claiming that Kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt truly socialist policies. Backed by several other senior KANU figures and trade unionists, he formed the Kenya Peoples Union (KPU). The KPU were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Edward VI on 6July 1553, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who had led the young King's {{government}} for the last <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years,</b> tried to install his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey on the English throne; she was the King's Protestant cousin to whom Edward had willed the Crown, bypassing his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. When Mary Tudor asserted her right to the throne, an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable. Northumberland marched on 14July, accompanied by his eldest sons, John and Ambrose. Five days later the Privy Council changed sides; on hearing this on 20July, Northumberland, who had been staying at Cambridge, gave up and was arrested with his party the next day.|$|E
5|$|Planned as {{the first}} chapter of a trilogy from the very beginning, Mass Effect was {{developed}} over the course of <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> and uses the Unreal Engine 3 as a groundwork. It was designed so that the player would assume the role of a central character that could make important decisions and impact the story of the game in numerous ways. The combat was designed to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and real-time third-person shooter interface. In 2008 and 2009, two downloadable content packs that introduced new missions to the base game were released.|$|E

5|$|Ruggiero di Lauria {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia {{shipyard}} on 3 August 1881 and launched on 9 August 1884. She was not completed for another <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years,</b> her construction finally being finished on 1 February 1888. Because of the rapid pace of naval technological development in the late 19th century, her lengthy construction period meant {{that she was an}} obsolete design by the time she entered service. The year after she entered service, the British began building the , the first pre-dreadnought battleships, which marked a significant step forward in capital ship design. In addition, technological progress, particularly in armor production techniquesfirst Harvey armor and then Krupp armorrapidly rendered older vessels like Ruggiero di Lauria obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws {{enable it to}} swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult for}} the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years,</b> the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years,</b> and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{accession}} Chamberlain considered {{calling a}} general election, but with <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> remaining of the then current Parliament's term {{he decided to}} wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election, and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.|$|E
5|$|He spent <b>three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> at Oxford, {{playing a}} total of 145 games for the club. Shortly after the 2008–09 season he was released, and joined Stevenage on a free {{transfer}} in May 2009. His first season at the club was a successful one, finishing the season as the club's top goalscorer, as well as helping the Hertfordshire outfit earn promotion to the Football League {{for the first time}} in the club's history. In January 2011, Odubade joined Newport County on loan until the end of the 2010–11 campaign. On returning to his parent club, Odubade signed for Conference Premier side Gateshead on a free transfer in June 2011. After spending two years at Gateshead, during which he spent a brief time on loan at Forest Green Rovers, Odubade then joined Eastleigh in May 2013. In September 2016 the player signed for Maidstone United in the National League.|$|E
5|$|In 1271, Niccolò, Maffeo and Marco Polo {{embarked}} on their voyage to fulfil Kublai's request. They sailed to Acre, and then rode on camels to the Persian port of Hormuz. The Polos wanted to sail straight into China, but the ships {{there were not}} seaworthy, so they continued overland through the Silk Road, until reaching Kublai's summer palace in Shangdu, near present-day Zhangjiakou. In one instance during their trip, the Polos joined a caravan of travelling merchants whom they crossed paths with. Unfortunately, the party was soon attacked by bandits, who used {{the cover of a}} sandstorm to ambush them. The Polos managed to fight and escape through a nearby town, but many members of the caravan were killed or enslaved. <b>Three</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, the Polos were welcomed by Kublai into his palace. The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275. On reaching the Yuan court, the Polos presented the sacred oil from Jerusalem and the papal letters to their patron.|$|E
