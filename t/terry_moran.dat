More noteworthy, however, {{is the fact}} that the song was remixed by two {{well-known}} DJs Todd <b>Terry</b> and Tony <b>Moran.</b> These mixes gave the song a completely different sound, with an electronic house music backdrop layered in with the original recording. These mixes were released to dance clubs on promotional 12-inch singles, and the remixed [...] "Havana" [...] went to number one on Billboards Hot Dance Club Play chart in April 1997. To date, this is Kenny's only number one song on this chart. Both the original and dance versions received radio airplay in the United States as well.|$|R
5000|$|The Courtroom Television Network, or Court TV for short, was {{launched}} on July 1, 1991 at 6:00 am Eastern Time, and {{was available to}} three million subscribers. Its original anchors were Fred Graham, Cynthia McFadden, and <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran.</b> The network {{was born out of}} two competing projects to launch cable channels with live courtroom proceedings, the American Trial Network from Time Warner and American Lawyer Media, and In Court from Cablevision and NBC. Both projects were present at the National Cable Television Association in June 1990. Rather than trying to establish two competing networks, the projects were combined on December 14, 1990. Liberty Media would join the venture in 1991. The network's first logo consisted of a rectangle with the word [...] "COURT", and the letters [...] "TV" [...] below, with a line underneath.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Brill founded Court TV (now TruTV) and {{the network}} {{launched}} on July 1, 1991.

The network {{was born out of}} two competing projects to launch cable channels with live courtroom proceedings, the American Trial Network from Time Warner and American Lawyer Media and In Court from Cablevision and NBC. Both projects were combined and presented at the National Cable Television Association in June 1990. Liberty Media joined the venture in 1991. Court TV featured continuous live trial coverage, with analysis by anchors. The network came into its own during the Menendez brothers first trial and later the O.J. Simpson murder trial. In 1997, Brill resigned from the network.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2008, {{there was}} {{considerable}} media comment when {{it was revealed that}} Jeffery's successor-designate, Quentin Bryce, had decided that she would appoint Stephen Brady as her Official Secretary when she took office on 5 September. This meant that Hazell's job would be ending and, although he made no public comment, he was reported to be [...] "distraught" [...] when informed of the matter three weeks earlier by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran.</b> It was reported that Jeffery confronted Bryce about the matter when they met in Brisbane. However, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd stated that neither he nor his office played any part in Bryce's decision. At the same time, he defended Bryce's right to decide who her Official Secretary should be, and said that Hazell would be offered another position within the public service.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 2009, vice {{president}} of student affairs, Mark Hine, sent an e-mail {{to the president of}} Liberty University's College Democrats, Brian O'Nill Diaz, revoking the university's recognition of the club.

50|$|On November 28, 2005, Koppel was {{succeeded by}} a three-anchor team: Martin Bashir and Cynthia McFadden at Times Square Studios in New York City and <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran</b> in Washington, D.C.. Along {{with the new}} anchors, Nightline began airing live each night (outside of pre-taped story packages) and {{switched}} to a multi-topic format (similar to the format attempted during the short-lived 1983 expansion to an hour-long broadcast, although condensed to fit a half-hour timeslot) - that covers multiple stories in each broadcast. The conversion to a multi-topic format has received some criticism {{due to the fact}} that it is more difficult to focus on a story subject in depth when there is much less time devoted to it, and that more stories seen on the program seem to focus more on popular culture, rather than news events. However, ratings increased after the new format was implemented, even beating the Late Show with David Letterman for three consecutive weeks in August 2006 and again in 2008.|$|E
50|$|McFadden {{became an}} anchor of Primetime in 2004 and, having {{previously}} substituted for Ted Koppel on several occasions, an anchor of Nightline on November 28, 2005, along with Martin Bashir and <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran,</b> following the longtime anchor's final broadcast. Bashir left the program due to fallout from credibility problems from the disputed and controversial reports on singer Michael Jackson {{and was replaced}} by Bill Weir in 2010. The three tended to anchor in shifts, leading the show by themselves every third night. While Nightline was threatened with cancellation in 2002 under Koppel's long form journalism format, it saw a resurgence in its ratings and prominence after switching to more celebrity topics, pop culture and entertainment news, often competing for higher numbers with the Late Show with David Letterman. As anchor, McFadden conducted a number of significant interviews including ones with celebrities such as Clint Eastwood and Paul McCartney, past and present world leaders such as Pervez Musharraf and Tony Blair, and five with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.|$|E
50|$|Some former anchors of {{the weekend}} news {{broadcasts}} include Sam Donaldson (Sunday edition, 1979-1988), Kathleen Sullivan (Saturday edition, 1985-1987), Charles Gibson (Saturday edition, 1987-1988), Forrest Sawyer (Sunday edition, 1989-1993), Carole Simpson (Saturday edition, 1988-1993; Sunday edition, 1993-2003), Elizabeth Vargas (Saturday edition, 1997-2003; Sunday edition, 2003-2004), Jim Avila (Saturday edition, 2006-2007), <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran</b> (Saturday edition, 2004-2005), Bob Woodruff (Sunday edition, 2004-2005), Dan Harris (Sunday edition, 2006-2011) and David Muir (Saturday edition, 2007-2011; Saturday and Sunday editions, 2011-2014). Muir, who had taken over World News Saturday in 2007, took over the Sunday broadcast in 2011, ending the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions of the program, with ABC renaming both broadcasts as ABC World News with David Muir as a result. David Muir anchored the weekend program until {{he took over the}} weekday broadcast in September 2014. The program returned to using separate anchors for the weekend broadcasts afterward, with Cecilia Vega being named anchor of the Saturday broadcast and Tom Llamas named anchor of the Sunday edition in February 2015. After Vega was named senior White House correspondent, Llamas was named sole weekend anchor in January 2017, as the practice of using separate anchors for the Saturday and Sunday editions ended once again.|$|E
5000|$|... de Brouwer was {{previously}} the Associate Secretary in the Domestic Policy Group at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under the Rudd Government. In this position, de Brouwer provided departmental and cross-government policy {{advice to the}} Prime Minister on domestic policy and G20 matters and was also the senior official representing Australia’s interests in the G20. Dr de Brouwer {{played a key role}} in the development of Australia's $42 billion economic stimulus package. Former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran,</b> stated in his witness statement to the Home Insulation Royal Commission that de Brouwer was given primary responsibility for devising environmental initiatives and presenting them to Cabinet, including the Energy Efficient Homes Package that included the Home Insulation Program that resulted in the deaths of four insulation installers. de Brouwer also led the Australian delegation to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. [...] de Brouwer was appointed as Australia's G20 sherpa by Kevin Rudd. It was reported in Wikileaks cables that De Brouwer lamented to his contacts in the US Embassy that [...] "PM&C foreign policy staff have been run ragged answering the PM's (Rudd's) queries and supporting his interaction with foreign officials.|$|E
5000|$|In a radio {{interview}} with Alex Sloan on Canberra's ABC 666 on 9 February 2016, former Liberal Party Leader John Hewson {{said the government}} is [...] "cutting down the CSIRO’s capacity to monitor climate change" [...] despite the reality that [...] "there’s still more to be done". Why, he asked, would you [...] "be sending negative signals {{while at the same}} time you’re trying to send positive signals about innovation and a sensible response to change". The [...] "problem", he concluded is that [...] "Malcolm Turnbull did a deal with conservatives in the Party to stay with the Abbott climate change policies". This, he said, [...] "doesn’t make any sense in a world where we have to accelerate the response to climate change". On 21 March 2016, in an {{interview with}} the host of Radio National's Late Night Live, Phillip Adams, former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran</b> AC, said of the CSIRO's intention to cut 350 positions - including those associated with climate change research - [...] "I don't know what the CEO or the Board thought they were doing when they made such a big change like that, you might have to make adjustments over time but to do it just a few months out from an election and totally disrupt lots of good work that's being done by the CSIRO in change and other fields is odd, odd, very odd.

TMZ later obtained audio of the comment. [...] "You know, it was like, she's getting an award {{and what are you}} butting in? ...The young lady seems like a perfectly nice person, she's getting her award and what's he doing up there? He's a jackass," [...] said Obama. The [...] "off the air" [...] comment forced ABC, whose news anchor <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran</b> leaked the information, to issue an apology after the Internet quickly [...] "became abuzz over the stunning remark". Additionally, West was criticized by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter for the outburst. The day following his outburst, West posted a second apology on his blog; he appeared on The Jay Leno Show later that night, where he delivered another apology to Swift which was met with cheers from the crowd. [...] "Dealing with the fact that I hurt someone or took anything away, you know, from a talented artist - or from anyone - because I only wanted to help people," [...] he said. [...] "...My entire life, I've only wanted to do and give something that I felt was right and I immediately knew in this situation that it was wrong." [...] He became emotional, seemingly tearing up, when questioned by Leno about what his late mother would have thought of the incident.|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the National Commission of Audit and a bleak Federal Budget for public services, CPD {{releases}} the compiled and updated False economies series, including the new final instalment Good, better, best (plus an excellent foreword by <b>Terry</b> <b>Moran</b> AC and original cartoons by Fiona Katauskas). Early instalments in the series have clarified the full meaning of ‘efficiency’, highlighted examples of the effects of cuts applied {{as a result of the}} term’s misuse, and revealed that the Australian Public Service (APS) is highly efficient – ranking second behind Switzerland among OECD countries. Updated editions of these instalments are included in the full compilation. Overall, the False economies series concludes that the way we discuss public service efficiency is damaging the country. The term’s misuse justifies policy approaches that can actually drive inefficiency and waste, and distracts us from good ideas for genuine efficiency improvements. New material draws on interviews with public sector experts to identify innovation and professional accountability as two keys to greater efficiency. Good, better, best finds that the National Commission of Audit and Federal Budget adopted a narrow approach to questions of efficiency. In striving for ‘smaller and more rational government’, the value delivered by some affected agencies is largely overlooked to deliver ‘leaner business-like ways of operating’. An Efficiency Dividend of 2. 5 % will compound this, resulting in across-the-board cuts to services ‘regardless of their utility’. The upshot is that the Federal Government is withdrawing from (or reducing) a range of services, threatening the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Public Service at a time of increasing uncertainty. The current budget estimates the loss of 16, 500 public service jobs in the next two years – a similar scale of cuts to those of the early Howard Government, which were followed by rapid staff increases within a few years. Such fluctuations threaten allocative and dynamic efficiency, stripping out skills and eroding competencies in key areas. The budget assumes smaller government is necessarily more efficient. It lacks a serious examination of how best to achieve aims with minimal resources, and instead simply attempts to minimise resources.  – Chris Stone Public sector innovation faces different constraints to those in the private sector, often operating in a risk-averse environment with a lack of investment. The report recommends cost-effective measures to support innovation, including cross-agency innovation teams, incentive schemes and a dedicated innovation fund. Public service goals are more complex than the private sector profit drive, and this special context requires an emphasis on professional accountability. The report recommends the APS should: focus on organisational outcomes, with clearly defined priorities informed by a national planning process; improve accountability by closer engagement with service users and front-line public servants; reinforce efforts to increase trust between management and staff; and work for more constructive relationships between ministers and public servants...|$|E
