Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E

25|$|Stahlschmidt slowly built a {{reputation}} as a combat leader over the summer, 1942. On 13 June he claimed a Hurricane of No. 213 Squadron RAF while comrade Friedrich Körner registered his first victories. The following day near Kambut he claimed a P-40 of 5 Squadron SAAF. The German Africa Corps pursued the British into Egypt and Rommel attempted to destroy the bulk of the British Army at Mersa Matruh. In the ensuing Battle of Mersa Matruh, Rommel depleted British forces but failed to destroy them. On <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> intensive air combat Stahlschmidt downed four Desert Air Force aircraft over the battlefield. The claims were his 14th–17th aerial victories. Stahlschmidt's close friend Marseille passed the 100-mark on 18 June 1942 and departed for two months leave.|$|E

Although {{he is often}} {{credited}} with shooting the drum-dance sequence, Ramnoth left the studio in August 1947 (before the scene was conceived). Director Singeetham Srinivasa Rao told film critic Baradwaj Rangan that he disliked Chandralekha {{when he first saw}} it and recognised it as a classic only after 25 years, [...] "a fact that the audiences realised in just two minutes." [...] Film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan told The Times of India, [...] "When you talk of black-and-white films, you cannot resist mentioning the 1948 epic Chandralekha ... That film's grandeur, be it in the sets, costumes, songs, dances and the fight sequences, still remains a benchmark even <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> colour and 3D films." [...] In April 2012, Rediff included the film on its [...] "A to Z of Tamil Cinema" [...] list and said that Chandralekha [...] "boasted an ensemble cast, great production values and a story that ensured it became a blockbuster all over India, the first of its kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurrle's {{first foray}} into the film {{industry}} was on the 1916 film, Her Great Price, directed by Edwin Carewe. He later collaborated with Carewe {{on a number of}} pictures during the 1920s. He began his career working for Metro Pictures, where he stayed at until 1921. Metro was one of the film companies which merged in 1924 to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The quality of Kurrle's work was noticed even early in his career. His filming of 1919's Lion's Den was called [...] "spectacular". Kurrle's work the following year on The Right of Way was described by some as [...] "... remarkable even in <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> almost perfect cinematography." [...] By 1921, Kurrle was already a member of the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC). [...] Early that year, he followed Carewe and left Metro to become a freelance cinematographer. Fifteen of the twenty-four films Kurrle worked on during 1921-27 were directed by Carewe. In 1922, while filming a Carewe picture, I Am the Law, Kurrle successfully tested a new high-speed film from Eastman. The new film allowed interior filming with less lighting, reducing both equipment and staffing costs.|$|E
