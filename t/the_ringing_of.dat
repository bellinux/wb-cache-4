5|$|On 13 June 1940 <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> {{church bells}} was banned; {{henceforth}} {{they would only}} be rung by the military or the police to warn that an invasion—generally meaning by parachutists—was in progress.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> multisymmetric {{functions}} over a commutative ring is isomorphic to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> generated by <b>the</b> coefficients of the {{characteristic polynomial of}} polynomials in commuting generic matrices. As a consequence we give a surjection from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> invariants of several matrices to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> multisymmetric functions generalizing a classical result of H. Weyl and F. Junker. We also find a surjection from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> invariants over <b>the</b> commuting scheme to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> multisymmetric functions. This surjection is an isomophism over a characteristic zero field and induces an isomorphism {{at the level of}} reduced structures over an infinite field of positive characteristic. ...|$|R
5|$|Details of the {{assassination}} attempt were allegedly known by the principal Jesuit of England, Father Henry Garnet. Although {{he was convicted of}} treason and sentenced to death, doubt has been cast on how much he really knew of the plot. As its existence was revealed to him through confession, Garnet was prevented from informing the authorities by the absolute confidentiality of the confessional. Although anti-Catholic legislation was introduced soon after the plot's discovery, many important and loyal Catholics retained high office during King James I's reign. The thwarting of the Gunpowder Plot was commemorated for many years afterwards by special sermons and other public events such as <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> church bells, which have evolved into the Bonfire Night of today.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Gifu {{absorbed the}} former post town of Kanō, greatly {{increasing}} its land area. Kanō had many traditional industries, which helped improve Gifu's overall industrial strength. With the neighboring city of Kakamigahara {{serving as an}} aeronautics center for Japan, Gifu was a large industrial center during World War II, including a downtown manufacturing sector. As a result, Gifu {{was the target of}} heavy firebombing by the United States Army Air Forces, culminating in the Gifu Air Raid of July 9, 1945, which resulted in 1,383 casualties (863 dead, 520 injured) and 20,426 buildings affected. Gifu commemorates these events each year on July 9, with <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the Peace Bell at each temple within the city. Its sister cities also take part in these events.|$|E
5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of the Junta and that the Junta itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against the Junta.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the Noetherian properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators of an affine semigroup algebra. First {{we show that}} it is always right Noetherian. Next we give a condition, based on the data {{of the difference between}} the semigroup and its scored closure, for <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being anti-isomorphic to another <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators. Using this, we prove that <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators is left Noetherian if the condition is satisfied. Moreover we give some other conditions for <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being left Noetherian. Finally we conjecture necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> differential operators being left Noetherian...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> invariants of binary septics is {{anomalous}} and {{has caused}} several published errors. Cayley claimed incorrectly that <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> invariants is not finitely generated. [...] gave lower bounds of 26 and 124 {{for the number}} <b>of</b> generators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> invariants and <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> covariants and observed that an unproved [...] "fundamental postulate" [...] would imply that equality holds. However [...] showed that Sylvester's numbers are not equal to the numbers of generators, which are 30 for <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> invariants and at least 130 for <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> covariants, so Sylvester's fundamental postulate is wrong. [...] and [...] showed that the algebra of invariants of a degree 7 form is generated by a set with 1 invariant of degree 4, 3 of degree 8, 6 of degree 12, 4 of degree 14, 2 of degree 16, 9 of degree 18, and one {{of each of the}} degrees 20, 22, 26, 30. [...] gives 147 generators for <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> covariants.|$|R
5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to warn of {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Saladin's reign as sultan in Egypt, upon the encouragement of his adviser, Qadi al-Fadil, Christians were prohibited from employment in the fiscal administration, but various Ayyubid emirs continued to allow Christians to serve in their posts. A number of other regulations were imposed, including the bans on alcohol consumption, religious processions, and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> church bells. Conversion of formerly high-ranking Christians and their families to Islam took place throughout the early period of Ayyubid rule. According to historian Yaakov Lev, the persecution of non-Muslims had some permanent effects on them, but nonetheless, the effects were local and contained. To manage Mediterranean trade, the Ayyubids permitted Europeans—mainly Italians, but also French and Catalans—to settle in Alexandria in large numbers. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the Fifth Crusade, 3,000 merchants from the area were arrested or expelled.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{nations were}} {{entered in the}} tandem competition, {{and in the first}} round, they were drawn with Germany and South Africa, who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom Shardelow and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. The Australians made their move too early and led at <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the bell {{at the start of the}} last lap, but they were {{overhauled}} well before the line as they faded in the final straight. Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day. The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance, but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish. This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated, however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle, resulting in a heavy pile-up. Neither teams finished the race, but the Soviets were hospitalised. The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the losers in the previous repechages to qualify. This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve.|$|E

5|$|The Lincoln-Liberty Building, {{completed}} in 1932, {{was intended to}} partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and <b>the</b> <b>ringing</b> <b>of</b> the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building {{was a sign of}} the store's faith that the economy would improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2,000,000 worth of merchandise and was the largest store {{of its kind in the}} world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was ready to take the store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street.|$|E
