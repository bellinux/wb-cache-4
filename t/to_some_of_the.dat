5|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century {{to the start of the}} Second World War, there were few changes in Altrincham. Although the town was witness <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe's raids on the Manchester area, it emerged from the war {{relatively}} unscathed, and as with the rest of Britain, experienced an economic boom. This manifested itself in the construction of new housing and the 1960s rebuilding of the town centre. However, during the 1970s employment at Broadheath declined by nearly 40per cent.|$|E

Because most of the German garrisons surrendered peacefully, the Channel Islands are host <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best-preserved Atlantic Wall sites.|$|E
