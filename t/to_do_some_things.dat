As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him that she needs <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, {{in addition to the}} other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Annie and Dixon {{are going}} through rough times after their parents' divorce and attempt to keep the family close. Debbie deals {{with the realities of}} being a newly single mother. Annie has spent the summer on house arrest (in {{addition}} to being on probation and having a suspended license) after confessing to her hit-and-run. Annie and Liam have feelings for each other but think it best to put it away so it doesn't interfere with their relationships with others. Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who turns out to be Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie {{have a lot in common}} and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his sexuality, after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls to be in his porn films. Adrianna is oblivious to his problems, causing him and Silver to become closer.|$|E

[...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>things</b> you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E

How strange this notion of duty which I have, and which the other animals have not; this notion of its being right <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> and wrong to do others!

6000|$|On my father's {{side the}} matter is more complex. The history of the [...] family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my [...] own, by Sir William Fraser, the highest living authority.[2] He has [...] carried us up to a rather remote period, I think before Elizabeth, [...] but {{has not yet been}} able to connect us with the {{earliest}} known [...] holders of the name, which with the aid of charter-chests he hopes [...] <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>things</b> are plain and not without interest. They were a [...] race of borderers. There is still an old Gledstanes or Gladstone [...] castle. They formed a family in Sweden in the seventeenth century. [...] The explanation of this may have been that, when the union of the [...] crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service [...] like Sir Dugald Dalgetty under Gustavus Adolphus, and in this case [...] passed from service to settlement. I have never heard of them in [...] Scotland until after the Restoration, otherwise than as persons of [...] family. At that period there are traces of their having been fined [...] by public authority, but not for any ordinary criminal offence. [...] From this time forward I find no trace of their gentility. During [...] the eighteenth century they are, I think, principally traced by a [...] line of maltsters (no doubt a small business then) in Lanarkshire. [...] Their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of Biggar. [...] I remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of [...] that branch, either in 1820 or some years earlier, who was a small [...] watchmaker in that town. He was of the same generation as my [...] father, but came, I understood, from a senior brother of the [...] family. I do not know whether his line is extinct. There also seem [...] to be some stray Gladstones who are found at Yarmouth and in [...] Yorkshire.[3] ...|$|E

60|$|Let {{us think}} seriously this {{afternoon}} of one word; the word {{which is the}} key-note of this psalm. A very short word; for in our language there is but one letter in it. A very common word; for we are using it all day long when we are awake, and even at night in our dreams; and yet a very wonderful word, for though we know well whom it means, yet what it means we do not know, and cannot understand, no, nor can the wisest philosopher who ever lived; and a most important word too; for we cannot get rid of it, we cannot help thinking of it, cannot help saying it all our life long from childhood to the grave. After death, too, we shall probably be saying that word to ourselves, each of us, for ever and ever. If the whole universe, sun, moon, and stars, and all that we ever thought of, or can think of, were destroyed and became nothing, that word would probably be left; {{and we should be}} left alone with it; and on what we meant by that little word would depend our everlasting happiness or misery. And what is this wonderful little word? What but the word I? Each one of us says I--I think, I know, I feel, I ought, I ought not, I did that, and cannot undo it: and why? Because we are not things, nor mere animals, but persons, living souls, though our bodies are like the bodies of animals, only more perfect, that they may be fit dwelling-places for more perfect souls. The animals, as far as we know, do not think of themselves each as I. Little children do not at first. They call themselves by names by which they hear others call them: not in the first but in the third person. After a while there grows up in them the wonderful thought that they are persons, different from any other person round them, and they begin to say--I want this, I like that. I trust that I shall not seem to you as one who dreams when I say that I believe that is a revelation from God to each child, and just what makes the difference between him and an animal; that God teaches each child to say I; to know {{that it is not a}} mere thing, but a person, a living soul, with a will of its own, and a duty of its own; responsible for itself; which ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>some</b> <b>things,</b> and ought not to do other things. And what a solemn and awful revelation that is, we shall see more clearly, the more we think of it.|$|E
