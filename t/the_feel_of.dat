5|$|Avadhi, {{which is}} a dialect of Hindi, is {{primarily}} from a region in Uttar Pradesh. It was chosen to give <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the language spoken during that era. However, the language was diluted, and modern viewers can understand it. The dialogues, which were a combination of three dialects (Avadhi, Bhojpuri and Braj Bhasha) were penned by Hindi writer K. P. Saxena.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design a new house and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton {{came up with an}} asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> a picturesque castle.|$|E
5|$|Paramount {{turned down}} several {{proposals}} in the mid-2000s {{to restart the}} franchise. These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer, Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, and Trek actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner. The studio also turned down an animated web series. Instead, Paramount hired a new creative team to reinvigorate the franchise in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and Lost producer, J. J. Abrams, had the freedom to reinvent <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> Trek.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{script was}} written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996 and brought to the {{attention}} of Bayona in 2004. Bayona asked his long-time friend, director Guillermo del Toro, to help produce the film and to double its budget and filming time. Bayona wanted the film to capture <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> 1970s Spanish cinema; he cast Geraldine Chaplin and Belén Rueda, who were later praised for their roles in the film.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the seventh and eighth episodes of the fourth series. It would have seen Sarah Jane being kidnapped and replaced by an identical look-alike. It was ultimately replaced by The Empty Planet as the production team was concerned it had too much of <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the 1970s Gerry Anderson science-fiction series, UFO.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> a small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end}} of the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E

5|$|From 21 April 2001, Live & Kicking began {{broadcasting}} from BBC Scotland in Glasgow and saw Farley, Cawood and Deley {{joined by}} Heather Suttie who replaced Hill. The set {{remained the same}} after having been transported up to Glasgow from London, however a new seating area was added, consisting of pouffes and beanbags. <b>The</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The first hour became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two in order to keep <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Nidhogg is a side-scrolling two-player {{fighting}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Messhof. Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment. The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center's annual multiplayer show, and was revised and demoed at private events {{over the next four}} years before its final release. It won Indiecade 2013's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival's Nuovo award. It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13, 2014, and later ported to OS X, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. Critics praised <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the gameplay and its balance, but considered its single-player mode unsatisfying. Messhof released a sequel in 2017 with a higher resolution art style and additional weapons and arenas.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> a castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with the comfortable interior of a house.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist developments that attempt to recreate <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are {{the focal point of the}} neighborhood.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the book led to offers of work from The Sunday Times—for which she was paid an advance of 60 guineas—Go, a travel {{magazine}} owned by the newspaper, and Wine and Food, {{the journal of the}} Wine and Food Society. In August 1950 David and her husband went on their final holiday together with the money from the new contracts, although they had trouble with the car they were using for touring and the holiday was unsuccessful. On her return she invited Felicité, her youngest sister, to move into the top flat in her house. David was a reluctant and unskilful typist—she preferred <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> writing with a pen—and in exchange for a low rent, Felicité expertly typed her articles and books, and later acted as her principal researcher.|$|E
5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} game with updated graphics and {{sounds in the}} demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team {{did not intend to}} create a complete remake of the original game since they would not have the necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|With their {{timeframe}} extended, {{the development}} team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and local network. The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} fit on the previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is {{an assassin}} {{sent by the}} Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} {{fell in love with}} her. While out one day, a fight broke out at the inn and Chie was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishirō Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering <b>the</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Feeling</b> <b>of</b> Risk: New Perspectives on Risk Perception by Paul Slovic {{addresses}} the increasingly popular topic of risk perception {{and is the}} successor to the acclaimed The Perception <b>of</b> Risk (2000). <b>The</b> <b>Feeling</b> <b>of</b> Risk is undoubtedly a source of in-depth understanding {{of the significance of}} feelings and is a substantive contribution to risk perception research. It aims at renewing its predecessor’s intentions of communicating the latest research in the field and presents new insights on the role of feelings in risk behaviour, perception and decision making...|$|R
