The theatre missile defence would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising early warning system sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are deeply divided about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} law rules for <b>contracts</b> <b>are</b> more {{complicated}} than the law affecting other obligations because they depend on the express or implied intentions of the parties and their personal circumstances.

But, if <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> <b>was</b> made electronically, where <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> <b>was</b> actually made must first be decided either by the lex fori or the putative proper law depending on the forum rules.
