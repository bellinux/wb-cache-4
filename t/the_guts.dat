5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gut</b> is {{surrounded}} by enterochromaffin cells, which release serotonin in response to food in the lumen. This makes <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> contract around <b>the</b> food. Platelets in the veins draining <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> collect excess serotonin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gut</b> flora is <b>the</b> complex {{community}} of microorganisms {{that live in}} the digestive tracts of humans and other animals, as well as insects. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> metagenome is <b>the</b> aggregate of all <b>the</b> genomes of <b>gut</b> microbiota. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> is one niche that human microbiota inhabit.|$|R
2500|$|Each {{segment of}} <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> is further {{specified}} and {{gives rise to}} specific gut and gut-related structures in later development. Components derived from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> proper, including <b>the</b> stomach and colon, develop as swellings or dilatations [...] in the cells of <b>the</b> primitive <b>gut.</b> In contrast, gut-related derivatives — that is, those structures that derive from <b>the</b> primitive <b>gut</b> but {{are not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> proper, in general develop as out-pouchings of <b>the</b> primitive <b>gut.</b> <b>The</b> blood vessels supplying these structures remain constant throughout development.|$|R
5|$|The lack of circulatory and {{respiratory}} organs limits platyhelminths to {{sizes and shapes}} that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave {{all parts of the}}ir bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. <b>The</b> <b>guts</b> of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E

40|$|SummaryArthopods such as Ixodes scapularis ticks {{serve as}} vectors for many human pathogens. <b>The</b> {{arthropod}} <b>gut</b> presents a pivotal microbial entry point and determines pathogen colonization and survival. We show that <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> microbiota of I.  scapularis, a major vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, influence spirochete colonization of ticks. Perturbing <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> microbiota of larval ticks reduced Borrelia colonization, and dysbiosed larvae displayed decreased {{expression of the}} transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Diminished STAT expression corresponded to lower expression of peritrophin, a key glycoprotein scaffold of the glycan-rich mucus-like peritrophic matrix (PM) that separates <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> lumen from <b>the</b> epithelium.

40|$|We {{devised a}} set-up in which microsensors {{can be used}} for characterising <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> {{microenvironment}} of aquatic macrofauna. In a small flow cell, we measured microscale gradients through dissected guts (O₂, pH, redox potential [E h]), in the haemolymph (O₂), and towards the body surface (O₂) of Chironomus plumosus larvae. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> microenvironment was compared with the chemical conditions in the lake sediment in which the animals reside and feed. When <b>the</b> dissected <b>guts</b> were incubated at the same nominal O₂ concentration as in haemolymph, <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> content was completely anoxic and had pH and E h values slightly lower than in the ambient sediment. When <b>the</b> dissected <b>guts</b> were artificially oxygenated, the volumetric O₂-consumption rates of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> content were at least 10 x higher than in the sediment. Using these potential O₂-consumption rates in a cylindrical diffusion-reaction model, it was predicted that diffusion of O₂ from the haemolymph to <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> could not oxygenate <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> content under in vivo conditions. Additionally, the potential O₂-consumption rates were so high that the intake of dissolved O₂ along with feeding could be ruled out to oxygenate <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> content.

40|$|Abstract Background Recently {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest and appreciation for <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> as both a viral reservoir as well as an important host-pathogen interface in human immunodefiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. <b>The</b> <b>gut</b> associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ infected by HIV- 1. In this study we examined if different HIV- 1 quasispecies are found in different parts of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> of HIV- 1 infected individuals. Results Gut biopsies (esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colorectum) were obtained from eight HIV- 1 infected preHAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients. HIV- 1 Nef and Reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding sequences were obtained through nested PCR amplification from DNA isolated from <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> biopsy tissues. <b>The</b> PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced. The resulting sequences were subjected to various phylogenetic analyses. Expression of the nef gene and viral RNA in <b>the</b> different <b>gut</b> tissues was determined using real-time RT-PCR.

40|$|International audienceIn complex life cycles, larval helminths {{typically}} {{migrate from}} <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> to exploit <b>the</b> tissues of their intermediate hosts.

Our models include the survival costs of migration between sites, and maximise fitness (= expected lifetime number of eggs produced by a given helminth propagule) in seeking the optimal strategy (host gut versus host tissue exploitation) under different growth, mortality, transmission and reproductive rates in <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and tissues (i. e. sites away from <b>the</b> <b>gut).</b> We consider <b>the</b> relative merits of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> and tissues, and conclude that (i) growth rates are likely to be higher in the tissues, (ii) mortality rates possibly higher in <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> (despite <b>the</b> immunological inertness of <b>the</b> <b>gut</b> lumen), and (iii) that there are very high benefits to egg release in <b>the</b> <b>gut.</b> <b>The</b> models show that these growth and mortality relativities would account for the common life history pattern of avoidance of <b>the</b> intermediate host's <b>gut</b> because <b>the</b> tissues offer a higher growth rate/mortality rate ratio (discounted by the costs of migration), and make a number of testable predictions.
