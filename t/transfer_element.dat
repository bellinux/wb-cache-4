40|$|In {{the passive}} {{residual}} heat removal system of a molten salt reactor, {{one of the}} residual heat removal methods {{is to use the}} thimble-type heat transfer elements of the drain salt tank to remove the residual heat of fuel salts. An experimental loop is designed and built with a single heat <b>transfer</b> <b>element</b> to analyze the heat transfer and flow characteristics. In this research, the influence of the size of a three-layer thimble-type heat <b>transfer</b> <b>element</b> on the heat transfer rate is analyzed. Two methods are used to obtain the heat transfer rate, and a difference of results between methods is approximately 5 %. The gas gap width between the thimble and the bayonet has a large effect on the heat transfer rate. As the gas gap width increases from 1. 0  mm to 11. 0  mm, the heat transfer rate decreases from 5. 2  kW to 1. 6  kW. In addition, a natural circulation startup process is described in this paper. Finally, flashing natural circulation instability has been observed in this thimble-type heat <b>transfer</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E

40|$|Investigations of antibiotic-resistance gene <b>transfer</b> <b>elements</b> in Bacteroides {{species have}} {{generated}} some {{new insights into}} how bacteria transfer resistance genes and what environmental conditions foster gene transfer. Integrated gene <b>transfer</b> <b>elements,</b> called conjugative transposons, appear {{to be responsible for}} much of the transfer of resistance genes among Bacteroides species. Conjugative transposons not only transfer themselves but also mobilize coresident plasmids and excise and mobilize unlinked integrated elements. Less is known about resistance gene <b>transfer</b> <b>elements</b> of the gram-positive anaerobes, but there are some indications that similar elements may be found in them as well. An unusual feature of the Bacteroides conjugative transposons is that transfer of many of them is stimulated considerably by low concentrations of antibiotics. Thus, antibiotics not only select for resistant strains but also can stimulate transfer of the resistance gene in the first place. This finding raises questions about whether use of low-dose tetracycline therapy may have a greater effect on the resident microftora than had been previously thought. Finally, investigations of resis-tance genes in Bacteroides species and other genera of bacteria have begun to provide evidence that the resident microftora of the human body does indeed act as a reservoir for resistance genes, which may be acquired from and passed on to transient colonizers of the site...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{rotation}} angle measurement, one novel type of miniaturization fiber Bragg grating (FBG) rotation angle sensor with high measurement precision and temperature self-compensation is proposed and studied in this paper. The FBG rotation angle sensor mainly contains two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), triangular cantilever beam, and rotation angle <b>transfer</b> <b>element.</b> In theory, the proposed sensor can achieve temperature self-compensation by complementation of the two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), {{and it has a}} boundless angel measurement range with 2 π rad period duo to the function of the rotation angle <b>transfer</b> <b>element.</b> Based on introducing the joint working processes, the theory calculation model of the FBG rotation angel sensor is established, and the calibration experiment on one prototype is also carried out to obtain its measurement performance. After experimental data analyses, the measurement precision of the FBG rotation angle sensor prototype is 0.2 ° with excellent linearity, and the temperature sensitivities of FBG 1 and FBG 2 are 10 pm/℃ and 10.1 pm/℃, correspondingly. All these experimental results confirm that the FBG rotation angle sensor can achieve large-range angle measurement with high precision and temperature self-compensation.|$|E

It focuses on the enforcement of prop-erty rights on land under private titling and the two existing public titling systems, recording and registration. When the reduction in likelihood of eviction compensates the higher cost of registration, it is more efficient to introduce a registration system rather than a record-ing system. The development of private ‘title assurance ’ improves the standing of recording as compared to registration. This improvement depends, however, on the efficiency of the assurance technology and, also, on corrective taxation that is needed to avoiding that individual optimization, which disregards the <b>transfer</b> <b>element</b> in eviction, drives consumption of assurance services much above its socially optimal level...|$|E

We were able to separate a 14. 6 -kilobase self-transmissible Clnr plasmid, pBFTM 10, from the other plasmids of TMP 10 in a tetracycline-sensitive recipient strain, B. fragilis TM 4000. All Clnr transconjugants acquired an unaltered pBFTM 10 and became plasmid donor strains. Transfer is proposed to occur by conjugation since it required to cell-to-cell contact of filter matings and was insensitive to DNase, but sensitive to chloroform treatment of donor cells. The efficiency of transfer of pBFTM 10 in a Tets background (TM 4003) was not affected by pretreatment of donor cells with clindamycin.

It captured temperature data from 16 sensors positioned at the interface between the phantom model and a silicone liner and used their average for comparison with a defined set temperature to select required heating or cooling functions for thermal equilibrium. A thin layer of Aluminum was used to transfer temperature between thermal pump and different sites around the phantom model.
