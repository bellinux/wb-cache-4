It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E

5|$|One of Shelby's chief {{concerns}} was securing {{federal aid}} <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the frontier.

With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.|$|E
