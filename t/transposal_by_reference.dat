5000|$|Parameter modes are {{a form of}} denotational semantics, {{stating the}} programmer's intent and {{allowing}} compilers to catch errors and apply optimizations - they do not necessarily imply operational semantics (how the parameter passing actually occurs). Notably, while input parameters can be implemented by call by value, and output and input/output parameters <b>by</b> call <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> - {{and this is a}} straightforward way to implement these modes in languages without built-in support - this is not always how they are implemented. This distinction is discussed in detail in the Ada '83 Rationale, which emphasizes that the parameter mode is abstracted from which parameter passing mechanism (<b>by</b> <b>reference</b> or <b>by</b> copy) is actually implemented. For instance, while in C# input parameters (default, no keyword) are passed by value, and output and input/output parameters ( [...] and [...] ) are passed <b>by</b> <b>reference,</b> in PL/SQL input parameters (...) are passed <b>by</b> <b>reference,</b> and output and input/output parameters ( [...] and [...] ) are by default passed by value and the result copied back, but can be passed <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> <b>by</b> using the [...] compiler hint.|$|R

50|$|Call <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> (also {{referred}} to as pass <b>by</b> <b>reference)</b> is an evaluation strategy where a function receives an implicit reference to a variable used as argument, rather than a copy of its value.This typically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the variable used as argument—something that will be seen by its caller. Call <b>by</b> <b>reference</b> can therefore be used to provide an additional channel of communication between the called function and the calling function. A call-by-reference language {{makes it more difficult}} for a programmer to track the effects of a function call, and may introduce subtle bugs.|$|R

40|$|Objective – This study {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the related search functions in Web of Science and Scopus. Web of Science has one related search function (searching <b>by</b> <b>references)</b> whereas Scopus has three related search functions (searching <b>by</b> <b>references,</b> authors, or keywords). Methods – Thirty queries were searched in both Web of Science and Scopus. For each query, the most relevant document was retrieved and its first thirty related documents were assessed for relevancy to the original query. Results for both databases were compared using the median values of precision. For Scopus the three different methods of relevance were compared using median precision values. Results – The median precision value for the related documents retrieved from Web of Science was 0. 63, while the median for those retrieved from Scopus using the related <b>by</b> <b>references</b> function was 0. 62. A Wilcoxon test showed {{no significant difference in the}} two medians. In the comparison of the three related functions in Scopus, the median precision values were 0. 62, 0. 42, and 0. 43 for the related search functions <b>by</b> <b>references,</b> authors, and keywords respectively. A Friedman’s test showed that the median precision value for relatedness <b>by</b> <b>references</b> was significantly higher than the median vales for the other two related functions. In Scopus, {{the effectiveness of}} the related search function using all keywords was not as effective when compared to the effectiveness using select keywords. The median precision value with select keywords was 0. 17. Conclusions – The related search functions <b>by</b> <b>references</b> for both Web of Science and Scopus were moderately effective in retrieving additional relevant documents on a given topic, and there was no significant difference in their performance. When comparing the three methods available in Scopus, the related search function <b>by</b> <b>references</b> was found to be more effective than the system’s related functions by authors and keywords...|$|R
