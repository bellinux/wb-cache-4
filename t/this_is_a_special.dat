5|$|Typically, such {{models are}} based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, {{physicists}} postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> kind of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{groups of}} a topological space X {{are related to}} its first singular homology group, because a loop is also a singular 1-cycle. Mapping the homotopy class of each loop at a base point x0 to the homology class of the loop gives a homomorphism from the fundamental group π1(X,x0) to the homology group H1(X). If X is path-connected, then this homomorphism is surjective and its kernel is the commutator subgroup of π1(X,x0), and H1(X) is therefore isomorphic to the abelianization of π1(X,x0). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> case of the Hurewicz theorem of algebraic topology.|$|E
25|$|On a {{complete}} curved surface any two points can {{be joined by}} a geodesic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> case of the Hopf-Rinow theorem, which also applies in higher dimensions. The completeness assumption is automatically fulfilled for a surface which is embedded as a closed subset of Euclidean space. However, it is no longer fulfilled if, for example, we remove an isolated point from a surface. For example, the complement of the origin in the Euclidean plane {{is an example of a}} non-complete surface; in this example two points which are diametrically opposite across the origin cannot {{be joined by a}} geodesic without leaving the punctured plane).|$|E
25|$|Every {{countable}} limit ordinal requires {{replacement for}} its construction analogously to ω·2. Larger ordinals rely on replacement less directly. For example, ω1, the first uncountable ordinal, {{can be constructed}} as follows– the set of countable well orders exists as a subset of P(N×N) by separation and powerset (a relation on A is a subset of A×A, and so {{an element of the}} power set P(A×A). A set of relations is thus a subset of P(A×A)). Replace each well-ordered set with its ordinal. This is the set of countable ordinals ω1, which can itself be shown to be uncountable. The construction uses replacement twice; once to ensure an ordinal assignment for each well ordered set and again to replace well ordered sets by their ordinals. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> case of the result of Hartogs number, and the general case can be proved similarly.|$|E
