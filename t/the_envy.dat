He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, in {{its most}} {{significant}} schism, at least 250 members left the Church. Tensions began to build after Joaquín's birthday, when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday. This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members, including some pastors. Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which Joaquín was accused of having enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the faithful. Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members of La Luz del Mundo of committing immoralities with young women. Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission. Members of La Luz del Mundo attribute this episode to <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> and ambition of the dissidents, who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor (The Good Shepherd) under the leadership of José María González, with doctrines and practices similar to those of La Luz del Mundo. The leader is considered a prophet of God. As of 2010, El Buen Pastor Church has a membership of 17,700 in Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Envy is {{a complex}} emotion that {{influences}} the behavior of envious and envied individuals. Because envy can imply ill will, discontent or dislike of <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> individual who possesses something that the envious individual desires, or aspiration to emulate <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> position, it can lead the envious individual to undertake costly efforts to reduce the gap between <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> situation and his own situation. The envious individual can seek either to damage or match the situation enjoyed by <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> individual. In return, <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> individual can adopt either envy-appeasing strategies or envy-arousing strategies. We argue that these costly envy-related behaviors impede or stimulate economic development. behavioral economics, development, envy, institutions,...|$|R
40|$|Envy {{functions}} in resource competition {{situations in which}} a competitor out-competes oneself in a fitness relevant domain (Hill & Buss, 2006, 2008). Research {{suggests that there are}} two types of envy, a hostile version, aimed at depriving <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person of his or her advantage, and a benign version, aimed at gaining an advantage for oneself (Parrott, 1991; van de Ven, Zeelenberg, & Pieters, 2009). Three predictions were derived from the hypothesis that <b>the</b> selection of <b>envy</b> type is functional, taking into account the costs and benefits of a benign versus a hostile response: 1) Hostile envy was expected to be more likely when the advantage can’t be acquired without taking it from <b>the</b> <b>envied.</b> 2) Benign envy was expected to be more likely when the relationship with <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person is highly valuable to <b>the</b> <b>envier.</b> 3) Benign envy was expected to be more likely when the social environment favors <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person. Additionally, <b>the</b> emotions experienced as part of envy were proposed to mediate the relationships between elements of the situation and responses to envy. Using a daily diary method, participants described their everyday experiences of envy, which were categorized as benign or hostile based on taxometric and latent class analyses. Prediction 1 was fully supported and prediction 2 was largely supported. Prediction 3 was not supported; instead participants’ beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person’s deservingness directly affected envy type. Mediation analyses supported the proposal that emotions mediate the relationships between situations and responses. The degree to which <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person’s possession of the advantage makes it harder for <b>the</b> <b>envier</b> to get emerged as an important factor in how one responds to hostile envy.

5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance that had been <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> {{of the world in}} its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

40|$|Envy {{stems from}} a {{frustrating}} upward comparison and leads to diverse affective, cognitive, and behavioral changes aimed at leveling the status difference between <b>the</b> <b>envier</b> and <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person. Benign envy increases {{efforts to improve the}} envier's status whereas malicious envy increases efforts to harm <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person's position. Still, <b>the</b> elicitation of <b>envy</b> is poorly understood. I propose a model for <b>the</b> elicitation of <b>envy</b> in which appraisals of personal control over reaching <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person's status-yielding standard and deservingness of <b>the</b> advantage coordinate <b>envy's</b> diverse components—a conceptualization of benign and malicious envy as a social-functional emotion syndromes. Dispositional and situational determinants that affect the appraisal dimensions should therefore elicit either benign or malicious envy. Chapter 2 demonstrates that different forms of achievement motivation modulate envy, which is in line with the notion that they are theoretically linked to appraisals of personal control. Hope for success relates to dispositional benign <b>envy,</b> while <b>the</b> latter correlates with increased performance in long-distance runners. In contrast, fear of failure relates to dispositional malicious <b>envy,</b> while <b>the</b> latter is associated with the avoidance of a time goal. Chapter 3 demonstrates that superior individuals' pride displays modulate envy by conveying affective and inferential information to observers, which is in line with the notion that they are theoretically linked to appraisals of deservingness and personal control. Authentic pride displays are likable and convey status in the form of prestige, increasing benign envy. Hubristic pride displays are less likable and convey status in the form of dominance, increasing malicious <b>envy.</b> Collectively, <b>the</b> evidence supports the model of <b>the</b> elicitation of <b>envy.</b> I highlight future research opportunities regarding <b>the</b> coordination of <b>envy's</b> components and how this approach informs emotion research in general...|$|R

40|$|This paper derives optimal {{commodity}} {{taxes in}} a two-class economy, based on Chaudhuri (1986) and Diamantaras and Thomson's (1990) λ-equitability. An allocation is λ-equitable if no agent envies a proportion λ of {{the bundle of}} any other agent. We examine the properties of Pareto undominated allocations for various λ-equitability requirements.

As to the total tax burden, <b>the</b> <b>envying</b> agent may bear a higher tax burden, since the good which he likes should be taxed more heavily to reduce envy. Also, due to the conflict between welfare of <b>the</b> <b>envying</b> agent and his envy, there exists an economy in which the Diamantaras-Thomson allocation [...] an allocation which maximizes λ {{in the range of}} Pareto efficient allocations [...] is the Pareto efficient allocation which minimizes the welfare of <b>the</b> <b>envying</b> agent.

30|$|Regarded as {{a strong}} emotion, envy is hard to hide or change once it arises (Parrott and Smith, 1993). Consequently, <b>the</b> emotion of <b>envy</b> is likely to compel people to do {{something}} to discharge the negative experience so that people can maintain mental balance (Tai et al., 2012). Followers who are envious tend to take measures to reduce the gap between him/her and <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> target. Two ways to reach that goal are improving the self and/or depressing the other (Cohen-Charash, 2009). As we discussed before, it is almost impossible for followers to change the LMX relationship only on their own (Maslyn & Uhl-Bien, 2001). As a result, when followers feel envious toward others who have higher-quality LMX relationships, {{they are more likely to}} adopt destructive interpersonal behaviors to undermine the target. Research has shown that envy has been deemed to have the power to profoundly affect interpersonal relationships, creating conflict that can manifest as violence and aggression (Vecchio, 2000; Thompson et al., 2016). Previous research has supported the notion that an envious person may harm <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person, which negatively alters <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person’s better outcomes (Kim & Glomb, 2014).|$|R
