5|$|By September 3, 2009, {{attorneys}} representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, {{had requested}} that <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> registrar of Eiland-Hall's website delete the site. Beck's lawyers characterized the site's location as libelous. They demanded that <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy-protection {{service for the}} website, and turn over contact information for the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall. The registrar, NameCheap, refused. On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> registrar, repeating their requests and noting that they had read the website's contents and were therefore aware from statements posted to the site that its operator had been notified by the registrar.|$|E

5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level domain registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name itunes.co.uk. <b>The</b> <b>domain</b> initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered domain name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E

50|$|The 3D crystal {{structure}} of human POR has been determined. The molecule {{is composed of}} four structural domains: <b>the</b> FMN-binding <b>domain,</b> <b>the</b> connecting <b>domain,</b> <b>the</b> FAD-binding <b>domain,</b> and NADPH-binding <b>domain.</b> <b>The</b> FMN-binding <b>domain</b> {{is similar to the}} structure of FMN-containing protein flavodoxin, whereas <b>the</b> FAD-binding <b>domain</b> and NADPH-binding domains {{are similar to those of}} flavoprotein ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR). <b>The</b> connecting <b>domain</b> is situated between the flavodoxin-like and FNR-like domains.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> C-terminal <b>domain</b> is {{connected}} to <b>the</b> N-terminal <b>domain</b> by a flexible hinge, which can separate <b>the</b> two <b>domains.</b> <b>The</b> amino acid sequences {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> two <b>domains</b> facing each other are conserved in bacterial and firefly luciferase, thereby strongly suggesting that the active site is located in the cleft between <b>the</b> <b>domains.</b>|$|R

5|$|Their {{second letter}} to NameCheap {{observed}} that the site was still operational on September 4, 2009, {{in spite of their}} prior requests on behalf of Beck. <b>The</b> <b>domain</b> registrar changed the name server of the website without telling Eiland-Hall; after contacting the registrar, he was permitted to return to his original name server. In an interview with Gawker on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall remarked that Beck's attorneys contacted the registrar of <b>the</b> <b>domain,</b> his hosting provider, as well as the company which housed the servers for his website. He noted that the hosting provider informed him they would not cooperate with the requests from Beck's lawyers unless they received a court order.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{registering}} a domain, {{the user}} signs a declaration {{that they are}} not infringing on the rights of other parties and that the user will assume full responsibility for any consequences of use of <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name. The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings. Issues which could give the right to take over a domain name include infringements of the Trademarks Act and the Marketing Control Act. Trademark holders will also be awarded <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> if the registration was solely made to sell <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> to the trademark owner. The dispute bodies will also consider the risk of confusion, based on <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E
5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, in and of themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
40|$|Nano-sized domains {{were studied}} {{systematically}} in 10 - 30  at. % Gd-doped ceria. By using energy filtering transmission electron microscopy, {{it was observed}} that Gd cations could segregate in <b>the</b> <b>domains.</b> Due to <b>the</b> requirement of electrical neutrality, oxygen vacancies may also segregate into <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> with <b>the</b> dopant cations. Through study of electron energy loss spectroscopy, the local ordering of oxygen vacancies in <b>the</b> <b>domains</b> was further confirmed. Furthermore, <b>the</b> nano-sized <b>domains</b> and <b>the</b> local ordering develop with increasing doping concentration.

5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of <b>the</b> <b>domain,</b> so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) to a pair (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

5|$|Registration {{takes place}} through a third party, a domain name registrar. The {{relationship}} between Norid, the registrar and the holder is regulated through civil legal agreements. The registrar registers <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> {{on behalf of}} the holder, and the holder then holds the right to <b>the</b> <b>domain</b> name until it is terminated, unless a dispute resolution dictates otherwise. Norid charges registrars 60 Norwegian krone (NOK) per registration and change of holder, as well as NOK60 in an annual fee per domain. Registrars must meet criteria regarding technical and administrative resources, must pay an annual fee of NOK5,000 and a deposit of minimum NOK10,000, depending on activity level. Registrars must also undertake a minimum activity of either administrating or registering forty domains per year.|$|E

50|$|SR {{proteins}} {{can have}} more than one RRM <b>domain.</b> <b>The</b> second RRM <b>domain</b> is called <b>the</b> RNA recognition motif homolog (RRMH). RRM domains are located near the N-terminus end of SR proteins. <b>The</b> RRM <b>domain</b> mediates <b>the</b> RNA interactions of the SR proteins by binding to exon splicing enhancer sequences. The RRMH usually has weaker interactions with RNA compared to <b>the</b> RRM <b>domain.</b> From NMR, <b>the</b> RRM <b>domain</b> of SRSF1, an SR protein, has a RNA binding fold structure. <b>The</b> RRM <b>domain</b> may also protect <b>the</b> phosphorylated RS <b>domain,</b> which suggests that <b>the</b> RS <b>domain</b> fits into <b>the</b> RRM <b>domain.</b>|$|R

50|$|Each subunit of HSP60 {{has three}} domains: <b>the</b> apical <b>domain,</b> <b>the</b> {{equatorial}} <b>domain,</b> and <b>the</b> intermediate <b>domain.</b> <b>The</b> equatorial <b>domain</b> contains <b>the</b> binding site for ATP {{and for the}} other heptameric ring. <b>The</b> intermediate <b>domain</b> binds <b>the</b> equatorial <b>domain</b> and <b>the</b> apical <b>domain</b> together. <b>The</b> intermediate <b>domain</b> induces a conformational change when ATP is bound allowing for an alternation between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrate binding sites. In its inactive state, the protein is in a hydrophobic state. When activated by ATP, <b>the</b> intermediate <b>domain</b> undergoes a conformational change that exposes the hydrophilic region. This insures fidelity in protein binding. Chaperonin 10 aids HSP60 in folding by acting as a dome-like cover on the ATP active form of HSP60. This causes the central cavity to enlarge and aids in protein folding. See the above figure for further detail on the structure.|$|R
