25|$|Pakistan {{has had a}} {{moratorium}} on executions since 2008. Currently there are approximately 800 people on death row in Pakistan in terrorism related cases. The move comes following the widely held perception that <b>terrorists</b> <b>are</b> never brought to justice in Pakistan. Many times, the judges and witnesses are too scared {{to come forward and}} award due sentences to the terrorists. And even when the <b>terrorists</b> <b>are</b> convicted and sent to prison, the frail policing system of Pakistan has seen many jailbreaks, including the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan jailbreaks, in which many high-profile terrorists escaped.|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{examined}} the moderating effects of right wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation {{on the relationship}} between terrorist images (soldiers vs. criminals) and preference for counterterrorist actions (military aggression vs. criminal prosecution). Study 1 indicated that the perception of Al-Qaeda <b>terrorists</b> as soldiers <b>was</b> related to preference for military counterterrorism, especially among people high in social dominance orientation. The relationship between the perception of Al-Qaeda terrorists as criminals and preference for the criminal prosecution of <b>terrorists</b> <b>was</b> strengthened among those high in right wing authoritarianism. Study 2 showed that when <b>terrorists</b> <b>were</b> framed as soldiers, social dominance orientation was related to support for military counterterrorism. When <b>terrorists</b> <b>were</b> framed as criminals, only people who endorsed high levels of right wing authoritarianism supported criminal prosecution of terrorists. Social dominance orientation was related to opposition towards military counterterrorism when <b>terrorists</b> <b>were</b> not perceived as soldiers or framed as criminals. It was also related to opposition towards criminal prosecution of <b>terrorists</b> when <b>terrorists</b> <b>were</b> framed as criminals. The findings suggest that different <b>terrorist</b> images <b>are</b> related to preference for counterterrorism that corresponds with the content of the images and individuals’ chronic ideological orientations...|$|R

25|$|The film {{concerns}} {{a group of}} aspiring terrorists from leftist bourgeois backgrounds who kidnap an industrialist during carnival season unaware {{that they have been}} manipulated by the capitalist and the authorities whose hidden agenda is for terrorism to create a demand for security hardware and to gain support for harsher security measures.

Official sources said after a detailed analysis by security agencies and defense forces feel that allowing Google to cover India would compromise the country’s security interest.

25|$|Neoconservatives and the Bush Doctrine {{held that}} the hatred for the West and United States in {{particular}} does not exist because of actions perpetrated by the United States, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy. The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of United States are using terrorism as a war of ideology against the United States. The responsibility of the United States is to protect itself and its friends by promoting democracy where the <b>terrorists</b> <b>are</b> located so as to undermine the basis for terrorist activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of psychopathy {{has been associated}} with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes. <b>Terrorists</b> <b>are</b> sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame externalization. However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism.|$|E
25|$|Among Tom Ligon's many {{short and}} {{medium-sized}} works (and one award-winning science fact {{article published in}} relation to Fusion rocket technology and advocate of Inertial Electrodynamic Fusion), two published in 1986 and 1993, The Devil and the Deep Black Void, and The Gardener in Analog Magazine, are science fiction stories which are about a Shi'a Muslim terrorist organization in a largely Muslim space-faring civilization where Bahá'ís are space colonists who undertake terraforming on a planet they named Mazra'ih (though there is brief mention of a United States National Spiritual Assembly back on Earth.) The prequel, For a Little Price about how <b>terrorists</b> <b>are</b> prevented from crashing a spaceship into the Earth (long predating {{the events of the}} September 11, 2001 attacks) was anthologized in 2008 though work began on it in 1986. In the succeeding stories some of the <b>terrorists</b> <b>are</b> instead driven to an unusual world orbiting a neutron star where Bahá'ís live which eventually reveals that civilizations have reached great levels of technology and then mysteriously disappeared. The initial thought is that the civilizations are eradicated by a periodic sterilization the planet undergoes but there is also evidence the civilizations vanished peacefully before the sterilization speculating that civilizations shortly after achieving deep space exploration reach some new level of civilization that doesn't require or sustain material civilization in deep space. The ethical conflict of pacifism, a debatable stance associated with the Bahá'í Faith, in the face of terrorists is worked out. One character, who takes on the name of the historical Bábí who performed an assassination attempt on the life of the Shah of Iran, chooses the path of violence in defense of the population by way (as portrayed) of matching a strength of the Bahá'í Faith in acceptance of science compared to a weakness of Shia Islam of superstition.|$|E

25|$|Significant {{conclusions}} of the report include the main objective, that American foreign policy and homeland security policies must adapt to better {{stem the tide of}} U.S. citizens traveling to and from distant battlefields. The report identifies police officials from the non-federal level who have cited their own personal worries about lack of resources in the form of security clearances in order to help the federal government deal with counterterrorism. The report identifies weak spots along the chain of foreign travel where <b>terrorists</b> <b>are</b> able to slip out of counterterrorism oversight capabilities. The authors of the work describe holes in law enforcement checkpoints both within the United States and more significantly in European countries were it is increasingly not difficult for terrorists to travel {{back and forth to the}} Western world.|$|E
