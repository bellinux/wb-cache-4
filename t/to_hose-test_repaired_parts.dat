Recently, IoT and 3 D printer technologies have been progressed and application cases to manufacturing and maintenance have been increased. Especially in air flight industry, various sensing data are collected during flight by IoT technologies and parts are created by 3 D printers. And IoT platforms which improve development/operation of IoT applications also have been appeared. However, existing IoT platforms mainly targets to visualize "things" statuses by batch processing of collected sensing data, and 3 factors of real-time, automatic orders of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> and parts stock cost are insufficient to accelerate businesses. This paper targets maintenance of business vehicles such as airplane or high-speed bus. We propose a maintenance platform with real-time analysis, automatic orders of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> and minimum stock cost of parts. The proposed platform collects data via closed VPN, analyzes stream data and predicts failures in real-time by online machine learning framework Jubatus, coordinates ERP or SCM via in memory DB to order <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> and also distributes <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> data to 3 D printers to create <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> near the destination.

The thesis explores the current methods of MK 16 <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> inventory design and recommends changes that permit the inventory manager to model an improved inventory within the constraints of each specific scenario. While providing inventory managers the ability to experiment with 'what if' scenarios, the spreadsheet also provides the commanding officer greater control over unit readiness. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Navys current inventory and requisition management procedures for issuing <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> onboard ships have remained relatively unchanged for decades. As {{a result of}} current practices, many ships are experiencing higher average customer wait times (ACWT) for <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> onboard ship. The U. S. Navy has identified the need to reduce this wait {{time in order to}} complete shipboard repairs faster and increase readiness levels across the fleet. Applying a six sigma define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) process approach, this report describes current procedures from initial demand to issue of <b>repair</b> <b>parts,</b> including collecting and analyzing quantitative and qualitative data. Recommendations and conclusions are offered to improve the overall process, identify bottlenecks, improve response time to demand, and reduce shipboard procedure inefficiencies.

40|$|A basic {{function}} in the proper management of <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories is the anticipation of demand. The US Navy maintains a database of univariate demand data for its <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> inventories using a quarterly time interval and {{a limited number of}} periods. Historically, the exponential smoothing procedure has been used for demand forecasting. This method is simple and robust, but it does not make use of any characteristics of the entire time series such as trend, cycles, presence of outliers or demand clustering. Sharper information may be available {{with the use of the}} Box-Jenkins system. Not all <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> can capitalize on this and there is a problem in identifying those that do. Moreover the number of parts is quite large and the speed of identification is an issue. This paper addresses this problem. The research begins with the development of several simple, robust and dimensionless time series features. These are used to predict the suitability of Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) modeling. Two predictive models are considered: classical regression and a modern expert-system statistical package, ModelQuest(TM). Their strengths and weaknesses are compared. The result of either is a computationally simple means for determining which <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> time series may benefit from the Box-Jenkins methodology for purposes of inventory management.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of ranking items {{according}} to their worth, where each item has associated with it a vector of attributes. In particular, a ranking system is developed and tested for aviation <b>repair</b> <b>parts.</b> The objective of the study is to determine whether some items are more important than others for the accomplishment of aircraft missions. If items differ in essentiality, it is important to take such differences into account in providing logistics support. The essentiality ranking is made by generating a vector of attributes for each <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> on the basis of human judgments. These judgments are obtained using a questionnaire which explicitly establishes the ground rules for making attribute assignments. Judgmental priority rules are then applied to the vectors to rank the items. The proposed methodology was tested for four configurations of aircraft. In the course of the study, a wide dispersion in the essentiality of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> was found. Of equal significance, a high degree of consistency was also noted among a large number of respondents. The ranking procedure, although designed for military aircraft, has other applications, including commercial ones. Such applications are appropriate whenever budgetary or other considerations require a priority system for allocating resources, e. g., in the procurement and distribution of material stocks including <b>repair</b> <b>parts.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to assess {{the applicability of the}} Graham Decision Model for Spare Parts, a process flow chart developed by Lieutenant Ruth Graham, United States Navy, to the wholesale replenishment of communication and electronic <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> by the Purchasing Division, Directorate of Contracting, Sacramento Army Depot, United States Army Depot Systems Command. The model was developed {{to be used as a}} decision tool by Department of Defense item managers and acquisition managers in identifying <b>repair</b> <b>part</b> candidates for Life Cycle Costing. This thesis tests the applicability of the decision model using selected communication and electronic <b>repair</b> <b>parts.</b> The researcher found that Life Cycle Cost factors are not considered during the wholesale replenishment of <b>repair</b> <b>parts</b> at the depot or inventory control point level. The researcher found that performance data are neither available to, nor determinable by, the user of the model in order to fully apply the model and make Life Cycle Costing decisions. The researcher proposes that performance data be collected by the inventory control points through the Commodity Command Standard System for use in Life Cycle Costing decisions. Additionally, the researcher proposes modifications to sequencing of the criteria used in the Graham Decision Model for Spare Parts and recommends two additional criteria for use in the decision process at the Sacramento Army Depot.
