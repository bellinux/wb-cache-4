5|$|In practice, {{the delegates}} rarely discuss issues at length at the National Congresses. Most {{substantive}} discussion takes place before <b>the</b> <b>congress,</b> <b>in</b> the preparation period, {{among a group}} of top party leaders. In between National Congresses, the Central Committee is the highest decision-making institution. The CCDI is responsible for supervising party's internal anti-corruption and ethics system.

5|$|According to the Athenian playwright Aeschylus, who {{actually}} fought at Salamis, the Greek fleet numbered 310 triremes (the difference being {{the number of}} Athenian ships). Ctesias claims that the Athenian fleet numbered only 110 triremes, which ties in with Aeschylus's numbers. According to Hyperides, the Greek fleet numbered only 220. The fleet was effectively {{under the command of}} Themistocles, but nominally led by the Spartan nobleman Eurybiades, as had been agreed at <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>in</b> 481 BC. Although Themistocles had tried to claim leadership of the fleet, the other city states with navies objected, and so Sparta (which had no naval tradition) was given command of the fleet as a compromise.|$|E

Alfonsín returned to Chascomús. The UCRP prevailed over the UCRI the following year, leading to the presidency of Arturo Umberto Illia. Alfonsín was elected a national deputy, and then {{vice president of the}} UCRP bloc in <b>the</b> <b>congress.</b> <b>In</b> 1963 he was appointed president of the party committee for the province of Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war.

He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

Du Bois restated the resolutions of <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>in</b> his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts.

5|$|Gandhi took {{leadership}} of <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared {{the independence of}} India. The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the British responded by imprisoning him {{and tens of thousands}} of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947 the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.|$|E

He began {{to give up his}} remedies, particularly because of his then recent trial, and gradually left Spiritism, as he was sometimes deceived by false mediums.

5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, witness in a trial of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006. This caused a national scandal, as it was suspected that he was disappeared to intimidate other witnesses in the upcoming trials, and the government was unable to locate him.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam {{gathered}} {{delegates from}} 14 different countries, among which important {{figures of the}} anarchist movement, including Errico Malatesta, Pierre Monatte, Luigi Fabbri, Benoît Broutchoux, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Rocker, and Christiaan Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>in</b> particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, popular education issues, the general strike or antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism (or trade unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was reformist and even conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.|$|E
5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections.

The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner told him that he had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc in <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>in</b> 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 midterm elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa.
