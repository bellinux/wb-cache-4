5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
500|$|Ben Gerson from Rolling Stone {{called the}} songs on the album [...] "forgettable" [...] and [...] "unconvincing". He also criticized Streisand's {{authenticity}} when singing lyrics that he considered [...] "meaningless from the lips of an American". Because of the lackluster response generated from the record, Streisand decided to work with new musicians on her following album, Lazy Afternoon (1975). Her decision pleased both critics and her fans, who felt that the new album was stronger than ButterFly. Years later in 1991, Streisand took <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> Live and announced her complete displeasure with ButterFly and {{the songs on}} it. She deemed it as her least favorite album and joked that {{she would like to}} withdraw it from her catalog altogether.|$|E

Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E
50|$|Cipriano's {{national}} {{live television}} airing prank call career began with talk shows; his first call was in 1989, when he telephoned <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King's</b> talk show <b>Larry</b> King Live.

[...] "Ithink until you see it firsthand, it's {{kind of hard to}} conceive of how brutal it is," [...] Rogen said to CNN. [...] "Until I saw it, you just don't get kind of how heartbreaking it can be."

Both he and Miller spoke <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> for ALarry King Special, Unthinkable: The Alzheimer's Epidemic, which aired in April 2011. Rogen testified about the disease and his charity before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services on February 26, 2014.|$|E
500|$|The Mutual Broadcasting System (commonly {{referred}} to simply as Mutual; sometimes {{referred to}} as MBS, [...] Mutual Radio or the Mutual Radio Network; corporate name Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc.) was an American radio network in operation from 1934 to 1999.

He also stated that [...] "Broadway divas do not take naturally to singing 'Ooh baby, here I am. Come rub it on my belly like guava jelly'". In agreement, writer Shaun Considine claimed that one unknown critic in particular panned the track, stating [...] "Streisand was not born to sing reggae", while another joked that he/she had [...] "no comment" [...] to make {{in response to the}} release. Ben Gerson, writing for Rolling Stone, found the singer to be [...] "unconvincingly animal" [...] throughout her rendition. He continued, [...] "Being beautiful, romantic and desirable have not come to her so effortlessly that she can easily throw them over for the sake a little authentic, malodorous sweat." ...|$|E

It was later performed on the Rock Witchu Tour, Number Ones, Up Close and Personal, Unbreakable World Tour, and the 2017 State of the World Tour.

500|$|The episode name is {{a parody}} of One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss. [...] The sushi bar that the Simpson family visits is located on a street called Elm Street, a {{reference}} to the A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise. While waiting for Homer to finish his meal at the sushi bar, Bart and Lisa sneak into the bar's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft, [...] "Theme from Shaft" [...] by Isaac Hayes. In the karaoke room, a gentleman introduces himself as Richie Sakai, a reference to a producer on The Simpsons with the same name. He proceeds to sing the 1971 song [...] "Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves" [...] by Cher. Homer sings his own version of the gospel hymn [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In" [...] while listening to Lisa playing her saxophone one last time. When Homer arrives at his home after leaving Moe's Tavern, he hammers on one of the windows of the house and shouts Marge's name.

According to his later {{description}} <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King,</b> he stated at the meeting that [...] "sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve months there would be an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people again {{how important it is to}} have a strong healthy defense department that contributes to... that underpins peace and stability in our world.

6000|$|Neale did {{not tell}} Larry what he had heard. The cowboy changed subtly, but not in his {{attitude}} toward Neale. Benton and its wildness might have been his proper setting. So many rough and bad men, inspired by the time and place, essayed to be equal to Benton. But they lasted a day and were forgotten. The great compliment paid <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> was {{the change in the}} attitude of this wild camp. He had been one among many--a stranger. In time when the dance-halls grew quiet as he entered and the gambling-hells suspended their games. His fame increased as from lip to lip his story passed, always gaining something. Jealousy, hatred, and fear grew with his fame. It was hinted that he was always seeking some man or men from California. He had been known to question new arrivals: [...] "Might you-all happen to be from California? Have you ever heard of an outfit that made off with a girl out heah in the hills?" ...|$|E
60|$|Neale, not {{altogether}} {{in the interest}} of his search for Allie, became a friend and companion of Place Hough. Ancliffe sought him, also, and he was often in the haunts of these men. They did not take so readily <b>to</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King.</b> The cowboy had become a sort of nervous factor in any community; his presence was not conducive to a comfortable hour. For Larry, though he still drawled his talk and sauntered around, looked the name the Texan visitors had left him. His flashing blue eyes, cold and intent and hard in his naming red face, his blazing red hair, his stalking form, and his gun swinging low--these characteristics were so striking as to make his presence always felt. Beauty Stanton insisted the cowboy had ruined her business and that she had a terror of him. But Neale doubted the former statement. All business, good and bad, grew in Benton. It was strange that as this attractive and notorious woman conceived a terror of Larry, she formed an infatuation for Neale. He would have been blind to it but for the dry humor of Place Hough, and the amiable indifference of Ancliffe, who had anticipated a rival in Neale. Their talk, like most talk, drifted through Neale's ears. What did he care? Both Hough and Ancliffe began to loom large to Neale. They wasted every day, every hour; and yet, underneath the one's cold, passionless pursuit of gold, and the other's serene and gentle quest for effacement there was something finer left of other years. Benton was full of gamblers and broken men who had once been gentlemen. Neale met them often--gambled with them, watched them. He measured them all. They had given life up, but within him there was a continual struggle. He swore to himself, as he had to Larry, that life was hopeless without Allie Lee--yet there was never a sleeping or a waking hour that he gave up hope. The excitement and allurement of the dance-halls, though he admitted their power, were impossible for him; and he frequented them, as he went everywhere else, only in search of a possible clue.|$|E
