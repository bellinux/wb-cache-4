40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive wheel model that can quantitatively evaluate <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> of ﬂexible/rigid wheelsdriving on deformable terrain. The proposed model exploits a terramechanics-based approach with taking account of pressures generated by wheel elasticity {{as well as}} terrain stiffness. Deﬂection of a ﬂexible wheel typically depends on a relative pressure between thewheel and terrain: the wheel will be signiﬁcantly deformed on rigid terrain whereas it will be hardly deformed on soft terrain. Therefore, the wheel-terrain interaction in the proposed model {{is divided into three}} contact sections: wheel front section, wheel deﬂected(ﬂat) section, and wheel rear section. The traction force of the wheel is obtained as an integral of normal and shear stresses generatedat each section. Simulation studies with varied wheel pressures, such as ﬂexible, semi-ﬂexible, and rigid wheels, are conducted tovalidate the proposed model. Also, <b>traction</b> <b>performances</b> of ﬂexible/rigid wheels are compared based on a metric called tractiveefﬁciency. The comparison implies an optimal wheel pressure of ﬂexible wheel for better <b>traction</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{to simulate the}} <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> of mechanical front wheel drive MFWD tractors was developed at the Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon ART. The model was validated via several field tests in which the relationship between drawbar pull and slip was measured for four MFWD tractors of power ranging between 40 and 123 kW on four arable soils of different texture (clay, clay loam, silty loam, and loamy sand). The pulling tests were carried out in steady-state controlling the pulling force along numerous corridors. Different configurations of tractors were considered by changing the wheel load and the tyre pressure. Simulations of <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> matched experimental results with good agreement (mean error of 8 % with maximum and minimum values of 17 % and 1 % respectively). The model was used as framework for developing a new module for the excel application TASCV 3. 0. xlsm, a practical computer tool which compares different tractor configurations, soil textures and conditions, {{in order to determine}} variants which make for better <b>traction</b> <b>performance,</b> this resulting in saving fuel and time, i. e. reducing the costs of tillage management...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} tractor {{configuration}} is of primary importance in tillage {{operations for the}} optimisation of <b>traction</b> <b>performance,</b> i. e. for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. Tyre inflation pressure and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant role}} in controlling the <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> of a tractor. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of tyre inflation pressure and wheel load on the <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> of a mechanical front wheel drive MFWD tractor (65 kW engine power) on an agricultural clay (C) Vertic Cambisol on the basis of results of traction tests and simulations with a semi-empirical soil-tyre interaction model adapted for MFWD vehicles. The traction tests were carried out using four tractor configurations with two tractor weights (40. 8 kN and 50. 2 kN) and two tyre inflation pressures (60 kPa and 160 kPa). <b>Traction</b> <b>performance</b> was considered in terms of drawbar pull, traction coefficient, tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption in relation to wheel slip. A decrease in tyre pressure and an increase in wheel load resulted in higher drawbar pull however, only the former produced improvements in terms of coefficient of traction, tractive efficiency, power delivery efficiency and specific fuel consumption, while the only significant benefit resulting from the latter was a reduction in specific fuel consumption at a tyre pressure of 160 kPa and a slip of under 15 %. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grasslands are the {{important}} supplementary source of food. Shear strength at high soil bulk density grassland was studied {{to improve the}} <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> and develop the crop yield. Shear force and shear displacement are tested at different vertical loads. Results indicated that with the increasing of shear displacement, shear force was found to show a parabolic trend of first increasing then decreasing. Moreover, larger vertical load would lead to steeper shear force curve against shear displacement. It also should be noted that, the maximum shear stress showed a parabolic increase trend following the increasing of the normal stress. This is the theoretical basis of matching appropriately tractor and implement system to maximize the <b>traction</b> <b>performance</b> and reduce tire slip...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Tax {{incentives}} {{offered to}} attract firms engaged in {{foreign direct investment}} are often tied to <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> such as domestic content restrictions. The tax competition literature has repeatedly shown that competition between municipalities for mobile firms tends to drive taxes to low levels. One would expect a comparable result for burdensome <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> Despite this, {{the evidence suggests that}} while taxes have indeed been driven down, <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> are as popular as ever. We explain this seeming conundrum by showing that in the presence of spillovers, binding <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> can act as a coordination device for firms. In equilibrium, municipalities choose <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> which maximize joint surplus from investment. Competition between municipalities then transfers this surplus to firms via tax subsidies...|$|R

The aim of this thesis is to analyze ways of defining <b>performance</b> <b>requirements,</b> which are actually used on IT projects.

40|$|Underspecified <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> {{can cause}} <b>performance</b> {{issues in a}} {{software}} system. However, a complete, upfront analysis of a software system is difficult, and usually not desirable. We propose an evolutionary model for <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> specifications and corresponding validation testing. The principles of the model can be integrated into agile development methods. Using this approach, the <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research that}} extends current {{knowledge in the}} area of business process re-design, with a specific focus on the 'Make Product' process within manufacturing organisations. Current business process re-design approaches offer only limited guidance on the specific changes that can be made to a process when re-designing it to achieve the desired performance improvements and often overlook any strategically derived <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> when re-designing the process. Case experience suggests that practitioners do not consider the <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> of their business processes when re-designing them and that the actions they take to achieve performance improvements are not selected with regard to any strategically derived <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> This exploratory research investigates whether relationships can be established between the changes that can be made to a process when re-designing it and the performance improvements gained by implementing those changes. It then questions whether those relationships can be used to help companies to select the appropriate process changes to implement in order to meet their specific <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements</b> and process changes (Process Improvement Actions) were derived from the relevant literature and included in a questionnaire designed to ascertain the strength of relationships between them. The questionnaire was subject to preliminary and pilot testing to improve validation and reliability prior to being administered to international business process re-design 'experts'. Statistical analysis of the questionnaire data resulted in a ranked list of Process Improvement Actions for each of the <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements.</b> These were presented in a format for inclusion in a process-based change handbook and enable the practitioner to set the agenda for the intervention and select the Process Improvement Actions {{on the basis of the}} <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements.</b> The <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements</b> should be derived from the strategy of the company or change programme so a strategic focus is maintained throughout re-design. It was also found that of the thirteen Process Improvement Actions included in the questionnaire just five are needed to achieve improvements in a majority (80 %) of the <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> This research showed that it is possible to establish links between <b>Performance</b> <b>Requirements</b> and Process Improvement Actions and according to successful validation by practitioners, against an accepted model, that these can be used for business process re-design, laying foundations for future research in the area...|$|R
40|$|Classification {{requirements}} for real-world classification problems are often constrained by a given true positive or false positive rate {{to ensure that}} the classification error for the most important class is within a desired limit. For a sufficiently high true positive rate, this may result in the set-point being located somewhere in the flat portion of the ROC curve where the associated false positive rate is high. Any further classifier design will then attempt to reduce the false positive rate while maintaining the desired true positive rate. We call this type of <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> for classifier design the constrained <b>performance</b> <b>requirement.</b> This type of <b>performance</b> <b>requirements</b> is different from the accuracy maximization requirement and thus requires different strategies for classifier design. This paper is concerned with designing classifier ensembles under such constrained <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> Classifier ensembles {{are one of the most}} significant advances in pattern recognition/classification in recent years and have been actively studied by many researchers. However, not much attention has been given to designing ensembles to satisfy constrained <b>performance</b> <b>requirements.</b> This paper attempts to identify and address some of design related issues associated with the constrained <b>performance</b> <b>requirement.</b> Specifically, we present a design strategy for designing neural network ensembles to satisfy constrained <b>performance</b> <b>requirements,</b> which is illustrated by designing a real-world classification problem.
