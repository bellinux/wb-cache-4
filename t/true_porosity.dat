5000|$|Recent {{attempts}} at obtaining better porosity estimates {{under these conditions}} have been reported. These attempts show {{that the use of}} a neutron porosity device which has a DOI {{similar to that of the}} density device could simplify porosity evaluation in gas reservoirs. However, as previously stated, in a partially invaded gas information, there can be a large error in the determination of the <b>true</b> <b>porosity</b> using either the density or neutron measurement. Therefore, a means is needed for determining the <b>true</b> <b>porosity</b> at an unknown formation depth of invasion using the measured density and neutron porosities in a gas zone or partially saturated gas zone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{estimating}} the <b>true</b> <b>porosity</b> {{in the gas}} region relies on the appropriate use of the two porosity logs. The process is further complicated by the effects of borehole fluid invasion. Invasion tends to force the gas from the formation {{and replace it with}} borehole fluid. The neutron tool begins to sense the presence of more hydrogen atoms and yields a porosity estimate that is higher than before when only the gas was present; the opposite occurs for the density tool. The increase in the amount of water in the near formation, i.e., {{the increase in the number}} of electrons, is interpreted by the density tool algorithm as a higher density which translates into a lower porosity estimate. The end result is that the separation between the two curves begins to disappear as the invasion front increases in radial depth. The rate at which the two porosity logs approach the <b>true</b> <b>porosity</b> depends upon their radial sensitivities and their respective depths of investigations (DOI).|$|E
50|$|The density tool, on {{the other}} hand, {{measures}} {{the total number of}} formation electrons. Like the neutron tool, water-filled formations are used in its calibration process. Under these conditions, a lower number of electrons is equivalent to a lower formation density, or a higher formation porosity. Therefore, logging a gas-filled formation, results in a porosity estimate that is higher than the <b>true</b> <b>porosity.</b> Overlaying the neutron and density curves in a gas-bearing zone results in the classic crossover separation.|$|E
50|$|This method {{provides}} {{a much more}} accurate estimate of the <b>true</b> formation <b>porosity,</b> {{in the presence of}} gas, particularly in formations that are not invaded by fluids from the wellbore.|$|R
5000|$|A popular {{method of}} obtaining a {{formation}} porosity estimate {{is based on the}} simultaneous use of neutron and density logs. Under normal logging conditions, the porosity estimates obtained from these tools agree, when plotted on an appropriate lithology and fluid scale. However, {{in the case of a}} reservoir where there is gas instead of water or oil in the pore space, the two porosity logs separate, to form what is referred to as gas crossover. Under these conditions, the <b>true</b> formation <b>porosity</b> lies between the measured neutron and density values. Log interpreters often find it difficult to accurately estimate the <b>true</b> formation <b>porosity</b> from these two curves.|$|R

On increasing the moisture content from 7. 6 to 25 %, <b>true</b> density, <b>porosity</b> and thousand kernel weight increased. Coefficient of static friction on plywood was found maximum for kernel at 25 % moisture content, while it was minimum for seed on glass at 7. 6 % moisture content. The angle of repose was maximum for kernel as compared to seed. Initial cracking force, average rupture force and average rupture energy for seed and kernel decreased {{with an increase in}} the moisture content. The kernel was found to be more resistant to initial cracking than seed...|$|R
5000|$|As the {{invasion}} fluid front gets {{deeper into the}} reservoir, the neutron and density porosity measurements approach the <b>true</b> <b>porosity.</b> For shallow invasion, i.e. shallow {{with respect to the}} depths of investigation (DOIs) of the two tools, the tools' responses are spatially weighted averages of the invaded and noninvaded regions of the formation. The result is a reduced crossover. For deep invasion (invasion beyond the DOIs of both tools) the crossover indication disappears and the two logs will not recognize the presence of gas.|$|E
5000|$|Neutron {{and density}} logging tools have {{different}} {{responses to the}} presence of gas in the formation because of differences in the physics of the measurements. A neutron tool response is sensitive mainly to the number of hydrogen atoms in the formation. During the calibration process, water-filled formations are used to develop porosity algorithms, and under these conditions, a lower number of hydrogen atoms is equivalent to a lower porosity. Consequently, when a gas-filled formation is logged, which has a lower number of hydrogen atoms than a water-filled formation of the same porosity, the porosity estimate will be lower than the <b>true</b> <b>porosity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{combination}} of neutron and density logs {{takes advantage of}} the fact that lithology has opposite effects on these two porosity measurements. The average of neutron and density porosity values is usually close to the <b>true</b> <b>porosity,</b> regardless of lithology. Another advantage of this combination is the [...] "gas effect." [...] Gas, being less dense than liquids, translates into a density-derived porosity that is too high. Gas, on the other hand, has much less hydrogen per unit volume than liquids: neutron-derived porosity, which is based on the amount of hydrogen, is too low. If both logs are displayed on compatible scales, they overlay each other in liquid-filled clean formations and are widely separated in gas-filled formations.|$|E
40|$|Simulations of {{flow and}} {{transport}} in two-dimensional representations of heterogeneous fractured media {{are used to}} investigate the errors and biases associated with effective flow porosity estimates derived from cross-hole tracer tests. A method is presented for constructing probability distributions of 'correction factors' {{that can be used}} to correct apparent flow porosities obtained from tracer tests to obtain 'true' flow porosities in fracture systems. Although only a limited number of the many possible variations in fracture flow system properties is investigated, it is concluded that effective flow porosities derived from cross-hole tracer tests have a strong tendency to overpredict <b>true</b> flow <b>porosities</b> in fracture flow systems. This tendency toward overprediction decreases as the fracture conductivity relative to the background conductivity field decreases and as the orientation of the most conductive fractures becomes better aligned with the two wells. Tracer tests with small amounts of recirculation of water from the production well to the injection well are predicted to result in much better estimates of <b>true</b> flow <b>porosity</b> (on average), and with much less variability in the estimates, than tests with no reclrculation. However, the advantage offered by recirculation decreases as the fracture conductivity relative to the background conductivity decreases...|$|R

50|$|Determining the <b>true</b> <b>porosity</b> {{of a gas}} filled {{formation}} {{has always}} been a problem in the oil industry. While natural gas is a hydrocarbon, similar to oil, the physical properties of the fluids are very different, making it very hard to correctly quantify the total amount of gas in a formation. Well logging interpretation of the amount of hydrocarbon in the pore space of a formation, relies on the fluid being oil. Gas is light compared to oil causing density logging (gamma ray emitting sensors) based measurements to produce anomalous signals. Similarly, measurements that rely on detecting hydrogen (neutron emitting sensors) can miss detecting or correctly interpreting the presence of gas because of the lower hydrogen concentration in gas, compared to oil.|$|E
5000|$|A main {{complication}} in deriving {{an accurate}} porosity {{in the presence}} of shallow invasion {{comes from the fact that}} the neutron and density logging devices typically have different DOIs. It is well known that the 50% DOI of the thermal neutron porosity tool is 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) depending upon the porosity and gas saturation of the formation and the 50% DOI of the density tool is about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm). When the invasion front is greater than 12 inches (30 cm), both tools see only water-filled formations and the two porosity estimates agree and read <b>true</b> <b>porosity.</b> When the invasion front is less than 12 inches (30 cm) but greater than 6 inches (15 cm), the density tool sees only the invaded formation while the neutron tool is sensitive to both the invaded and the noninvaded region. Under these conditions, the density porosity estimate is the true value, while the neutron porosity estimate is still low. Below 6 inches (15 cm) of invasion, both tools are sensitive to both the invaded and noninvaded regions. Thus, for a certain range of depths of invasion, accurate determination of formation porosity becomes very difficult.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a model study on the propagation of periodic fluctuations in the piezometric head through a saturated porous media. Three different models were employed: a hydraulic model, a mathematical model, and an electrical analog model. The hydraulic model consisted of one or more layers of polyurethene foam placed in a lucite tank. The foam was tested in a confined and unconfined condition using both a no-flow and a constant-head boundary condition at the internal boundary. The mathematical and electric analog models duplicated the conditions in the hydraulic model. The results of the study indicate that diffusion theory can describe the propagation of such disturbances provided that the boundary conditions are satisfied and that the correct diffusion coefficient is employed. The calculation of the correct diffusion coefficient requires that an appropriate storage coefficient and an apparent porosity be used for the confined and unconfined models, respectively.

On the western flank of the Ozark Dome, these rocks dip in a west-southwest direction into the subsurface where they are oil and gas reservoirs. A series of road cuts and surface exposures are cropped out in the tri-state area of northwest Arkansas, northeastern Oklahoma, and southwestern Missouri. Outcrop characteristics, including an abundant amount of nodular, anastomosing chert, generally finer-grained carbonate texture, and stratigraphic relationships provide an analog for its subsurface counterpart. Based on core description and well log correlation, the Reeds Spring Formation developed in the Cherokee Platform in western Osage and eastern Kay County, Oklahoma reflect transportation of crinozoan detritus, spicules, and carbonate mud off the Burlington shelf, passing downslope from the north, northwest, and northeast, into deeper waters of the deep shelf margin setting. As the result, its subsurface lithologies are characterized by shaly fine-grained spiculitic crinoid wackestone.

Through these techniques used pore types, porosity and cement values were identified, to determine whether these alternative methods of petrographic image analysis and Computed Tomography (CT) technology could be viable techniques to replace older image analysis methodologies that take more time, money and are far more destructive. To accomplish this, a workflow was developed to analyze petrographic images and CT scan data. These values were then evaluated for accuracy {{by comparing the results}} to a previous study which used helium injection testing, a method considered to have a high level of accuracy. The Happy Spraberry Field is located in the South Central part of Garza County, Texas. It forms part of the Eastern Shelf, which produces from a 100 foot thick carbonate interval and is the second largest oil field that produces from the Lower Clear Fork Formation in the Midland Basin. The formation consists of six facies that have been identified in previous studies. These facies are oolitic skeletal grainstones and packstones, floatstones and rudstones, In situ Tubiphytes bindstones, and siltstones from slope deposits. There was a slightly lower trend in the porosity values from this study and the benchmark data from the helium test analysis. This discrepancy was attributed to the low resolution, and incomplete magnification of the microporosity from the computer and images. The results were within a reasonable range of the <b>true</b> <b>porosity</b> values, but can be improved by reworking the workflow used. The cement values obtained through this workflow helped demonstrate the idea that high cementation levels directly correlate to low porosity values. These results are considered to be accurate due to the specific way in which the workflow was modified to only color-change the pixels inside the cemented areas.

During the drying, bulk density and <b>true</b> density, <b>porosity,</b> thousand-grain mass, circularity, sphericity, projected and surface area, and surface-volume ratio were measured. Based on these results, it is concluded that all gravimetric and geometrical characteristics of safflower grains were reduced due to the reduction of moisture content, except for the surface-volume ratio...|$|R

Different bauxite grain sizes, resin contents, moulding pressures and firing temperatures {{were selected for}} preparing the specimens. Simple mathematical models were used to correlate the examined properties as functions of production conditions and materials' characteristics. The proposed models were fitted on the experimental data and parameters were estimated. After data analysis, {{it was found that}} low porosity specimens are produced using high materials grain size and moulding pressure, along with firing at higher temperatures. True density did not appear to indicate significant changes for all the above parameters. Shrinkage is mainly affected by firing temperature but does not depend on moulding pressure. Increase in firing temperature increases shrinkage due to higher sintering, while high grain size leads to specimens with low shrinkage. Finally, SEM was used to observe the above mentioned phenomena. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. 2011...|$|R
