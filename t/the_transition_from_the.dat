40|$|We {{study the}} one {{dimensional}} three species monomer-monomer reaction {{model in the}} reaction controlled limit using mean-field theory and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations. The phase diagram consists of a reactive steady state bordered by three equivalent adsorbing phases where the surface is saturated with one monomer species. <b>The</b> <b>transitions</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reactive phase are all continuous, while <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> between adsorbing phases are first-order. Bicritical points occur where the reactive phase simultaneously meets two adsorbing phases. <b>The</b> <b>transitions</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reactive to an adsorbing phase show directed percolation critical behaviour, while the universal behaviour at the bicritical points is in the even branching annihilating random walk class. The results are contrasted and compared to previous results for the adsorption-controlled limit of the same model. Comment: 12 pages using RevTeX, plus 4 postscript figures.

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic—which {{took place}} with <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fourth {{to the third}} {{millennium}} BCE—witnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change {{in the style of}} monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, {{with the exception of the}} island's south-eastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed {{versions}} of songs {{can not be}} entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, {{in order to keep}} engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

5|$|Barton pursued {{his dreams}} of {{becoming}} a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at Nottingham Forest, but was rejected when it was decided he {{was too small to}} become a footballer. Barton said his rejection by clubs only made him more determined to succeed as a footballer and prove his detractors wrong. He made his first appearance for Manchester City's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him, but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season.

He was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|By 1127, Jin had conquered most of {{northern}} China and besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng twice. In the second siege of Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong of the Song was captured. The Jurchens took {{him and the}} Song royal family to Manchuria as hostages. Members of the Song court who had evaded capture fled south, where they established a temporary capital, first in the Song southern capital (modern Shangqiu), and then in Hangzhou in 1129. The move of the Song capital south to Hangzhou signals <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Northern Song era to the Southern Song. Qinzong's younger brother, Prince Zhao Gou, was enthroned as Qinzong's successor in the southern capital in 1127; he is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozong. The Jurchen general Wuzhu crossed the Yangtze River in 1130 and tried to capture Gaozong, but the Emperor escaped. Wuzhu retreated north across the Yangtze, where he fought off a stronger Song fleet commanded by Han Shizhong.|$|E

A Ming loyalist, {{he was offered}} a {{position}} at the rump court of the Hongguang Emperor, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various multi-colour printing and embossing techniques, and he employed several {{members of his family}} in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form.|$|E

5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
5|$|The Gediminid dynasty {{began its}} ascent in Lithuania {{during this time}} with the {{emergence}} of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability.

5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines except Holochilus and {{its close}} relatives, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the cusps {{extending}} {{higher than the}} central parts of the molars. They are characterized by strong cusps and absence or reduction of accessory crests. The cusps of the upper molars are opposite, but in the lower molars the labial (outer) cusps are slightly further to the front than the lingual (inner) ones. On the upper first molar, one accessory ridge, the anteroloph, is lacking, but another, the mesoloph, is present. Unlike in most other oryzomyines, however, which have mesolophs reaching the labial margin of the molar, the mesolophs of Pseudoryzomys are short and protrude only slightly {{from the middle of}} the molar. The corresponding structure in the lower molars, the mesolophid, is completely absent. The hindmost valley between cusps on the lower first molar, the posteroflexid, is severely reduced, foreshadowing its loss in Lundomys and Holochilus. A number of molar traits support Pseudoryzomyss relationship with Holochilus and Lundomys, forming steps in <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> complex, low-crowned generalized oryzomyine molar pattern to the simpler, high-crowned pattern of Holochilus.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{artefacts}} excavated {{from the}} acropolis date from <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic, when the surrounding population {{appears to have}} occupied the abandoned palace. Excavations of the south range of the acropolis uncovered a great many potsherds (roughly 11,000) dating to the Terminal Classic, and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic. In the same building 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings. Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found, including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses. One of these figurines was a whistle {{in the shape of}} an owl, identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in the acropolis courtyard. Both of these owl-shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at Yaxha. A number of artefacts were recovered from the threshold of Room 3 of the south range, including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel, a flint knife, some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments. In the area of the threshold of Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered. Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic, and a greenstone axe among other finds. Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct. Additionally, 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of the acropolis, together with stone chippings and pieces of animal bones.|$|E
5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E
