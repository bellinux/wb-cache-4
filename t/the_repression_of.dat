5|$|With {{the fall}} of Diệm, various American {{sanctions}} that were implemented against South Vietnam in response to <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> the Buddhist crisis and Nhu's Special Forces' Xá Lợi Pagoda raids, were lifted. The freeze on U.S. economic aid, the suspension of the Commercial Import Program and various capital works initiatives were lifted. The United States quickly moved to recognise Thơ and Minh.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E

5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove {{to make it clear that}} feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} effected drastic cuts to {{the military}} budget, and privatized military factories. Menem appointed Lt. Gen. Martín Balza, who had performed well during <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> Seineldín's mutiny, as the Army's General Chief of Staff (head of the military hierarchy). The death of a conscript soldier in 1994, victim of abuses by his superiors, led to the abolition of conscription in the country. The following year, Balza voiced the first institutional self-criticism {{of the armed forces}} during the Dirty War, saying that obedience did not justify the actions committed in those years.|$|E
5|$|Moondram Pirai {{depicts a}} young woman whose mental state regresses {{to that of a}} child {{following}} an accident. Sexuality and <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual tension between the protagonists. Critic K. Jeshi compares Moondram Pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like Sethu... (1999), Pithamagan (2003), Perazhagan (2004), Chandramukhi (2005), Anniyan (2005) and Ghajini (2005). When asked about the reason amnesia was chosen for a disability, Mahendra said the disorder is used as a camouflage and as an excuse to portray relationships in the film.|$|E
40|$|Expression of the Escherichia coli sdhCDAB operon {{encoding}} the succinate dehydrogenase {{complex is}} regulated {{in response to}} growth conditions, such as anaerobiosis and carbon sources. An anaerobic <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> sdhCDAB {{is known to be}} mediated by the ArcB/A two-component system and the global Fnr anaerobic regulator. While the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and Cra (formerly FruR) are known as key mediators <b>of</b> catabolite <b>repression,</b> they have been excluded from <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sdhCDAB operon. Although <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> sdhCDAB was reported to involve a mechanism dependent on the ptsG expression, the molecular mechanism underlying <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> has never been clarified. In this study, we re-examined the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sdhCDAB <b>repression</b> by glucose and found that CRP directly regulates expression of the sdhCDAB operon and that <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> this operon occurs in a cAMP-dependent manner. The levels of phosphorylated enzyme IIAGlc and intracellular cAMP on various carbon sources were proportional to the expression levels of sdhC-lacZ. Disruption of crp or cya completely abolished <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> sdhC-lacZ expression. Together with data showing correlation between the intracellular cAMP concentrations and the sdhC-lacZ expression levels in several mutants and wild type, in vitro transcription assays suggest that the decrease in the CRP·cAMP level in the presence of glucose is the major determinant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glucose <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sdhCDAB operon...|$|R

5|$|The {{indigenous}} soldiers fulfilled {{a number}} of different purposes. Initially they were collaborators in the conquest of Indochina, helping to defeat the forces of the Nguyễn Dynasty and then in its pacification. After the pacification campaign was officially completed in 1897, the two main functions of the colonial army were the maintenance of internal peace and external security. Both these tasks were fulfilled in conjunction with other armed institutions, such as the Garde indigène (later indochinoise), the gendarmerie, the police, and the irregular partisans in the border regions. The Garde indigène, a paramilitary force, was primarily responsible for dealing with disturbances of the peace and thus {{played an important role in}} <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> public demonstrations and popular unrest.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra, in his {{now defunct}} blog Moondram Pirai..., {{referred}} to the film as a suspense thriller, while N. Venkateswaran of The Times of India {{described it as a}} psychological thriller. Devika Bai, writing for the New Straits Times, referred to Moodu Pani as a whodunit film. K.Hariharan, director of the L. V. Prasad Film & TV Academy, noted that sexuality and <b>the</b> <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> desire were the dominant motifs in Moodu Pani, expressed through the mysterious misty atmospheres of Ooty where the protagonist confronts their psychological antagonist. He also noted that Moodu Pani, like many of Mahendra's films, borrowed its themes and stylistic devices from French New Wave and New Hollywood styles of filmmaking. Ilangovan noted that Chandru's character, which was depicted as having flashes of wickedness bordering on perversion, was new to Tamil cinema. Crime and detective fiction writer Pattukkottai Prabakar considers Moodu Pani, along with Sigappu Rojakkal and Nooravathu Naal (1984), to explore the personalities and behavioural traits of psychopaths in detail.|$|E

50|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>repressions</b> <b>of</b> this period, Russians outside {{official}} control produced a flowering {{of literature and}} the arts. Through the works of Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev and numerous others, Russian literature gained international stature and recognition. Ballet took root in Russia after its importation from France, and classical music became firmly established with the compositions of Mikhail Glinka (1804-1857).|$|R
