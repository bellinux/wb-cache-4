She returned to England in 1992 and {{spent the rest of}} that year in County Durham, in a house <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> over the North Sea. There she began working on her first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. In 1993, she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks, a job she kept for the next ten years.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{consists}} of two areas, the oldest around the peristyle which was built around the first century BC and the later part, probably widening or merging of an existing structure, {{dating back to the}} imperial age. The peristyle has a portico on three sides and different areas including a oecus (lost following a landslide), and several scenic areas <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> on the sea. On the west side there is a square fish pond with lead pipes and water spouts. The south side is a pseudo-portico adorned with columns resting on a wall, behind which lies the baths that includes a caldarium with a bathtub, a tepidarium also with tub and garden and a laconicum with domed roof and a kitchen. On the north side next to Ariana Villa are a triclinium, a cubiculum.|$|E
500|$|International {{reactions}} to Gaddafi's death were divided. U.S. President Barack Obama {{stated that it}} meant that [...] "the shadow of tyranny over Libya has been lifted," [...] while UK Prime Minister David Cameron stated that he was [...] "proud" [...] of his country's role in overthrowing [...] "this brutal dictator". Contrastingly, former Cuban President Fidel Castro commented that in defying the rebels, Gaddafi would [...] "enter history {{as one of the}} great figures of the Arab nations", while Venezuela's Chávez described him as [...] "a great fighter, a revolutionary and a martyr." [...] Former South African President Nelson Mandela expressed sadness at the news, praising Gaddafi for his anti-apartheid stance, remarking that he backed the African National Congress during [...] "the darkest moments of our struggle". Gaddafi was mourned as a hero by many across Sub-Saharan Africa; The Daily Times of Nigeria for instance stated that while undeniably a dictator, Gaddafi was the most benevolent in a region that only knew dictatorship, and that he was [...] "a great man <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> for his people and made them the envy of all of Africa." [...] The Nigerian newspaper Leadership reported that while many Libyans and Africans would mourn Gaddafi, this would be ignored by Western media and that as such it would take 50 years before historians decided whether he was [...] "martyr or villain." ...|$|E

500|$|Corriea {{was mixed}} about the game's HD upgrade, stating {{that while the}} {{background}} were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and the main characters moved fluidly and expressed emotion properly, NPCs or characters unimportant to the stories did not receive the same attention as the main cast. Schilling was disappointed with the result, frequently citing scenery and character behavior <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> of place on the big screen. Miller said that the game's visuals were [...] "dominated by muddy textures and frequent loading.", while he negatively noted {{the removal of the}} original's multiplayer. Damiani praised the upgrades for the main characters, but noted multiple inconsistencies in both the environments and cutscenes. Famitsu found the graphics [...] "dramatically beautiful", but found it strange seeing the original environments on a large screen. Meyerink said that, while not hard on the eyes, the upgrades were well below what he expected. Sullivan praised the lighting and shading effects, but shared Corriea's criticism of NPCs and noted low-quality environmental textures, saying she was [...] "so bored by most environments that [...] stopped caring about them halfway through the story." [...] The localized dialogue also received mixed to negative reactions, with multiple reviewers faulting the English voice actors' performances. Opinions on the PC port were mixed: Meyerink marked it as an improvement of the ports of the XIII games while acknowledging issues with the graphics and controls, while Roberts was not impressed by its performance.|$|E
2500|$|Nicholas Mikhailovich's cell was a {{large room}} with windows <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> onto the courtyard. He had a camp bed that he had brought with him. He was treated well by his jailors. The French {{government}} tried to intercede on his behalf {{as a member of}} the French Academy. Brummer, his faithful assistant, tried also to gain the grand duke's release, but he could only visit him in prison. On 20 July, Brummer informed the prisoners of Nicholas II's assassination. [...] This seemed to indicate the worst. The following day, 21 July, all of the exiled grand dukes in Vologda where transferred back to Petrograd. In the former Imperial capital, the men were quickly imprisoned with six other detainees in a cell at Cheka Headquarters.|$|E

60|$|An hour later, that evening, Florence {{was talking}} with her usual spirit to a group who were {{collected}} around her, when, suddenly looking up, she saw Elliot, standing in an abstracted manner, {{at one of the}} windows <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> into the balcony.|$|E
5000|$|Marmee Noir and her vampire/lycanthrope {{followers}} {{have been}} [...] "sleeping" [...] for centuries, for unknown reasons, in an underground tower <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> {{on a wide}} open space.

60|$|Hans saw <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of his one eye. Down {{he dropped}} upon his knees and, fumbling under the bed, brought forth {{a pair of}} soft leathern shoes, which he slipped upon the Baron's feet and then laced the thongs above the instep.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Victorian {{school was}} built in 1895 and is now used as the school hall. The current main school building {{was built in}} 1968 with new classrooms added in 1974, 1995 and 2008. The school has playing fields <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> across Otmoor.|$|R

60|$|Aunt Louisa took Philip {{upstairs and}} showed him into a tiny bed-room <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> on the drive. Immediately {{in front of the}} window was a large tree, which Philip remembered now because the {{branches}} were so low that it was possible to climb quite high up it.|$|E
60|$|The face <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> {{from this}} hood was too pale and anxious for one so young; {{and when a}} sudden gust turned the old {{umbrella}} inside out with a crash, despair fell upon poor Lizzie, {{and she was so}} miserable she could have sat down in the rain and cried.|$|E
50|$|When Lawton's Hill was {{selected}} as the site for the new Catholic high school, the cross was a prominent theme in the building's design. Windows of amber glass, facing westward, form one large cross <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> from all three floors of the building.|$|R

60|$|Stepping {{into the}} road, I first {{examined}} the Cur's {{part of the}} cottage. Not a sound was audible inside; not a creature was visible outside.

6000|$|At the {{entrance}} of the little restaurant she saw Mr. Cuthcott waiting. In a brown suit, with his pale but freckled face, and his gnawed-at, sandy moustache, and his eyes <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> and beyond, he was certainly no beauty. But Nedda thought: 'He's even nicer than I remembered, and I'm sure he knows a lot.' ...|$|E
60|$|At last, however, {{our journey}} {{came to an}} end, and I sprang ashore some five hundred paces from the little chapel, and almost exactly {{opposite}} the Château de Canaples.

50|$|In 1994, the Paris Metro {{station at}} Arts et Métiers was {{redesigned}} by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style, {{to honor the}} works of Jules Verne.

60|$|He {{turned his}} head first to the one side {{and then to the}} other; there sat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans. Two or three other {{retainers}} stood by a great window <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> into the courtyard beneath, jesting and laughing together in low tones, and one lay upon the heavy oaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he fell {{shivering}} and yawning enormously {{and wishing}} he was warmly {{tucked away in}} bed in his little flat <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> upon Sloane Street. (It didn't do even to think of Cousin Jane.) His legs became cotton strands, his feet lead. He wondered if any one would get them coffee in Hickleybrow. He had never {{been up all night}} for three-and-thirty years.|$|E
60|$|That night Nora lay {{beside her}} sisters {{in the tiny}} room <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> on the harbour. The younger girls slept soundly, but Nora kept awake {{to listen to the}} {{laughter}} of the wind outside, and con over what she and Rob had said to each other. There was no blot on her happiness save a sorry wonder what the Camerons would say when they knew.|$|E
6000|$|They loitered under trees, {{they sat}} on mossy banks they gossiped on {{friendly}} benches, they came back to lunch at the [...] "Star and Garter," [...] and talked their afternoon away in the garden <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>out</b> upon the crescent of the river. They had a universe to talk about--two universes.|$|R
60|$|When Scrooge awoke {{it was so}} dark, <b>that,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> of bed, {{he could}} {{scarcely}} distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.|$|R
50|$|The Lower School Addition, {{which houses}} pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and primer classrooms, {{opened in the}} fall of 2001.
