40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a 2 -dimensional water-filling (2 D-WF) based <b>transmit</b> {{weight that}} maximizes the channel {{capacity}} is theoretically derived for the downlink <b>transmit</b> diversity of single-carrier {{distributed antenna network}} (SC DAN) in a frequency-selective channel. The 2 D-WF <b>transmit</b> weight allocates the <b>transmit</b> power in both <b>transmit</b> antenna dimension and frequency dimension: power allocation across frequencies based on WF theory and across <b>transmit</b> antennas based on maximal ratio transmission (MRT). The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the achievable channel capacity by 2 D-WF <b>transmit</b> diversity is evaluated by the Monte-Carlo numerical computation method. Channel capacities achievable with 2 D-WF, MRT, and 1 D WF <b>transmit</b> weight are compared. It is shown that the 2 D-WF <b>transmit</b> weight provides the highest channel capacity among three <b>transmit</b> weights.

30|$|Each UE’s <b>transmit</b> {{power can}} be regulated. However, the <b>transmit</b> powers have not been {{calibrated}} as the experimental setup {{does not allow for}} such a measurement. Nevertheless, we can change the <b>transmit</b> power of the UEs by switching between predefined power amplifier (PA) <b>transmit</b> power settings, which are denoted by values from − 4 dB to − 32 dB. The PA <b>transmit</b> power setting of − 4 dB addresses the highest <b>transmit</b> power possible and equals approximately a total <b>transmit</b> power of 23 dBm at a bandwidth of 30 PRBs. Since a PA <b>transmit</b> power setting ensures a constant <b>transmit</b> power density over the complete bandwidth that is allocated, the total UE <b>transmit</b> power changes when changing the bandwidth of the UE. In order to decrease the receive power of UE 0 even more than it is possible with the <b>transmit</b> power, we add a fixed 20 dB attenuator for this UE’s UL transmission (see Fig. 2).|$|R

5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to <b>transmitting</b> two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their <b>transmitting</b> power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts {{have been given a}} lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped <b>transmitting</b> for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted.

40|$|Questions: Can {{vertically}} <b>transmitted</b> parasites (VTPs) {{serve as}} indirect mutualists by excluding more virulent, horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasites (HTPs) ? How does {{the efficiency of}} vertical transmission affect: (1) the equilibrium number of hosts infected by each type of parasite; (2) {{the total number of}} hosts in the population; and (3) virulence of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite? How does reproductive output by the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite affect the frequency of infection by both parasite types? Methods and assumptions: We used a deterministic computer simulation to determine host-population dynamics following introduction of a vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite. We assumed that the vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite precludes infection by the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite. We allowed for the possibility that virulence of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite depends on host density. Conclusions: Vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasites can serve as indirect mutualists by excluding more virulent horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasites. As such, selection would be expected to favour VTP strains that most efficiently exclude horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasites. In addition, the total number of hosts at equilibrium increases (and HTP frequency decreases) with the efficiency of vertical transmission. Increasing the reproductive output of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite has little effect on the frequency of that parasite at equilibrium, but greatly increases the frequency of hosts infected with the vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite. When virulence of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite is density dependent, the vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite indirectly increases virulence by increasing host density at equilibrium...|$|R

Additionally, we show that the FDD <b>transmit</b> matched filter is a type of Eigenbeamforming. The simulation results reveal the excellent performance of the two FDD <b>transmit</b> filters.
