5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

5|$|Urban design {{management}} involves mediation among {{a range of}} self-interested stakeholders engaged {{in the production of}} <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment.</b> Such mediation can encourage a joint search for mutually beneficial outcomes or integrative development. Integrative development aims to produce sustainable solutions by increasing stakeholder satisfaction with the process and with the resulting urban development.|$|E

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately {{may lead to a}} tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Japan has a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection {{is typical of}} Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public display of the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment,</b> which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Salford's built {{environment}} {{is made up}} of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> is poor.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> around Coatbridge's {{town centre}} is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century {{sandstone}} buildings and late twentieth-century precast concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E
5|$|The work on Integrative Negotiation Consensus Building and the Mutual Gains Approach {{provide a}} helpful {{theoretical}} framework {{for developing the}} theory of urban design management. Negotiation theory provides a useful framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment.</b> Interests, a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981), Getting to yes, advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.|$|E

40|$|Does {{the widely}} {{documented}} tendency to prefer natural over <b>built</b> <b>environments</b> owe to <b>the</b> perception of greater restorative potential in natural environments? In the present experimental study {{we tested the}} mediating role of restoration in environmental preferences. Participants viewed a frightening movie, and then were shown a video of either a natural or a <b>built</b> <b>environment.</b> We used two examples of each type of environment. Participants' mood ratings were assessed before and after they viewed the frightening movie, and again after viewing the environmental video. Participants also rated {{the beauty of the}} environment shown (to indicate preference) and performed a test of concentration after viewing the environmental video. The results indicate that participants perceived the natural environments as more beautiful than <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environments.</b> In addition, viewing natural environments elicited greater improvement in mood and marginally better concentration than viewing <b>built</b> <b>environments.</b> Mediational analyses revealed that affective restoration accounted for a substantial proportion of the preference for the natural over <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environments.</b> Together, these results help substantiate the adaptive function of people's environmental preferences.

5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> {{to create and}} preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment,</b> including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer toner. Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in <b>the</b> <b>built</b> <b>environment</b> other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E
