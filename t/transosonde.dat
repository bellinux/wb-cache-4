50|$|On September 7, 1956, the University of Minnesota {{launched}} a giant Mylar balloon (developed by the G. T. Schejeldahl Corporation of Northfield, MN) {{to set an}} unofficial balloon altitude record of 145000 ft for unmanned balloons. In 1957 the US Navy began an operational aerology system known as <b>Transosonde</b> (trans-ocean sounding), consisting of almost daily balloon flights across the Pacific Ocean from Japan.|$|E
40|$|FLIGHTS Routine Navy-sponsored 300 -mb. <b>transosonde</b> {{flights from}} Japan for the months September 1957 -February 1958 are analyzed. Statistics {{on the wind}} velocity, acceleration, and power spectra for the flights are indicated. With the aid of {{radiosonde}} data, the mean vertical motions and mean horizontal divergences along the flights are evaluated. Comparisons of <b>transosonde</b> velocities with geostrophic velocities obtained from Yational Weather Analysis Center map 8 are presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|A climatological {{analysis}} {{is made of}} Navy-sponsored 300 -mb. and 250 -mb. constant-level balloon (<b>transosonde)</b> flights launched from Iwakuni, Japan, between September 1957 and April 1959. Since the <b>transosonde</b> naturally provides information in a Lagrangian frame of reference, treated are the trajectories and trajectory dispersion, the magnitudes and periodicities of the velocity and ageostrophic velocity components derived from the trajectories, and the separation between pairs of transosondes {{as a function of}} time after their release. In addition to the research benefits, the usefulness of transosondes in providing routine upper-wind data over the oceans is pointed out...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} people to use weather {{balloons}} was LÃ©on Teisserenc de Bort, the French meteorologist. Starting in 1896 he launched hundreds of weather balloons from his observatory in Trappes, France. These experiments led to his discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere. [...] <b>Transosondes,</b> weather balloons with instrumentation meant to stay at a constant altitude {{for long periods of time}} to help diagnose radioactive debris from atomic fallout, were experimented with in 1958.|$|R
50|$|A {{weather or}} {{sounding}} balloon is a balloon (specifically {{a type of}} high-altitude balloon) which carries instruments aloft to send back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed {{by means of a}} small, expendable measuring device called a radiosonde. To obtain wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System, GPS). Balloons meant to stay at a constant altitude {{for long periods of time}} are known as <b>transosondes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Trajcctory {{configurations}} {{resulting from}} the passage of <b>transosondes</b> through regions of inertial (dynamic) instability are considered. It is shown that cusped trajectorics and trajectories with small anticyclonic loops occur downstream from such regions, with the particu 1 :tr trajectory configuration most likely dependent upon {{the magnitude of the}} pressure gradient in thc area where the transosondc velocit,y approaclles zero. The large geostrophic departures existing in, and downstream from, regions of itwrtial instability make conventional trajectory estimations within such regions difficult,, if not impossible. Cases are discusscd wherein there is evidence that large ageostrophic flows associated with regions of inertial instability are prccursors of char 1 gc. s ill prc'ssure pattern. 1...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of wind speeds and {{accelerations}} derived from U. S. Navy sponsored 300 -mb. constant level balloon or <b>transosonde</b> flights made during 1953, 1955, and 1956, statistics are presented on {{the magnitude of the}} ageostrophic wind and its variation with latitude and wind speed. These qtatistics indicate that at 300 mb. the average angle between wind and geostrophic wind is 11 degrees,and the mean magnitude of the vector deviation between wind and geostrophic wind is 12 m. see. -'. The data also show that, through the use of the geostrophic and gradient wind approximations, half the time errors greater than 29 percent and 11 percent, respectively, are introduced into the derived results. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparatively}} unbiased set of wind statistics at jet-stream level from Japan eastward to the 180 th meridian may {{be obtained}} from the United States Navy constant level balloon (<b>transosonde)</b> flights launched from Japan in 1957 - 59. Wind speeds so derived are presented as a function of time of year and longitude at pressure surfaces of 300 and 250 mb. At these longitudes and heights the average speed is 103 kt. in fall, 123 kt. in winter, and 101 kt. in spring. A comparison with mean meridional cross sections indicates that at these levels in this area of the northwestern Pacific the mean wind speed heretofore may have been underestimated by an amount exceeding 25 kt. Since the days of World War 11, when United States bombers found themselves practically flying backwards over Japan, meteorologists have realized that the strongest tropospheric winds in the Northern Hemisphere (and perhaps in the world) occur over and to the east of Japan during the winter season [I]. It is not yet certain to what degree this {{is a reflection of the}} thermal wind resulting from large land-sea temperature differences on the eas...|$|E
