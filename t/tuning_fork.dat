5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b> He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{keyboard}} musical instruments using constructions similar to <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> have been made, {{the most popular}} of them being the Rhodes piano, which has hammers hitting constructions working on the same principle as <b>tuning</b> <b>forks</b> and uses electric amplification of the generated sound.

He began his experiments in 1873-1874 with a harmonic telegraph, following {{the examples of}} Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> to vibrate.|$|E
25|$|Many musicians {{have quite}} good {{relative}} pitch, {{a skill that}} can be learned through ear training. With practice, {{it is possible to}} listen to a single known pitch once (from a pitch pipe or a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork)</b> and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch. Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived tonal center.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> {{can be held}} {{near the}} mouth of a long pipe which is dipping into a barrel of water. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to {{resonance}} if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to (1 + 2n)λ/4 where n is an integer. As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.|$|E

25|$|The phonautograph, {{patented}} by Léon Scott in 1857, used a vibrating diaphragm and stylus to graphically record sound waves as tracings on sheets of paper, purely for visual analysis {{and without any}} intent of playing them back. In the 2000s, these tracings were first scanned by audio engineers and digitally converted into audible sound. Phonautograms of singing and speech made by Scott in 1860 were played back as sound {{for the first time}} in 2008. Along with a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> tone and unintelligible snippets recorded as early as 1857, these are the earliest known recordings of sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork.</b> The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
500|$|Along with {{a talking}} drum, Badu used tuning forks when {{recording}} New Amerykah Part One to evoke a certain feeling through its frequency, a practice {{she had done}} on her previous albums: [...] "Each <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> has a certain vibrational energy that is conducive to a feeling or a color or a smell. They're related to different chakras in the body, too. Some may {{make you feel good}} or sexy or conscious of what you're saying." [...] The album was mastered at Electric Lady Studios in February 2008. Before it was edited down to 11 tracks, New Amerykah Part One was originally intended as a double album, with 18 songs over two discs.|$|E

25|$|The fifth string (A2) is {{tuned to}} 110Hz, exactly two octaves below the {{standard}} orchestral reference pitch of 440 Hz (A440). <b>Tuning</b> <b>forks</b> and electronic tuners that match these frequencies are commonly available, so a properly tuned fifth string {{can provide a}} reference to tune the remaining strings by ear. <b>Tuning</b> <b>forks</b> which provide the pitch of the high E string (329.63Hz) are also common.|$|R
500|$|The Rhodes piano {{features}} a keyboard {{with a similar}} layout to a traditional acoustic piano, but some models contain 73 keys instead of 88. The touch and action of the keyboard {{is designed to be}} as close to a piano as possible. Pressing a key results in a hammer striking a thin metal rod called a tine connected to a larger [...] "tone bar". The whole [...] "tone generator assembly" [...] acts as a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork,</b> the tone bar reinforcing and extending the vibrations of the tine. A pickup sits opposite the tine, picking up its vibrations and inducing an electric current in a similar manner to an electric guitar. The basic mechanical act of hitting tines does not need an external power supply, and a Rhodes will make sound even when not plugged into an amplifier, though like an unplugged electric guitar the sound will be weak.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Faraday (1831) was {{the first}} to notice {{oscillations}} of one frequency being excited by forces of double the frequency, in the crispations (ruffled surface waves) observed in a wine glass excited to [...] "sing". Franz Melde (1860) generated parametric oscillations in a string by employing a <b>tuning</b> <b>fork</b> to periodically vary the tension at twice the resonance frequency of the string.

2500|$|Derived units {{which are}} formed by {{operating}} on base units or combinations of base units and other derived units.

In pure superfluid in the zero temperature limit, three distinct critical velocities were observed with both <b>tuning</b> <b>forks.</b> We discuss the signicance of all critical velocities and associate the third critical velocity reported {{here for the first}} time with the development of large vortical structures in the flow, which thus starts to mimic turbulence in classical fluids.
