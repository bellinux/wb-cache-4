Navy and Marine Corps to reduce energy usage. This study explores how to optimize placement {{and size of}} a non-intrusive waste heat recovery device for energy recovery in exhaust ducts. Additionally, it explores the effect that a device has on the exhaust infrared signature by analyzing {{the change in the}} bulk temperature at the exhaust outlet. Optimal device placement and size is dependent on duct geometry, external heat transfer coefficient, and flow characteristics, namely Reynolds number. Infrared signature intensity reductions of 1 – 14 % are only achievable with unpractically long <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> <b>devices</b> and high external heat transfer coefficients. Doubling the external heat transfer coefficient increases heat recovery by 15 – 30 % for low Reynolds number flows (104) and 75 – 90 % for high Reynolds number flows (105 ~ 106). In low Reynolds number flows (~ 104), device position can account for a 75 % change in energy recovery whereas high Reynolds number flows (~ 106) have unexpected areas of higher heat transfer. Position changes can increase heat recovery 10 – 70 %, while increasing device size may only marginally improve results. Identifying local maxima for heat transfer, especially in high Reynolds number flows (~ 106), is counterintuitive because of unexpected recirculation zone effects.

40|$|To achieve high thermal-to-electric energy {{conversion}} efficiency, {{it is desirable}} to operate <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> <b>devices</b> over large temperature gradients and also to maximize the thermoelectric performance of the materials used to build the devices. However, no single thermoelectric material is suitable for use over a very wide range of temperatures (approx. 300 - 1000 K). It is therefore necessary to use different materials in each temperature range where they possess optimum performance. This can be achieved in two ways: 1) multistage thermoelectric generators where each stage operates over a fixed temperature difference and is electrically insulated but thermally {{in contact with the}} other stages and 2) segmented generators where the p- and n-legs are formed of different segments joined in series. The concept of integrating new thermoelectric materials developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) into a segmented thermoelectric generator has been presented in detail in earlier publications. This new generator is expected to operate over a 300 - 973 K temperature difference and will use novel segmented legs based on a combination of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials and novel p-type Zn 4 Sb 3, p-type CeFe 4 Sb 12 -based alloys and n-type CoSb 3 -based alloys. An increase in the conversion efficiency of about 60 % is expected compared to conventional Bi 2 Te 3 - and PbTe-based generators. We present in this paper the latest experimental results from the bonding studies between the different segments of the p-legs, n-legs, and p-leg to n-leg interconnect. Evaluation of the bond quality was done by measuring the contact resistance across the joints as well as by detailed microstructure investigations to reveal any potential interdiffusion. Among the materials investigated as inter-layers between the different segments of the legs, Pd-Ag joining alloys have been found to provide mechanically stable and low electrical resistance bonds...|$|E

The established thermoelectric materials are composed of rare, toxic and expensive elements, like Pb, Sb, and Te. Extension of use requires not only the development of thermoelectric materials consisting of non-hazardous and inexpensive elements, but also new manufacturing technologies for large devices.

In current energy efficient building practice, windows are considerably less well insulating component than {{other parts of the}} building envelope. Therefore improving windows thermal performance is an important issue to develop energy efficiency building design. This research is carried out from the case studies of zero/low carbon buildings, in which windows were found the weakest part of building envelope. Within this work state-of-the-art window glazing types, latest best performing fenestration products in the market and advanced window technologies are reviewed. Vacuum window technology using evacauted tube pannels will be presented in this research work, as well as Thermoelectric (TEC) window system and Thermoelectric power generation window system. The objectives of the development of novel window systems are: (1) to develop the first-of-its-kind window technology using evacuated tube panels, its thermal transmittance (U-value) will be studied; (2) In order to compare U-values data with high performance windows, thermal performance of novel designed Aerogel and argon window system will be investigated; (3) to develop novel window system by combining evacuated tube panels and thermoelectric modules, which is functioned as a heat pump device; (4) to develop window system as a power generation <b>device</b> by interating <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator.</b> Novel windows technologies would meet the requirements of the Code for Sustainable Homes and those of commercial buildings.

Economic and environmental assessments are also analysed. (2) Numerical model and laboratory tests have illustrated the U-values of different thickness of aerogel, argon and combination of both filled window. Comparing to standard double glazed window unit with 20 mm air gap (U-value of 2. 8 W/m 2 K), the U-value result of 6 mm Aerogel-Argon window can be improved by 45 % in theory and 30 % according to the laboratory measurement results.

40|$|A <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> (TEG) <b>device</b> {{which uses}} solar energy as heat source would achieve higher {{efficiency}} {{if there is}} a higher temperature difference between the hot-cold ends. However, higher temperature or higher heat flux being imposed upon the hot end will cause strong thermal stress, which will have a negative influence on the life cycle of the thermoelectric module. Meanwhile, in order to get high heat flux, a Fresnel lens is required to concentrate solar energy, which will cause non-uniformity of heat flux on the hot end of the TEG and further influence the thermal stress of the device. This phenomenon is very common in solar TEG devices but seldom research work has been reported. In this paper, numerical analysis on the heat transfer and thermal stress performance of a TEG module has been performed considering the variation on the power of the heat flux being imposed upon the hot-end; the influence of non-uniform high heat flux on thermal stress has also been analyzed. It is found that non-uniformity of high heat flux being imposed upon the hot end has a significant effect on the thermal stress of TEG and life expectation of the device. Taking the uniformity of 100 % as standard, when the heating uniformity is 70 %, 50 %, 30 %, and 10 %, respectively, the maximum thermal stress of TEG module increased by 3 %, 6 %, 12 %, and 22 % respectively.

However, these devices are reaching not to a physical limit but a power limit, which is a critical limit for further miniaturization to develop smaller and smarter wearable/implantable devices (WIDs), especially for multi-task continuous computing purposes.

However, batteries have a fixed energy density, limited lifetime and chemical side effect plus {{the fact that the}} total size of the WID is dominated by the battery size.
