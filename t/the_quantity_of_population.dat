40|$|This study employs Hansen's (2000) {{threshold}} {{regression analysis}} {{to examine the}} relationship between population growth and per capita GDP in 117 countries. Threshold regression analysis allows controlling the quality of population when examining the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> and per capita income in a country. The paper uses Human Development Index (HDI) value as the threshold regression variable. In the course of the analysis, a sample of 117 countries was split twice and separated into four sub-samples. The threshold regression analysis revealed that there was a significant negative relationship between population growth and per capita GDP only in the countries with a low level of human development. In other words, quantitative expansion of population would have negative impact on standard of living only in the countries with low quality of population. The empirical findings of this paper support a proposition that the quality of population aspect should be included in the debate on the relationship between population expansion and economic development...|$|E

These kinds of rates are accurate in the early time of the outbreak of infectious diseases or <b>the</b> low <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>population,</b> and <b>the</b> dynamics properties are relatively simple. For example, Huo and Dang [2] studied a TB model with bilinear incidence rate and different incubations.

The results show that provinces with higher EFF are mainly concentrate in the Middle Eastern China, which have a developed industry, such as Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning Province and so on. However, provinces with lower EFF mainly concentrated in Western China, which have a relatively lag economy, such as Ningxia, Qinghai province and so on.

40|$|Demographic and {{economic}} statistics are usually published for each country separately; this practice, however, restricts their significance. Of course, {{there is nothing}} untrue in stating that the world’s five most populated countries contain half the world’s population, or that the five wealthiest countries account for about 60 % of the world’s GNP (see table 1). Yet, if countries were replaced by continental expanses or economic unions such as the European Union (EU), the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA), etc., the resulting picture would be quite different. Thus, in 1997, the EU’s global GNP (1) exceeded that of the United States (8, 598 and 7, 924 billion dollars, respectively).

40|$|Radioactive and {{transgenic}} tracing experiments {{indicate that}} the adult adrenal cortex is maintained by a common pool of stem cells, which reside in {{the periphery of the}} adrenal cortex in the subcapsular zone. For repopulation, adrenal progenitor cells migrate towards the organ center, where they differentiate within the different specialized adrenocortical zones and take over specific adrenocortical functions. However, isolation and detailed investigation of adrenal progenitor cells has been hampered by the lack of known marker genes. There is convincing data that utilizing the side population, which is based on Hoechst 33342 dye exclusion, leads to an enrichment of progenitor or stem cells in the hematopoietic system and multiple other tissues. In the absence of known stem cell marker genes, we employed the side population technique on adrenal cells. In contrast to non-side population cells, side population cells readily grew over several passages in vitro. Furthermore, after 4 weeks in culture, immunohistochemistry revealed steroidogenic enzyme expression, suggesting spontaneous differentiation. Microarray analysis was performed and showed that the two populations clearly differed on the mRNA level. However, none of the genes analyzed presented with a substantially higher expression level to be considered a valuable adrenal stem cell marker candidate. Interestingly, <b>the</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> side <b>population</b> cells was significantly diminished in the context of Pbx 1 haploinsufficiency. This transgenic mouse model is associated with smaller adrenal glands, a lower adrenal proliferation rate, and impaired adrenal function, suggesting a stem cell deficit in these animals. In contrast, Tpit-/- mice, which are ACTH-deficient, presented with a subcapsular zone width, which was significantly enlarged in comparison to wild type adrenals. Accordingly, the number <b>of</b> side <b>population</b> cells in these mice was significantly higher. ACTH treatment of these animals not only reverted the subcapsular zone width back to normal, but also resulted in a reduction <b>of</b> the side <b>population</b> fraction to a level similar to that of wild type animals, providing indirect evidence for a stem cell ‘arrest’ in the state of ACTH deficiency. Overall, adrenal side population cells seem to be enriched with progenitor cells with a rather differentiated or designated phenotype. To define the characteristics of multipotent versus somatic adrenal stem cells, a fusion model was established. Herein, PEG mediated cell fusion between murine adult adrenal and embryonic stem cells was performed, however, did not render the expected spectrum of progenitor cells. The involvement of stem cell like cancer cells in adrenal tumorigenesis was assessed by identifying the side population in different human adrenal tumor entities and in the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI H 295 R. The latter were analyzed further and characterized, however, a tumor stem cell-like behavior could not be detected: NCI H 295 R side population cells had no greater contribution to tumor growth compared to the other cells and had no survival benefit upon exposure to chemotherapeutic substances, typically administered in this tumor entity. Therefore, identifying side population cells does not per se guarantee stemness, and should always result in further extensive investigations. ...|$|R
