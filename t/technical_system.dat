25|$|Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {{analysis}} involves {{creating an}} inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the <b>technical</b> <b>system</b> is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities {{that are going to}} be assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives a clear picture of the <b>technical</b> <b>system</b> boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).|$|E

All bouts on French soil recorded as Mixed Martial Arts {{are in fact}} held under Pancrase Rules and other variants (Pankration, Kempo, Pankido). These bouts involve no striking {{on the ground as}} it is illegal in the country. The Commission National de Mixed Martial Arts (CNMMA) was founded as a non-profit organization for the development of MMA in 2009. The CNMMA had worked over four years to put an educational structure in place, including a <b>technical</b> <b>system</b> for the safe progression from grass-roots level, {{all the way up to}} the top professional level. Comprising 11 regional leagues working under regional technical advisers and teams, the CNMMA joined the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation (IMMAF) in March 2013 as The Commission Française de Mixed Martial Arts (CFMMA). In 2012, CFMMA president Bertrand Amoussou ascended to the position of President of the International Mixed Martial Arts Federation.|$|E

Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was [...] "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a <b>technical</b> <b>system</b> of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," [...] further adding [...] "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people. [...] If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share your vision of what law stands for. [...] That's why the SOPA protests were so effective.
