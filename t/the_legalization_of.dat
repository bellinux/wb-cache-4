5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes {{proposed}} a freeway along the US 40 corridor {{in order to}} alleviate increased traffic along that route following <b>the</b> <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, {{which was to be}} maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, the {{shipyard}} workers began their strike, {{organized by the}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża).

5|$|Seattle {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of the most liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing its neighbor, Portland, Oregon.

In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve <b>the</b> <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> the recreational use of cannabis in the state. Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.|$|E

5|$|Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The {{critical}} {{success of}} the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson {{one of the most}} recognized artists in country music. He {{was one of the main}} figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and <b>the</b> <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> marijuana.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with <b>the</b> <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E
40|$|Steinhoff (On {{the ethics}} of torture. SUNY Press, Albany, 2013) defends the moral and legal {{permissibility}} of torture in a limited range of circumstances. This article criticizes Steinhoff’s arguments. The analogy between ordinary defensive violence and defensive torture which Steinhoff argues for is partly spoiled by the presence, within defensive torture, of opportunistic harm, in addition to eliminative harm. Steinhoff’s arguments that <b>the</b> mere <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> defensive torture would not metastasize into a more full-fledged institutionalization of torture are also found wanting. As a minimal form <b>of</b> institutionalization, <b>the</b> mere <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> torture would already be at risk of further entrenchment and growth...|$|R

5|$|In 1773, in the {{aftermath}} of the War of the Bar Confederation, a special session of the Sejm (Polish parliament) was convened in Warsaw, capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by its three neighbours (Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria) in order to legalize their First Partition of Poland. That Sejm became known as the Partition Sejm. Rejtan was one of the deputies that tried to prevent <b>the</b> <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> the first partition of Poland, despite threats from the foreign ambassadors. For example, Russian ambassador, Otto von Stackelberg, declared that in the face of refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed by the Russians; other threats included executions, confiscation of estates, and increase of partitioned territory.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting <b>the</b> <b>legalization</b> <b>of</b> cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E
