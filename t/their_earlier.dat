5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed the opinion that the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> releases.|$|E
5|$|Aware of Simonsohn's {{critical}} {{analyses of}} <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> methods, Pelham and Mauricio published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations whose titles matched their surnames, for example, baker, carpenter, and farmer.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the 1st and 2nd centuries, the 3rd and 4th centuries saw {{much greater}} {{fortification}} activity, with many new forts built. Later Roman fortifications, both new and upgraded old ones, contained much stronger defensive features than <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> counterparts. In addition, the late 3rd/4th centuries saw the fortification of many {{towns and cities}} including the City of Rome itself and its eastern sister, Constantinople.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>their</b> <b>earliest</b> days, {{the band}} sold drugs {{to survive and}} {{purchase}} instruments. Furthermore, the name [...] "Dope" [...] refers to drugs and drug culture, as shown by <b>their</b> <b>early</b> T-shirt designs, which prominently displayed hypodermic needles.|$|R
50|$|Mastodon's musical {{style has}} evolved much from <b>their</b> <b>earliest</b> pre-Remission {{releases}} to The Hunter. <b>Their</b> <b>early</b> work is significantly heavier and more abrasive than their later work, primarily or exclusively using harsh vocals, more distorted instruments, and more atypical song structures; {{this is especially}} prominent in <b>their</b> <b>earliest</b> work. The release of Mastodon's third studio album Blood Mountain, which incorporates both clean and harsh vocals, marked {{a shift in the}} vocal styles used, with subsequent albums favouring clean vocals almost exclusively.|$|R

5|$|During <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> {{exploration}} of the Cape, the Pilgrims had come upon a Native American burial site which contained corn, and they had taken the corn for future planting. On another occasion, they found an unoccupied house and had taken corn and beans, for which they made restitution with the occupants about six months later.|$|E
5|$|Hairway to Steven {{was issued}} in April, and marked a midway point between the band's {{experimental}} roots, {{and the more}} accessible recordings that would follow. While half of the material is as extreme sounding as <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> work, other songs are more conventional. This was the first Butthole Surfers album to make extensive use of acoustic guitar. Hairway to Steven did not have song titles when first released, and instead represented each track with an absurdist, often scatological, cartoon. The band traveled widely {{in support of the}} album over the next year, including a very successful tour of Europe (helped in part by the influence of new UK distributor Blast First). Like their studio recordings, their live shows were beginning to lose much of <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> chaos.|$|E
5|$|The Whigs {{nominated}} Dixon {{for governor}} in 1851. The Democrats countered with Lazarus Powell. Still friends from <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> days as law partners, the two often traveled together during the campaign. Cassius Marcellus Clay also entered the contest, representing the emancipationist wing of the Whig Party. Clay drew about 6,000 votes, mostly from Whigs, and Powell won the election by a small majority.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years, Scorn {{is often}} {{associated}} with industrial and experimental music, particularly with <b>their</b> <b>early</b> releases as a duo with much of their Earache Records-era output since 1991 until 1994. Since the departure of Bullen in 1995, much of the output has been minimalist beats with an emphasis on very deep bass lines, often resembling dub and trip hop in structure. The departure from <b>their</b> <b>early</b> sound eventually led to Harris parting ways with Earache after the Logghi Barogghi release, both sides apparently having been unhappy with how the project was being handled.|$|R

5|$|The band {{recorded}} the song {{during the final}} week of the Mogwai Young Team sessions from July to August 1997 at MCM Studios, in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, where the band had previously {{recorded the}} majority of <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> material. The song was produced and mixed by Paul Savage, who handled production and mixing duties on {{the bulk of the}} band's previous recordings.|$|E
5|$|The cathedrals {{fall into}} three {{distinct}} groups, depending on <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> organisational structure. Firstly, {{there are those}} that, during the Medieval period as now, were governed by a body of secular clergy or chapter, presided over by a dean. These cathedrals are Chichester, Exeter, Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln, London, Salisbury, Wells, and York, all of which built specifically to serve as cathedral churches.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E

During {{the same period}} Super Furry Animals formed and Ieuan left Catatonia to focus on them.|$|R
50|$|Apocryphon: Electro Roots 1982-1985 is a 2-CD {{compilation}} album by the synthpop band Information Society.

5|$|During the film's production, four of {{the leads}} became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to {{shooting}} delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By {{the time of the}} film's release, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him {{to spend more time with}} her. The couple married five years after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Ecstasy is {{the second}} mini album by the {{alternative}} rock band My Bloody Valentine, released on 23November 1987on Lazy Records. Released in a limited edition of 3,000copies, it was the band's final release for Lazy Records and second to feature vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, who was recruited in April 1987following the departure of original My Bloody Valentine vocalist David Conway. Ecstasy followed the noise pop and twee pop standards of My Bloody Valentine's earlier releases for the label, drawing influence from various artists including The Jesus and Mary Chain, Love and The Byrds, and the album distanced the band further from <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> post-punk and gothic rock sound.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over {{the choice of a}} subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E

In 2012, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Cavanaugh's ruling and remanded the case to him with instructions that he was to allow Heffernan to present his freedom of association claim and consider the facts from the jury trial when reconsidering the summary-judgment motions.|$|E
5|$|On 23/24/25 July 2013, White Lies played 3 {{intimate}} {{shows at}} Hoxton Square Bar & Kitchen in London, celebrating the 5 year {{anniversary of the}} band's first ever gig at the same venue. They played tracks from Big TV and some of <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> songs in front of 300 fans each night. During their Summer/Fall 2013 tour, the band is scheduled to play more than thirty concerts in Europe and North America. In August 2013 they made their Main Stage debut at Reading and Leeds Festivals.|$|E

Ed was brought to a burn center in Philadelphia where the ergot {{chemicals}} were found in his blood; it was also in Scully's blood, but not enough to cause hallucinations. Mulder wonders if this all happened because of <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> argument, to which Scully replies that not everything is about him.|$|E

5|$|Taylor apprised President McKinley of the {{situation}} in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 EP Instant 0 in the Universe was {{recorded}} in France, and was Stereolab's first release following Hansen's death. According to music journalist Jim DeRogatis, the EP marked a return to <b>their</b> <b>earlier,</b> harder sound—"free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O'Rourke". That year, Sadier's side-project, Monade, released its debut album Socialisme Ou Barbarie: The Bedroom Recordings. Both {{the name of the}} group and the title of the album are references to the work of Greek-French intellectual Cornelius Castoriadis.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese forces, however, {{were also}} {{suffering}} from logistics problems and exhaustion after <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> victories. Arguing against the Third Phase Campaign on December 7, PVA Commander Peng Dehuai telegraphed to Mao that the PVA would {{need at least}} three months to replace its casualties, while most of its troops were in critical need of resupply, rest and reorganization. The Chinese logistics system, {{which was based on}} the concept of People's War with the native population supplying the army, also ran into difficulties due to the indifferent, and sometimes hostile, Korean population near the 38th parallel. The Chinese were now suffering from hunger and the lack of winter clothing.|$|E
