5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through <b>this</b> <b>complex,</b> four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to a deepening low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda.

Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. <b>This</b> <b>complex</b> neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
