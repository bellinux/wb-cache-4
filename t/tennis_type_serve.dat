40|$|Attentional and {{vigilance}} deficits {{were investigated}} among hypothetically schizotypal college students {{using a different}} version of the continuous performance test (CPT). Subjects were undergraduate college students at a large midwestern university and were selected for participation on the CPT according to Mr 1 P I profile types. The 2 - 7 - 8 and 8 - 9 profile <b>types</b> <b>served</b> as the schizotypal groups, the 4 - 9 profile <b>type</b> <b>served</b> as the psychiatric control group, and the "inflation-free" profile <b>type</b> <b>served</b> as the normal control group. The 8 - 9 profile type was employed to further {{support the use of}} this profile type as an additional indicator of schizotypy. The CPT task employed a response-reversal technique in responding to stimuli which demanded three levels of processing. Signal detection indices were applied to false alarm rates and hit rates to obtain overall sensitivity level (d') and response criterion level (13). It was hypothesized that the 2 - 7 - 8 and 8 - 9 groups should display similar deficits on d' further supporting the use of the 8 - 9 group as an additional indicator of schizotypy and further supporting a deficit on d' as being a possible trait marker of the schizophrenic state. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between groups on any of the measures; however, group trends indicated that the 2 - 7 - 8 group obtained the highest d', contradicting previous research.

40|$|We {{compared}} the serve toss of different <b>types</b> of <b>serve</b> when <b>tennis</b> players served from the ad-court. They used different {{spin on the}} ball and various ball placements in the opponent’s service box. Our aim was to compare the toss in different <b>types</b> of <b>serve</b> between a competitive (local tournament) player and a professional player, {{from the point of}} view of the receiving player, when they served from the ad-court. One professional and one competitive tennis player (both right handed) were observed while <b>serving</b> different <b>types</b> of <b>serve</b> to various locations of the opponent’s service box. We used a high-speed camera, which was placed opposite to the server in the position of a receiving player. The results showed that the players do not use the same toss for each <b>type</b> of <b>serve.</b> The professional player had a bigger range of racket-ball contact point on horizontal axis (32 cm) of the various <b>types</b> of first <b>serves,</b> compared to the competitive player (only 24 cm). The toss of the kick serve had similar characteristics between both players (the racket-ball contact point was observed to be mostly to the right, from the view of receiver). Neither the professional nor the competitive player showed a stable profile of toss. In some cases, the receiving players could anticipate the <b>type</b> of the <b>serve</b> from the server’s toss...|$|R
