She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues <b>this</b> <b>any</b> further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unknown}} {{when the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} across the Avon in Bristol, but the first stone bridge, Bristol Bridge, {{was built in the}} 13th century. It had houses with shopfronts built on it to pay for its maintenance. A 17th-century illustration shows that these bridge houses were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. In the 1760s a bill to replace the bridge was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. By the early 18th century, increase in traffic and the encroachment of shops on the roadway made the bridge fatally dangerous for many pedestrians. A new bridge, designed by James Bridges and finished by Thomas Paty was built in 1763 and 1768. Resentment at the tolls exacted to cross the new bridge occasioned the Bristol Bridge Riot of 1793. Other crossings were considered, but were restricted by Admiralty rules that stipulated that any bridge had to be at least [...] above the water to allow the passage of tall-masted warships, to Bristol Harbour. To achieve <b>this,</b> <b>any</b> bridge constructed between Bristol Bridge and Avon Gorge, from Hotwells to Ashton Gate, would require massive embankments and viaducts. The alternative was to build across the narrowest point of the Avon Gorge, well above the height required for shipping.|$|E
500|$|... "To do <b>this</b> <b>any</b> {{other way}} {{would have been}} needlessly contentious," [...] Daley {{explained}} {{at a news conference}} Monday morning. Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago's high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center. Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying [...] "Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can't believe that. They get it first before we get it?", referring to the post-9/11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando, Florida. [...] "The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field," [...] according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn. [...] "He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could," [...] Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote of Daley. [...] "The issue is Daley's increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise or any of that messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government," [...] the Chicago Tribune editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the City for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000, the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, {{in spite of the fact}} that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} take action against the militias, the local British {{commander}} in South East Iraq developed a plan to conduct aggressive operations against them. At the same time Stirrup became increasingly concerned that strong political leadership from the Iraqis was lacking and that without <b>this</b> <b>any</b> gains made by the military actions against the militias would be to no avail. [...] In July 2006, Stirrup overturned the previous military advice to the Defence Secretary by stating that force levels in South East Iraq would need to be maintained.

[...] In September 2006, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, blocked the British plan to act against the militias which Stirrup believed was because of Maliki's dependence on Sadrist support at that stage.|$|E

(...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia." [...] Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the Islamist [...] "North Caucasian Emirate".|$|E
