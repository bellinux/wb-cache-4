5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before the industrial revolution, {{but it was}} not until after the industrial revolution that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. The industrial revolution changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After the industrial revolution, large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to grasp <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> Canada's oil sands and heavy oil resource. Fields in northern Alberta include four major deposits which underlie almost 70,000 square kilometres of land. The volume of bitumen in those sands dwarfs the light oil reserves of the entire Middle East. One of those deposits, the Athabasca oil sands, is the world's largest known crude oil resource.|$|E
25|$|The narrator {{discovers that}} the vast grey town and its ghostly {{inhabitants}} are minuscule {{to the point of}} being invisible compared with <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> Heaven and reality. This is illustrated in the encounter of the blessed woman and her husband: she is surrounded by gleaming attendants while he shrinks down to invisibility as he uses a collared tragedian— representative of his self-punishing emotional blackmail of others— to speak for him.|$|E

60|$|My longing {{was beyond}} the power of opposition; I closed my eyes, {{stretched}} out my arms toward the god of my vocation and felt myself drawn with the suddenness of thought through <b>the</b> trackless <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> space.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the pilgrim {{presence}} in Rome {{and the vast}} diplomatic contingent from nations around the world raised concerns by the College of Cardinals that the funeral, conclave and installation of a new pope would make Vatican City a target for terrorism. The anti-terrorism task forces responsible for securing the funeral considered international terrorists the primary potential threat because of the attending dignitaries; domestic terrorism from Italian political extremists was considered less likely.|$|E
25|$|Bradley's {{service to}} the country as {{assistant}} postmaster general is regarded as influential. Bradley's postal routes and schedules, enforced rigidly over a thirty-year period, gave the Post Office Department a rapid and reliable engine for delivering information across vast distances, instilling in citizens {{the importance of the}} connectedness they shared with their distant neighbors. The numerous maps Bradley published, while later discarded and redrawn by the new Jackson administration, created in their time a sense of <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> American territory.|$|E
25|$|Huntington {{had envisioned}} the work {{depicting}} {{a history of}} Spain, but the painter preferred the less specific 'Vision of Spain', eventually opting for {{a representation of the}} regions of the Iberian Peninsula, and calling it The Provinces of Spain. Despite <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the canvases, Sorolla painted all but one en plein air, and travelled to the specific locales to paint them: Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Elche, Seville, Andalusia, Extremadura, Galicia, Guipuzcoa, Castile, Leon, and Ayamonte, at each site painting models posed in local costume. Each mural celebrated the landscape and culture of its region, panoramas composed of throngs of laborers and locals. By 1917 he was, by his own admission, exhausted. He completed the final panel by July 1919.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegraph}} wires thrummed, thrummed, thrummed above them; {{the rails}} were glaring hard lines; the goldenrod smelled dusty. Across the track was a pasture of dwarf clover and sparse lawn cut by earthy cow-paths; beyond its placid narrow green, <b>the</b> rough <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> new stubble, jagged with wheat-stacks like huge pineapples.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is one to}} do?" [...] {{the captain}} {{repeated}} after a vast interval, and suddenly becoming active and savage and blasphemous, decided to burn the Santa Rosa without further delay. Everyone aboard was pleased by that idea, everyone helped with zest; they pulled in the cable, cut it, and dropped the boat and fired her with tow and kerosene, and soon the cuberta was crackling and flaring merrily amidst <b>the</b> <b>immensities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropical night. Holroyd watched the mounting yellow flare against the blackness, and the livid flashes of sheet lightning that came and went above the forest summits, throwing them into momentary silhouette, and his stoker stood behind him watching also.|$|R
5000|$|James Corner {{considers}} landscape spatiality {{to be one}} of {{the three}} things that distinguish the medium of landscape (the others are landscape temporality and landscape materiality). He refers to Gaston Bachelard [...] in emphasizing the role of scale and psychic location, which distinguish the space of landscape from that of architecture and painting: “the immediate <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world from <b>the</b> inner <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination, the inner space of the self”.|$|R
25|$|Mrs. Norval compromises her beliefs {{when she}} realizes <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> Lola's wealth. When {{she hears the}} news of her husband's death in Egypt, she enters a clandestine {{marriage}} with Mr. Hackwell, yielding to his advances even though she {{claims to be a}} chaste woman. The couple spends Lola's wealth extravagantly as Mr. Sinclair, who was entrusted with the bulk of Lola's wealth, sends them a monthly allowance intended for Lola. Mrs. Norval uses it to advance her family's social standing in the hopes of finding wealthier, more suitable matches for her daughters. She therefore embodies the idea of Manifest Destiny. She spends Lola's money as if it were hers, since she believes she belongs to the superior race. Lola's wealth corrupts her until she succumbs to brain fever.|$|E
500|$|In 1843 Balzac placed Le Père Goriot in {{the section}} of La Comédie humaine {{entitled}} [...] "Scènes de la vie parisienne" [...] ("Scenes of life in Paris"). Quickly thereafter, he reclassified it– due to its intense focus on the private lives of its characters– {{as one of the}} [...] "Scènes de la vie privée" [...] ("Scenes of private life"). These categories and the novels in them were his attempt to create a body of work [...] "depicting all society, sketching it in <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> its turmoil". Although he had prepared only a small predecessor for La Comédie humaine, entitled Études de Mœurs, at this time, Balzac carefully considered each work's place in the project and frequently rearranged its structure.|$|E
500|$|His {{attention}} slowly shifted {{away from}} The Midwife when he wrote for, and won, the [...] "Seatonian Prize" [...] for his On <b>the</b> <b>Immensity</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme Being and when he began working with Newbery's children's magazine, The Lilliputian Magazine. However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established The Old Woman's Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats in December 1751. The Oratory included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and [...] "miscellany" [...] acts. The Oratory was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752. However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as [...] "the lowest buffoonery in the world even to me who am used to my uncle Horace." [...] Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as Poems on Several Occasions, {{which resulted in the}} end of the Oratory and The Midwife.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the play}} is {{concerned}} with demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> the difficulties that face Jason in trying to rescue Number 18. For example, he finds it difficult {{to be away from}} his wife, and struggles with the decision of whether to continue his work or return to Canada. To depict this tension, Jason and Ali communicate via Skype, represented on stage by two laptop computers placed back-to-back with Jason and Ali standing on either side facing one another. The two argue, but their interactions demonstrate the kind of love that Number 18 can only dream of. In the 2012 cross-Canada tour, a torn picture of Number 18's family remained on stage as scenery to emphasize what the character has lost. This picture took the form of a painted curtain held over a geometric floor pattern and depicted the family as tired, poor, and living in a shack. Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate said the most emotionally gripping scene was the one in which the voices cause Number 18 to recall the face of her dead father. [...] Anna Borowiecki of the St. Albert Gazette called the play a story of [...] "fallible people who find strength in each other under the worst conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> nature".|$|E
2500|$|Majesty {{above all}} {{characterized}} {{the art of}} Gleizes, bringing a startling innovation to contemporary art, as few of the modern painters had done before.

2500|$|He {{differs from}} most other art thieves {{in that he}} did not steal for any profit motive. He was a {{self-described}} art connoisseur who stole in order to build a vast personal collection, particularly of 16th and 17th century masters. At his trial, the magistrate quoted him as saying, [...] "I enjoy art. I love such works of art. I collected them and kept them at home." [...] Despite <b>the</b> <b>immensity</b> <b>of</b> his collection, he was still able to recall every piece he stole. He interrupted the lengthy reading of his collection during his trial several times to correct various details.|$|E
