5|$|Launched in 1987 {{priced at}} £350, Artemiz is the {{flagship}} <b>tonearm</b> whose design {{was also a}} break from established conventions. The arm and headshell is a one-piece construction; the large-gauge aluminium tube interference-fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is the bearing. The tube is flat {{at the other end}} to provide for mounting the cartridge. The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint. Unusually, there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever-operated lift/lower assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Xerxes {{exists in}} four {{distinct}} versions. The original two-plinth Xerxes (1985) was discontinued after about eight years' production, after the Touraj Moghaddam Signature (TMS) was launched. On the 10th {{anniversary of the}} company (1995), Roksan reprised the entry-level Xerxes turntable with a 3-plinth design named Xerxes.X. Its top plinth houses the <b>tonearm</b> and the main bearing, and is isolated from the base by five Blobs, which also allow the plinth to be adjusted in two planes – parallel and perpendicular to the motor and main bearing. The motor is driven by XPS V Reference motor drive, which receives power from DS1.5 Reference Power Supply.|$|E
25|$|Shure is {{credited}} with several industry firsts. In 1948, the company introduced the 900MG, the first phonograph cartridge capable of playing both long-playing and 78 rpm records, and in 1954, Shure's M12 Dynetic Phono Reproducer <b>tonearm</b> and cartridge set established an industry standard with a tracking force of only one gram. The M1 Studio Dynetic Cartridge introduced the principle of a moving magnet within a stationary coil, an engineering concept that dominated cartridge design for nearly 25 years due to its higher output, lower noise, and greater headroom. The Shure M3D, introduced in 1958, was the first ever stereo moving magnet cartridge, with 20dB of stereo separation at 20kHz.|$|E

50|$|In 1975, Linn {{patented}} its isobaric loading principle, {{and launched}} the Linn Isobarik loudspeaker. Initially Linn manufactured the LP12 itself, but not any other components such as <b>tonearms</b> and cartridges. This gap {{was filled with}} a largely complementary range from, amongst others, Supex cartridges, Grace and Sumiko <b>tonearms,</b> and Naim Audio amplification.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tonearm</b> skating {{forces and}} other {{perturbations}} are also {{picked up by}} the stylus. This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (restoring force) used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5Hz (the frequency at which a rpm record turns on the turntable; Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.|$|E
500|$|Early Planar 3s were {{supplied}} with the Acos manufactured R200 tone arm. The [...] comes factory-fitted with a [...] <b>tonearm</b> whose one-piece die-cast aluminium-alloy tube {{is the core}} of all Rega arms. It has higher-tolerance bearings, a decoupled counterweight, a coil-spring–type tracking force adjustment, and higher-quality interconnect cables compared to the [...] fitted to the [...] The , (launched in 2007) was fitted with a , [...] which had a new anti-skate mechanism, external <b>tonearm</b> cable, an improved vertical bearing and a new three-point attachment to the plinth instead of a single pillar.|$|E
500|$|The {{two major}} {{changes to the}} [...] during its life were firstly the {{inclusion}} of the higher quality Rega [...] <b>tonearm</b> in the 1980s, and the change to a new AC synchronous motor more recently. The motor, which had been tuned for lower vibration, allowed for the elimination of the old motor's compliant mounting.|$|E

50|$|Rega Research Ltd. is a {{high-end}} audio equipment manufacturer {{based in the}} UK. Rega was founded in 1973. The company's name was formed of the initials of its two founders (RElph & GAndy). Rega are widely known for their turntables, cartridges and <b>tonearms,</b> and has produced award winning amplification and speakers for over 20 years. In addition to manufacturing products under their own brand name, they have also served as an original equipment manufacturer of turntables and <b>tonearms</b> for other companies such as NAD and Rotel.|$|R
500|$|Considered {{by some to}} be classics, the Rega tonearms are {{regarded}} as offering high value by many reviewers, {{in the context of the}} price of the deck. Its high price–performance ratio made the [...] popular for use with other manufacturers' decks, including, for example, the Linn Sondek. It earned its place as the most widely used OEM <b>tonearm</b> on the market.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Xerxes {{design is}} deliberately {{a radical departure}} from the traditional suspended sub-chassis design. Instead of having a three-point sprung suspension separating the plinth from the sub-chassis, the Xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber [...] "Blobs". The top plinth sees mountings for the main bearing and <b>tonearm.</b> A hole is cut out from the top board for the motor assembly to emerge from its fixture on the board below. On the lower board, to which an outer surround is attached, three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to the turntable's chosen placement. One notable characteristic of the deck is the large C-shaped groove cut into the top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to the <b>tonearm</b> area. However, the cut-out is prone to a commonly observed [...] "plinth sag", where the part of it would bend out of true {{with the rest of the}} board.|$|E
500|$|In {{superseding}} the Rega [...] {{with the}} , Rega made {{improvements to the}} bearing, arm, and plinth. Rega co-founder and chief designer Roy Gandy realised the plinth could be made lighter if thicker bracing was installed at key points to make the structure stronger and stiffer. It was found that after a 2mm-thick brace was incorporated {{on the top and}} bottom of the plinth, the phenolic skin could be dispensed with. The [...] <b>tonearm</b> fitted to its predecessor was changed to the , which has a now tapered cast alloy tube that offered greater rigidity and better control of resonance.|$|E
50|$|SME is a {{brand name}} of an English company that {{produces}} high end <b>tonearms</b> and turntables, whose name has become synonymous with the industry standard detachable headshell mount.|$|R
50|$|Linn capitalised on {{the success}} of the Sondek LP12 by {{introducing}} the more affordable Basik and Axis turntables, complementary <b>tonearms</b> for the Sondek and cartridges at different price points.|$|R
50|$|Back-cueing {{was a key}} {{function}} in delivering this seamless stream of music. Radio personnel demanded robust equipment and manufacturers developed special <b>tonearms,</b> styli, cartridges and lightweight turntables to meet these demands.|$|R
500|$|The [...] was {{supplied}} with a [...] <b>tonearm</b> as against a [...] on the , {{and is available}} only in black finish. Earlier models had a glass platter, wood surround-frame plinth and S-shaped arm; Rega changed to using a fibreboard platter on the P2 which it describes as being [...] "CNC machined HDF which is then , giving a platter with good mass and accuracy." [...] Compared to the , the Rega [...] has a thicker, heavier plinth; the drive motor is mounted on the plinth using a rubber suspension for improved isolation. The glass platter is also thicker, as is the felt mat.|$|E
500|$|Early {{versions}} were {{a platform}} for mounting third party tonearms. Prior to the launch of Roksan's maiden <b>tonearm</b> – the Artemiz, it was most commonly partnered with the Rega RB300 (at the [...] "budget" [...] end), and the SME V (at the [...] "top" [...] end). Other 12-inch arms, like AudioQuest or SME 309, were also chosen by buyers. The Rega was able to function {{in a way that}} seemed more synergistic with the Xerxes than the LP12. In both price and performance terms, the original Xerxes, fitted with the Rega RB300 costing £95, became a head-on (and cheaper) alternative to the LP12 fitted with the Linn Ittok arm.|$|E
500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are useful}} in general where the system {{includes}} transducers between different energy domains. [...] Another area of application is the mechanical parts of acoustic systems such as the pickup and <b>tonearm</b> of record players. [...] This was of some importance in early phonographs where the audio is transmitted from the pickup needle to the horn through various mechanical components entirely without electrical amplification. [...] Early phonographs suffered badly from unwanted resonances in the mechanical parts. [...] It was found that these could be eliminated by treating the mechanical parts as components of a low-pass filter which {{has the effect of}} flattening out the passband.|$|E
50|$|Most of them use a {{standard}} H-4 Bayonet Mount, which will fit all S shape <b>tonearms.</b> The bayonet has {{a standard}} barrel whose dimensions are 8 mm diameter and 12 mm length, with its four pins {{connected to the}} four colour-coded head-shell lead wires.|$|R
50|$|Oswalds Mill Audio (OMA) is an American {{lifestyle}} {{company that}} designs and manufactures high end audio {{equipment for the}} home. OMA was founded in 2007, in New Tripoli, Pennsylvania by the filmmaker Jonathan Weiss. In addition to horn loudspeakers, OMA also manufactures amplifiers, turntables, <b>tonearms,</b> and accessories.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} were {{a platform}} for mounting third party <b>tonearms,</b> had a basic power supply arrangements, and would only revolve at 33⅓ rpm. Those users requiring a 45 rpm option would have to purchase a special adaptor to increase {{the diameter of the}} motor pulley and platter speed accordingly.|$|R
500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor. The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density fibreboard (MDF) top board on which the bearing and <b>tonearm</b> assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the bottom board (along with the motor assembly) support yet decouple from the top board. Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E
500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, <b>tonearm</b> show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 <b>tonearm</b> {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover artwork {{features}} {{a photo of}} Donald Fagen as a disc jockey, wearing a collared shirt and tie, speaking into a RCA 77DX microphone. In front of him is a turntable (16inch '50s model, with a [...] <b>tonearm),</b> an ashtray, and a pack of Chesterfield King cigarettes. Visible {{on the table with}} the record player, is the cover of the 1958 jazz album Sonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders (one of Fagen's favorite albums). On the wall behind is a large clock, indicating that the time is 4:09. An advertisement in Billboard shortly before the album's release described the album cover: [...] "At 4:09 a.m., silence and darkness have taken hold of the city. The only sound is the voice of The Nightfly". Fagen appeared on the album cover despite his reclusive nature. [...] "It was an autobiographical album so it seemed like I might as well go public with it," [...] he said. The cover was shot in Fagen's apartment in the Upper East Side of Manhattan by photographer James Hamilton. Two shoots were arranged because in the first, the RCA microphone was facing the wrong direction. Gale Sasson and Vern Yenor are credited with the cover's set design.|$|E
50|$|Because {{measured}} {{audio distortion}} {{is higher in}} electromechanical components such as microphones, turntables, <b>tonearms,</b> phono cartridges, and loudspeakers than in purely electronic components such as preamplifiers and power amplifiers, objectivists generally do not accept that very subtle differences in the latter can have an appreciable effect on the perceived quality of reproduced sound.|$|R
5000|$|London Decca is a {{manufacturer}} of phonograph <b>tonearms</b> and pick-up cartridges. The London Decca cartridges may be unique in {{that they do not}} employ a [...] "proper" [...] cantilever, neither are they [...] "moving magnet" [...] (MM) nor [...] "moving coil" [...] (MC) designs. These products are critically acclaimed for their sonic detail.|$|R
5000|$|Some extreme {{examples}} required smaller grooving {{than standard}} 7-inch {{such as the}} single [...] "Montana" [...] by John Linnell (of the band They Might Be Giants) {{which was in the}} shape of the United States. This record was problematic because record players whose <b>tonearms</b> returned automatically after the record finished playing often did just that before the needle actually reached the song.|$|R
500|$|Tufan Hashemi said Roksan {{sought to}} create {{equipment}} that would excel in high-quality musical reproduction {{and capable of}} involving the listener on an emotional level. Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound. Moghaddam, acting as chief designer, {{set out to find}} solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt-driven suspended sub-chassis turntable design of Edgar Villchur, where the sub-chassis and <b>tonearm</b> are free to rotate. Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes. One such torsional mode is said to be caused by [...] "groove drag" [...] – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it. Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable-drive motor casing on its own bearing. The motor, mounted separately and tethered to a spring, is allowed limited rotation about its own axis; because the load varied with groove modulations, the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring-loaded motor, and the platter acceleration mitigated. In the words of Tufan Hashemi, Roksan Audio's managing director: [...] "We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read, as the record itself would be floating. We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation {{from the rest of the}} deck, and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another problem arises {{because of}} the {{geometry}} of the <b>tonearm.</b> Master recordings are cut on a recording lathe where a sapphire stylus [...] moves radially across the blank, suspended on a straight track and driven by a lead screw. Most turntables use a pivoting <b>tonearm,</b> introducing side forces and pitch and azimuth errors, and thus distortion in the playback signal. Various mechanisms were devised in attempts to compensate, {{with varying degrees of}} success. See more at phonograph.|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl records can be warped by heat, {{improper}} storage, {{exposure to}} sunlight, or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap {{on the album}} cover. A small degree of warp was common, and allowing for {{it was part of}} the art of turntable and <b>tonearm</b> design. [...] "Wow" [...] (once-per-revolution pitch variation) could result from warp, or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered. Standard practice for LPs was to place the LP in a paper or plastic inner cover. This, if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover, was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface. Singles, with rare exceptions, had simple paper covers with no inner cover.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{designed}} in the 1960s it {{is still one of}} the masterpieces in audio technology and can easily compete with contemporary constructions. Due to its construction, Denon DL-103 is recommended as one of the very few cartridges suitable for heavy <b>tonearms.</b> (like in Lenco or Garrard turntables)As a low-output phono cartridge it requires either a step up transformer for a standard MM phono preamp, or phono preamp with built-in MC input.|$|R
50|$|Audiophiles {{play music}} {{from a wide}} variety of sources {{including}} phonograph records, compact discs (CDs), and digital audio file formats that are uncompressed as well as ones that are compressed using lossless data compression such as FLAC, Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless and Apple Lossless (ALAC). Since the early 1990s, CDs have become the most common source of high-quality music. Nevertheless, turntables, <b>tonearms,</b> and magnetic cartridges are still used, despite the difficulties of keeping records free from dust and the delicate set-up associated with turntables.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Technics {{introduced}} two belt-driven turntables for {{the mass}} market, the SL-20 and SL-23. The principal {{difference between the two}} models was the addition, in the SL-23, of semi-automatic operation and an adjustable speed control with built-in strobe light. They offered technical specifications and features rivalling much more expensive turntables, including well-engineered s-shaped <b>tonearms</b> with tracking weight and anti-skate adjustments. At the time they were introduced the SL-20 and SL-23, which sold for $100.00 and $140.00, respectively, set a new performance standard for inexpensive turntables.|$|R
