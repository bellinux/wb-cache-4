5|$|The swift {{outcome of}} the trial {{resulted}} in the almost immediate execution of the two men. One Driscoll, led out alone, was shot first. <b>Then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> was led out, shown his dead relative's body and pushed for a confession. The defendant refused to confess, though he reportedly said he had committed other crimes for which he deserved death, and was also shot.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to muzzle Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} between Lehto and Lamy {{caused the}} safety car to be deployed, {{with all the}} remaining competitors holding position behind it while travelling at a reduced speed. During this period, {{as a result of}} travelling at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with Gerhard Berger, had expressed concern that the safety car (itself only reintroduced in Formula One in 1993 and only the third time used since <b>then,</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> occurrences being the 1993 Brazilian Grand Prix and the 1993 British Grand Prix) did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Senna was also worried by a procedure introduced at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix, whereby the safety car would lead the grid on the formation lap, rather than letting the race leader choose the pace of the formation lap. The procedure was removed for this race.|$|E
25|$|P. californicus {{is active}} from mid-morning until dusk, {{and can be}} seen in bushes running along {{branches}} or poised near their tips.

Between 1832 and 1918 Caithness elected an MP to every parliament.|$|E
25|$|Common law courts usually use an {{adversarial}} system, {{in which}} two sides present their cases to a neutral judge.

25|$|If a bail {{falls off}} the stumps {{for any other}} reason while the ball is still in play, and a later {{incident}} such as a run out attempt requires the wicket to be broken, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> bail can be removed (if {{it has not yet}} fallen off), or a stump can be struck out of the cricket ground or pulled up, as described above.|$|E
25|$|In 1799 William Murdoch, {{who worked}} for the firm of Boulton and Watt, invented a new type of steam valve, called the D slide valve.

2500|$|Amid the carnage, Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, Major Ben Hearman and Lieutenant Colonel Cooper all protested to Dougherty {{that his}} tactics were at fault. They all were punished with {{transfers}} to backwaters. Cooper (shot in the hip at Gona) has recalled; [...] "...they {{used to say}} there were two types of officers: those who were always going to reach <b>the</b> top, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> that are always at fault. But <b>then</b> there is <b>the</b> <b>other</b> type like Arnold Potts, who just {{get on with the}} job and do it superbly.

30|$|It {{is easy to}} {{see that}} if one of C^+,+, C^-,+, C^-,+, and C^-,- is {{unbounded}} <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are also unbounded. Therefore, it suffices to show that C^+,+ is unbounded. Suppose that C^+,+ is bounded. Then C is also bounded. In view of the global bifurcation theorem (Theorem  2.1), C satisfies conclusion (2) of Theorem  2.1, that is, C contains (λ̃, 0, 0), where λ̃≠λ_ 1 and λ̃^- 1 ∈σ(S).|$|R
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} Abimelech first sent Phicol, {{the captain of}} his host, but {{he was unable to}} pacify Isaac. Then Abimelech sent his friend Ahuzzath, but Isaac still {{remained}} unpacified. When Abimelech then went himself, Isaac allowed himself to be appeased. Hence, the Sages taught that one need not ask another's forgiveness more than three times. If the other does not forgive the third time, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> becomes the wrongdoer.|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} metrics appear {{for example in}} routing a machine that drills a given set of holes in a printed circuit board. The Manhattan metric {{corresponds}} to a machine that adjusts first one co-ordinate, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> so the time {{to move to a}} new point is the sum of both movements. The maximum metric corresponds to a machine that adjusts both co-ordinates simultaneously, so the time to move to a new point is the slower of the two movements.|$|E
25|$|In legend, griffins {{not only}} mated for life, but if either partner died, <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> would {{continue}} {{the rest of}} its life alone, never to search for a new mate. The griffin was thus made an emblem of the Church's opposition to remarriage. Being a union of an aerial bird and a terrestrial beast, it was seen in Christendom to be a symbol of Jesus, who was both human and divine. As such it can be found sculpted on some churches.|$|E

25|$|Hermaphroditism {{occurs when}} a given {{individual}} in a species possesses {{both male and female}} reproductive organs, or can alternate between possessing first one, and <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with gonochorism, where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of teleost fishes.|$|E
25|$|The {{greater rhea}} is a silent bird except during mating season, {{when they make}} low booming noises, and as chicks, when they give a mournful whistle. During the non-breeding season they will form flocks of between 10 and 100 birds. When in flocks, {{they tend to be}} less vigilant, but the males can get {{aggressive}} towards other males. When chased they will flee in a zigzag pattern, alternately raising one wing <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> These flocks break up in the winter in time for breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Female P. californicus and P. apacheanus are {{unusual in}} that they perform an {{acceptance}} dance just before the male touches them. With forelegs high and wide apart and abdomen bent to the side, the female sways before the male, sometimes with a few steps {{to one side and}} <b>then</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> In other Phidippus species, the female rejects the male by extending the first pair of legs whenever he approaches too closely, and merely fails to ward him off when she is ready to accept him.|$|E
