Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations {{of the body and}} tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and {{attempts were made to}} poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E

25|$|In 1776, the Continental Congress {{authorized}} {{plans to}} produce a silver coin <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rapidly failing Continental—the first attempt by the fledgling U.S. at paper currency. Several examples were struck in brass, pewter, and silver, but a circulating coin was not produced, {{due in large part}} to the financial difficulties of running the Revolutionary War. The Continental Dollar bears a date of 1776, and while its true denomination is not known, it is generally the size of later dollars, and the name has stuck. The failure of the Continental exacerbated a distrust of paper money among both politicians and the populace at large. The letters of Thomas Jefferson indicate that he wished the United States to eschew paper money and instead mint coins of similar perceived value and worth to those foreign coins circulating at the time.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} eighties, An Bord Pleanála finally granted {{permission}} for its wings to be demolished. In 1981, it {{was stripped of}} its wings. These constituted {{seventy percent of the}} house. The essential conditions that called for the restoration {{of the rest of the}} house were subsequently ignored. When the wings were demolished, nothing was done <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the house. Despite this, the building was still structurally safe. The Corporation had argued that the proposed development was unsuitable for the area. Once Roches had completed their Department Store, the conservationists had no legal leg to stand on, since permission to demolish the house was effective once permission to develop the site had been granted. They became unwilling to negotiate with the conservationists. Roches declared that Frescati was beyond restoration. Marie Avis Walker pointed out that the British Embassy in Merrion Square, which had been gutted by fire, had been restored.|$|E

On 28 April, an AC-119G from the 17 SOS, Shadow 78, crashed on takeoff from Tan Son Nhut after an engine failure, killing six of the eight crewmembers. From 5 May 1970, the squadron began flying in the Cambodian Campaign after United States forces moved into Cambodia <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Cambodian Army and capture North Vietnamese base camps, and its air support was credited with lifting the siege of Kampong Thom. The 17th's crews flew 32 missions in three days at Kampong Thom and expanded over 500,000 7.62mm rounds during the campaign. Although the ground campaign ended on 30 June, the gunships continued to provide air support to the Cambodian Army and on 1 August the gunships began daytime air interdiction {{due to the lack}} of effective enemy antiaircraft fire in the country.|$|E
25|$|Australia again {{started with}} a wobble, losing McCosker for 4 in the third over, but a 42 run {{partnership}} between Chappell and Ian Davis got them back on track. Davis eventually went for 18, but that brought Kim Hughes to the crease. Although scoring less prolifically, Hughes capably supported Chappell as he moved towards a well-deserved century, falling on 102. It was enough <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Australian second innings, and solid contributions from Hughes (27), Doug Walters (24), Richie Robinson (26), and Max Walker (22) took Australia to 251 all out. Gloucestershire required an unlikely 343 for victory, and never looked like they would reach the target. Andy Stovold made 27, and Jim Foat and David Shepherd both chipped in with 26 each, but Gloucentershire were all out for 169. Len Pascoe (4/36) and Ray Bright (4/63) were the pick of the Australian bowlers, as they wrapped up a deserved victory by 173 runs in two days.|$|E

Subsequent to this, further pressure came on the other two large Irish banks, who on 2009-01-19, had share values fall by between 47 and 50% in one day.

Koht teamed up with the conservative politician C. J. Hambro, who had edited Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift to which Koht had contributed.

500|$|The Suez Canal, {{opened in}} 1869, cut weeks and {{thousands}} of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. [...] Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, {{though some of the}} stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the Ottoman Empire; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the Eastern Question of {{what to do about the}} decaying empire governed from Constantinople. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best <b>to</b> <b>prop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.|$|E

40|$|The US {{economy is}} {{in the throes of}} the worst {{financial}} and economic crisis since the Great Depression. What commenced as a crisis in the US housing and mortgage markets has contaminated other sectors and spread globally. Hitherto, most policy efforts and resources have been devoted <b>to</b> <b>propping</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> banking and financial sector. It is clear that in order to restore economic growth and confidence internationally, policies must be designed and implemented to stabilize the housing market. With this objective in mind, our paper analyzes and evaluates a wide and comprehensive spectrum of policy proposals that have been put forward to deal with the critical issue of housing foreclosures and the need to stabilize the housing and housing finance sector. We also describe the genesis and evolution of the crisis, as well as present our own cross-state analysis of the determinants of subprime mortgages and foreclosures. We examine initial responses of various Government agencies and public-private partnerships, the recent Obama administration programs and proposals, as well as wide-ranging and diverse proposals from prominent academics, policy think-tanks and housing experts. Proposed plans include solutions involving auxiliary loans, shared appreciation mortgages, standards for renegotiated principal, across-the-board rate adjustments, creation of new Government institutions and legal reform. We analyze the potential effectiveness of these proposals applying our benchmark criteria of i) non-recurrence and future mitigation of moral hazard, ii) bang for the buck, iii) fairness and distributive aspects, iv) judicious mix of short-term and long term solutions, and v) regulatory implications. In conclusion, we propose some essential elements of a fair, effective and viable plan to fix the residential finance system and the housing market...|$|R

50|$|Fixed {{exchange}} rates are usually maintained {{by a combination}} of legally enforced capital controls and the central bank standing ready to purchase or sell domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency.
