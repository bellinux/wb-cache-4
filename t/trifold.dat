25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new {{autorack}} cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two <b>trifold</b> doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with single axle trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E

5000|$|The Military Merit Medal became {{obsolete}} {{with the}} fall of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in November 1918. However, previously awarded medals continued to be worn by veterans in many of the successor states of the empire. After the Anschluss in 1938, when Nazi Germany annexed the Austrian Republic, the Military Merit Medal and other Austro-Hungarian medals were often worn mounted German-style rather than on <b>trifolds.</b> Equally, when the 1934 German Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918 was extended to eligible Austrian and Czech military personnel after the Anschluss and the annexation of Sudetenland in 1938, it was also suspended from trifold-style ribbons in those countries.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the optimum preservation conditions for preloading DMEK lenticules using organ culture system. Methods. 8. 5 [*]mm DMEK lenticules were stripped and preserved with endothelium flap-in for 4 days at RT in an IOL cartridge that was blocked with rubber stoppers from each end. In C 1, tissues {{were collected from}} tissue culture medium (TCM) and preserved in TCM. In C 2, tissues were collected from transport medium (TCM + 6 % dextran T 500) (TM) and preserved in TM. In C 3, tissues were collected from TCM and preserved in TM. Mortality, glucose uptake, histological staining, tight junctions and cell apoptosis were studied post-preservation. Results. Mortality in C 1, C 2, and C 3 were 49. 40 %, 8. 53 %, and 27. 74 %, with 40. 7 %, 13 %, and 41. 8 % uncovered areas. Glucose uptake (mg/mL) was 0. 32, 0. 43, and 0. 56 in C 1, C 2, and C 3. PAS staining showed presence of DM and endothelium in C 2 but not in C 1 and with fewer cells in C 3. ZO- 1 was expressed in all the conditions. Polymorphism was higher in C 1 and C 3. Mild apoptosis was observed in C 3. Conclusions. Dextran may {{play an important role}} in preserving the endothelial cells before and after stripping for <b>trifolded</b> (endothelium-in) preloaded DMEK lenticules...|$|R
40|$|Stents {{are small}} tubelike structures, {{implanted}} in coronary and peripheral arteries to reopen narrowed vessel sections. This endovascular intervention remains suboptimal, as {{the success rate}} is limited by restenosis. This renarrowing of a stented vessel {{is related to the}} arterial injury caused by stent-artery and balloon-artery interactions, and a local subsequent inflammatory process. Therefore, efforts to optimize the stent deployment remain very meaningful. Several authors have studied with finite element modeling the mechanical behavior of balloon-expandable stents, but none of the proposed models incorporates the folding pattern of the balloon. the developed a numerical model in which the CYPHER (TM) stent is combined with a realistic <b>trifolded</b> balloon. In this paper, the impact of several parameters such as balloon length, folding pattern, and relative position of the stent with respect to the balloon catheter on the free stent expansion has been investigated. Quantitative validation of the modeling strategy shows excellent agreement with data provided by the manufacturer and, therefore, the model serves as a solid basis for further investigations. The parametric analyses showed that both the balloon length and the folding pattern have a considerable influence on the uniformity and symmetry of the transient stent expansion. Consequently, this approach can be used to select the most appropriate balloon length. and folding pattern for a particular stent design in order to optimize the stent deployment. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that small positioning inaccuracies may change the expansion behavior of a stent. Therefore, the placement of the stent on the balloon catheter should be accurately carried out, again in order to decrease the endothelial damage...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Descemet {{membrane}} endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) {{preparation is}} technically demanding {{and is a}} limiting factor for uptake {{of this kind of}} surgery. Supply methods that simplify the procedure for surgeons are key to increasing uptake. This study compares two different shipping protocols for DMEK. METHODS: An 8. 5 [*]mm DMEK graft was punched, marked and loaded for transportation in two different conditions: (A) endothelium <b>trifolded</b> inwards in organ culture conditions (n= 7) and (B) endothelium rolled outwards in hypothermic conditions (n= 7). Tissues were shipped from Italy to the UK, then analysed for orientation, endothelial cell density, denuded areas, cell mortality, triple viability staining (Hoechst/ethidium homodimer/calcein AM (HEC)), immunolocalisation of ZO- 1 and Na/K-ATPase proteins, visualisation of actin filaments using phalloidin and histological analysis using H&E on paraffin-embedded sections. RESULTS: All tissues clearly showed the mark used for graft orientation. After shipping in condition A, there was an increase in cell mortality of 8. 1 % and in denuded areas of 22. 4 %, whereas for condition B there was an increase in cell mortality of 14. 2 % and in denuded areas of 34. 3 % after shipping. HEC staining revealed areas of viable cells and apoptotic cells, with large denuded areas found in the periphery for condition B and within folds for condition A. CONCLUSIONS: Prestripped preloaded DMEK grafts retained sufficient viable cells for transplantation, with condition A (endothelium-in) offering the advantage of greater flexibility of use due to a longer shelf-life. HEC analysis provides further detailed information as to the status of DMEK grafts and should be used in future similar studies...|$|R

5000|$|The next {{significant}} change occurred on September 23, 1914, {{shortly after the}} outbreak of World War I. The Military Merit Cross was divided into three classes. The previous Military Merit Cross, a breast decoration worn on a <b>trifold</b> ribbon, became the 3rd Class. A neck badge was created as the 2nd Class and a pinback cross became the new 1st Class. This classification made the Military Merit Cross effectively an order, with the 3rd Class equivalent to a knight's badge, the 2nd Class equivalent to a commander's badge, and the 1st Class equivalent to the breast star of an order. A recipient of an earlier Military Merit Cross without the War Decoration, if awarded the Military Merit Cross with the War Decoration, could wear both, and a recipient of a higher class could continue to wear the lower class. The statutes allowed for all three classes to be awarded {{with or without the}} War Decoration, but given the wartime situation, most awards were with the War Decoration.|$|E
