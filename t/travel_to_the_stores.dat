The Indians offered protection to merchants who would move their stores to locations closer to their territory, and pointed out the Apalachicola River as a suitable place for a trading house. The Creeks said it was not only more convenient for themselves, but also much nearer to the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee Indians, and requested that the house of Panton, Leslie, & Co., who had been supplying them with goods, should be solicited to settle there for that purpose.|$|E

It is also known as online shop, e-shop, e-store, internet shop, webshop, webstore, online store, or virtual store. It is a form of electronic commerce where in the sale or purchase transaction is completed electronically and interactively in real -time. Recently, a large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely in electronic form. This process is called Business – to – Consumers (B 2 C). Online retailers are also known as e-tailers and online retail is sometimes known as e- tail. Almost all big retailers are now electronically present on the World Wide Web. Online shopping, such an easy way of doing shopping mechanism provides the changed face of retailing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shoppers.

5000|$|The {{blowback}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as [...] "simple", [...] "straight" [...] or [...] "pure" [...] blowback) system represents the most basic auto loading operation type. In a blowback mechanism, the bolt rests against {{the rear of the}} barrel, but is not locked in place. At the point of ignition, expanding gases push the bullet forward through the barrel {{while at the same time}} pushing the case rearward against the bolt. The expanding gases push <b>the</b> bolt assembly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, but the motion is slowed by the mass of the bolt, internal friction, and <b>the</b> force required <b>to</b> compress <b>the</b> action spring. The design must ensure that the delay is long enough that bullet exits the barrel before the cartridge case clears the chamber. The empty case is ejected as <b>the</b> bolt <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>stored</b> energy of <b>the</b> compressed action spring then drives the bolt forward (although not until the trigger is pulled if the weapon fires from an open bolt).

40|$|A {{model of}} retail {{activity}} allocation and shopping trip assignment, with endogenous zonal commodity prices {{and costs of}} travel, is developed, based on three main assumptions. First, the revenues from sales of retail goods in each zone {{are assumed to be}} in balance with the costs of supplying such goods. Second, shoppers in each zone of residence are distributed to shopping zones according to a logit function of a generalized cost of shopping and traveling. Third, shoppers choose a <b>travel</b> route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> such that their cost of travel is minimized. The model solution thus represents an economic, market-clearing equilibrium and a transportation network equilibrium.

Methods Data included locational points for 315 food stores and 204 fast food restaurants, and neighborhood characteristics from the 2000 U. S. Census for the 197 census block group (CBG) study area. Neighborhood deprivation and vehicle availability were calculated for each CBG. Minimum distance was determined by calculating network distance from the population-weighted center of each CBG <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest supercenter, supermarket, grocery, convenience store, dollar store, mass merchandiser, and fast food restaurant. Coverage was determined by calculating the number of each type of food store and fast food restaurant within a network distance of 1, 3, and 5 miles of each population-weighted CBG center. Neighborhood need and access were examined using Spearman ranked correlations, spatial autocorrelation, and multivariate regression models that adjusted for population density. Results Overall, neighborhoods had best access to convenience stores, fast food restaurants, and dollar stores. After adjusting for population density, residents in neighborhoods with increased deprivation had <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> a significantly greater distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearest supercenter or supermarket, grocery store, mass merchandiser, dollar store, and pharmacy for food items. The results were quite different for association of need with <b>the</b> number of <b>stores</b> within 1 mile. Deprivation was only associated with fast food restaurants; greater deprivation was associated with fewer fast food restaurants within 1 mile. CBG with greater lack of vehicle availability had slightly better access to more supercenters or supermarkets, grocery stores, or fast food restaurants. Increasing deprivation was associated with decreasing numbers of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, dollar stores, and fast food restaurants within 3 miles.

40|$|In the {{two decades}} since the United States Congress passed the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, {{there has been a}} surge of {{interest}} in making urban transportation systems more sustainable. Many agencies, representing all levels of government, have searched for strategies to reduce private automobile use, including policies to shift local driving to pedestrian and bicycle modes. Progress has been made in a number of communities, but the automobile remains the dominant mode of transportation in all metropolitan regions. Sustainable transportation advocates are especially interested in routine travel, such as shopping and other errands, because it tends to be done frequently and for distances that could be covered realistically by walking or bicycling. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2009 National Household Travel Survey, Americans made more trips for shopping than for any other purpose, including commuting to and from work. One-third of these shopping trips were shorter than two miles (3. 2 km). However, 76 % of these short shopping trips were made by automobile, while only 21 % were made by walking and 1 % by bicycling. In order to identify effective strategies <b>to</b> change <b>travel</b> behavior, practitioners need a greater understanding of why people choose certain modes for routine <b>travel.</b> Choosing <b>to</b> walk or bicycle rather than travel by automobile may help individuals get exercise, save money, interact with neighbors, and reduce tailpipe emissions. Yet, in some communities, non-motorized modes may also require more time and physical effort to run a series of errands, be less convenient for carrying packages and traveling in bad weather, and be perceived as having a higher risk of traffic crashes or street crime than driving. A mixed-methods approach was used to develop a more complete understanding of factors that are associated with walking or bicycling rather than driving for routine travel. An intercept survey was implemented <b>to</b> gather <b>travel</b> data from 1, 003 customers at retail pharmacy stores in 20 San Francisco Bay Area neighborhoods in fall 2009. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 26 survey participants in spring and summer 2010 to gain a deeper understanding of factors that influenced their transportation decisions. The methodological approach makes several contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body of research on sustainable transportation. For example, the study: Explored multiple categories of factors that may be associated with walking and bicycling, including travel, socioeconomic, attitude, perception, and shopping district characteristics. Few studies of pedestrian or bicycle mode choices have included all of these categories of factors. Statistical models showed that variables in all categories had significant associations with mode choice. Documented and analyzed short pedestrian movements, such as from a parking space to a store entrance or from a bus stop to home. These detailed data provided a greater understanding of pedestrian activity than traditional travel survey analyses. Walking was used as the primary mode for 65 % of respondent trips between stops within shopping districts, and 52 % of all respondents walked along a street or between stops at some time between leaving and returning home. Maps of respondent pedestrian path density revealed distinct pedestrian activity patterns in different types of shopping districts. Used four different approaches <b>to</b> capture participant <b>travel</b> mode information. Respondents reported the primary mode of transportation they were using {{on the day of the}} survey, the mode they typically used, and all modes that they would consider using <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> survey <b>store.</b> They also mapped all stops on their tour and said what modes they used between each stop. These four approaches revealed nuanced travel habits and made it possible to correct inaccuracies in self-reported primary travel mode data. Measured and tested fine-grained local environment variables in shopping districts rather than around respondents' homes. These variables characterized the shopping district area (e. g., sidewalks, bicycle facilities, metered parking, and tree canopy coverage), the main commercial roadway (e. g., posted speed limit, number of automobile lanes, and pedestrian crossing distance), and <b>the</b> survey <b>store</b> site (e. g., number of automobile and bicycle parking spaces and distance from <b>the</b> public sidewalk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> entrance). This dissertation adds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> small number of studies that have explored how the characteristics of activity destinations are related <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> behavior. <b>The</b> study results contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body of knowledge about factors that may encourage people <b>to</b> shift routine <b>travel</b> from automobile <b>to</b> pedestrian or bicycle modes. After controlling for travel factors such as time and cost, socioeconomic characteristics, and individual attitudes, mixed logit models showed that automobile use was negatively associated with higher employment density, smaller parking lots, and metered on-street parking in the shopping district. Walking was positively associated with higher population density, more street tree canopy coverage, lower speed limits, and fewer commercial driveway crossings. The exploratory analysis of a small number of bicycle tours found that bicycling was associated with more extensive bicycle facility networks and more bicycle parking. However, people were more likely to drive when they perceived a high risk of crime. Results also suggest the magnitude of mode shifts that could occur if short- and long-term land use and transportation system changes were made to each study shopping district. The mode choice model representing <b>travel</b> only <b>to</b> and from <b>the</b> study shopping districts (N = 388) was used to estimate respondent mode shares under the following three scenarios: 1) double population and employment densities in each study shopping district, 2) double street tree canopy coverage in each study shopping district, and 3) eliminate half of the automobile parking 3 spaces at <b>the</b> survey <b>store.</b> Based on <b>the</b> model, the combination of these three changes could increase pedestrian mode share among the 388 sample respondents from 43 % to 61 % and decrease automobile mode share from 50 % to 31 %. This shift could eliminate 129 (13 %) of the 983 respondent vehicle miles traveled (208 of the 1, 580 respondent vehicle kilometers traveled), and 110 (36 %) of the 308 times respondents parked their automobiles in the shopping district. The mode choice model of walking versus driving within survey shopping districts (N = 286) was used <b>to</b> test <b>the</b> combination of the following scenarios: 1) cluster separated stores around shared parking lots, 2) consolidate commercial driveways so that there are half as many driveway crossings along the main commercial roadway, 3) reduce all main commercial roadway speed limits to 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour), and 4) install metered parking in all shopping districts. These changes could increase the percentage of the 286 sample respondents walking between shopping district activities from 32 % to 54 %. This shift could eliminate 29 (38 %) of the 76 respondent vehicle miles traveled (47 of the 122 respondent vehicle kilometers traveled), and 105 (22 %) of the 469 times respondents parked their automobiles in the shopping district. Note that these forecasted mode shifts are illustrative examples based on cross-sectional data and do not account for the process of modifying travel behavior habits. Qualitative interviews provided a foundation for a proposed Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. This five-step theory also drew from survey results and other mode choice theories in the transportation and psychology fields. The first step, 1) awareness and availability, determines which modes are viewed as possible choices for routine travel. The next three steps, 2) basic safety and security, 3) convenience and cost, and 4) enjoyment, assess situational tradeoffs between modes in the choice set and are supported by many of the statisticallysignificant factors in the mode choice models. The final step, 5) habit, reinforces previous choices and closes the decision process loop. Socioeconomic characteristics explain differences in how individuals view each step in the process. Understanding each step in the mode choice decision process can help planners, designers, engineers, and other policy-makers implement a comprehensive set of strategies that may be able to shift routine automobile <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> pedestrian and bicycle modes.
