25|$|The nearest {{fire station}} was just six blocks away. Firefighters were {{initially}} alerted {{by the force}} of the explosion buckling the fire station door. Originally it was thought that a car had struck the fire station, but when firefighters went outside, they quickly realized this was not the case. One of the drivers soon spotted smoke and a fire engine and a paramedic unit were dispatched <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> smoke. These vehicles were the first rescuers on the scene and arrived just three minutes, forty seconds after the initial explosion. They immediately sent for the department's heavy urban rescue team. Ultimately, 125 firefighters in 34 vehicles, 52 police officers, multiple private ambulances and the American Red Cross all helped at the scene, which was classed by the fire service as a five-alarm emergency.|$|E
25|$|Aegina {{had always}} {{been exposed to the}} raids of corsairs and had oppressive {{governors}} during these last 30years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a bakshish to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the voivode who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.|$|E

2500|$|Paliparan is {{situated}} at the southeastern part of Dasmariñas. In the easternmost part, is surrounded by the municipalities of Gen. Mariano Alvarez, Cavite and San Pedro, Laguna. This place was a grassy land with no trees growing on its wide space providing an excellent place for flying kites during summer. In fact, this was {{what used to be}} - a paliparan - meaning an airfield for flying kites. During the Spanish period, the Spaniards used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place during weekends to fly kites of different designs and colors. The first settlers here came from the town of Imus. Among them are the families of Faustino Alvarez, Flaviano Pakingan, Gregorio de la Cruz, Pablo Papa, Dominguez and the Martinez. In 1911, most of the residents here are said to be uneducated because there were only eight persons who can vote. Also during the Spanish period, this place became a hiding place for the Katipuneros/revolucionarios. During the Japanese occupation, some hide-outs of the guerillas were found here such as of [...] "P.Q.O.G., R.C.T.C. Hunters, Reyes Regimen and Saulog Regimen". In June 1943, the Japanese ordered the residents to assemble in front of the school wherein they were not given food and water from morning until evening. Suspected guerrilla members were killed. This barangay is sub divided into six sitios which are Nyugan (on the west), Crossing, Paliparan (on the north), Paliparan Ilaya (also on the north), Pook and Burol (on the north-east). Today, it is considered {{to be one of the}} richest barangay in Dasmariñas because of the many factories and industrial estates that are located here. Among them are the Monterey, Reynold's Corporation, Molave Industrial Estate and many others.|$|E
