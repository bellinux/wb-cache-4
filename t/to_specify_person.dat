40|$|NO-FAULT INSURANCE. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Establishes a {{compulsory}} no-fault {{insurance system}} for payment of basic reparation benefits to persons injured by motor vehicle accidents. Specifies types and maximums of allowable benefits. Non-economic detriments are excluded. Property damage is not covered. Allows future adjustment of maximums to reflect economic condition changes. Requires motor vehicle owners to obtain insurance covering basic reparation benefit payments or qualify as self-insurer. Prohibits vehicle registration unless owner insured. Creates assigned claims plan to pay benefits <b>to</b> <b>specified</b> <b>persons</b> not otherwise insured. Tort liability for motor vehicle accidents is abolished with specified exceptions. Includes numerous implementing provisions. Fiscal impact on {{state or local}} governments: annual state costs would be increased by at least $ 7 million dollars.

The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze data. A total of 500 questionnaires were distributed to event practitioners, event organisations and event students within Cape Town. A response rate of 350 was achieved. Majority of event stakeholders believe that it is imperative to abide by legislation, as the event industry cannot function without policies and legislation. Policies required for proper functioning events include liability insurance, compliance with contractors and compliance with legislation. The research was limited <b>to</b> <b>specified</b> <b>persons</b> directly involved in the event industry. Local authorities and professional conference organisers should abide by policies and legislation established by the South African Government.

5000|$|In its {{earliest}} form a writ {{was simply a}} written order made by the English monarch <b>to</b> a <b>specified</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> undertake a <b>specified</b> action; for example, in the feudal era a military summons by the king {{to one of his}} tenants-in-chief to appear dressed for battle with retinue at a certain place and time. An early usage survives in the United Kingdom and Canada in a writ of election, which is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, the Governor General) to local officials (High Sheriffs of every county in the historical UK) to hold a general election. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to Parliament (then consisting of the House of Lords alone) whose advice was considered valuable or who were particularly influential, who were thereby deemed to have been created [...] "barons by writ".|$|R

Control of the general meeting theoretically ensures control of {{the composition of the}} board of directors who are usually empowered by the articles to manage the day-to-day administration of the company. The company acts by shareholders and directors voting and passing resolutions in general meeting and board meetings respectively. Controlling sufficient votes to pass resolutions in general and board meetings is therefore the essence of corporate control.

5000|$|In humans, [...] "fast mapping" [...] is {{the ability}} to form quick and rough {{hypotheses}} about the meaning of a new word after only a single exposure. In 2004, a study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed he was able to fast map. Rico initially knew the labels of over 200 items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion, that is, by knowing that the novel item was the one that he did not already know. Rico correctly retrieved such novel items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. Rico was also able to interpret phrases such as [...] "fetch the sock" [...] by its component words (rather than considering its utterance to be a single word). Rico could also give the sock <b>to</b> a <b>specified</b> <b>person.</b> This performance is comparable to that of 3-year-old humans.|$|R

If {{there is a question}} word, that word precedes the verb: Wua es dien Voda jebuaren (Where is your father born?). As in English, when using verbs in the imperative mood, it is not necessary <b>to</b> <b>specify</b> the <b>person</b> addressed, but it can be added for emphasis: Brinj (du) mie emol dän Homa (Please, (you,) bring the hammer to me).

40|$|We {{examined}} identity indicators in free self-descriptions of African, Coloured, Indian, and White {{ethnic groups}} in South Africa. Based on trait theory, independence-interdependence, and individualism-collectivism, we predicted that the individualistic White group would have more independent and context-free identity descriptions than the other, more collectivistic groups. We did not expect differences across the four groups in terms of Ideological, Religious, Spiritual and Ethnic aspects of identity. Loglinear analyses of the coded self-descriptions largely confirmed expectations for the African and White groups, but less so for the Coloured and Indian groups. Overall, the study found {{a large number of}} cross-cultural similarities with independent, individualistic, context-free and Dispositional Descriptions prevalent in all groups. The most salient difference between the African and White groups was that the African group was more likely than the White group <b>to</b> <b>specify</b> target <b>persons</b> in relational self-descriptions.

By 1937, the Mountaineer was being selected on an annual basis by Mountain.

40|$|When {{referring}} to persons in talk-in-interaction, interlocutors recruit the particular referential expressions that best satisfy both cultural and interactional contingencies, {{as well as}} the speaker’s own personal objectives. Regular referring practices reveal cultural preferences for choosing particular classes of reference forms for engaging in particular types of activities. When speakers of the northern Australian language Murriny Patha refer to each other, they display a clear preference for associating the referent to the current conversation’s participants. This preference for Association is normally achieved through the use of triangular reference forms such as kinterms. Triangulations are reference forms that link the person being spoken about <b>to</b> another <b>specified</b> <b>person</b> (e. g. Bill’s doctor). Triangulations are frequently used to associate the referent to the current speaker (e. g. my father), to an addressed recipient (your uncle) or co-present other (this bloke’s cousin). Murriny Patha speakers regularly associate key persons to themselves when making authoritative claims about items of business and important events. They frequently draw on kinship links when attempting to bolster their epistemic position. When speakers demonstrate their relatedness to the event’s protagonists, they ground their contribution to the discussion as being informed by appropriate genealogical connections (effectively, ‘I happen to know something about that. He was after all my own uncle’) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Creating a {{friendly}} human interface for visual communication {{has become a}} popular and significant topic. One key issue is to construct a three-dimensional (3 -D) face model as a visual representation. A 3 -D face model can present the desired 3 -D facial images related <b>to</b> a <b>specified</b> <b>person</b> by using the realistic 3 -D structure and texture description. In order to automatically model the human face, we propose a coarse-to-fine method to extract the facial features from a 2 -D head-and-shoulder color image and to map these facial features onto a 3 -D template model. A skin-color-based scheme is first adopted to extract salient regions for selecting the face region, where the salient region is invariant to different situations such as scaling, rotation, and skewing. To more precisely extract the facial features, face geometry and proportions obtained by training database are used for reference. After locating desired regions such as eyes, lip, nose, and eyebrows, the corresponding facial features in the located regions are extracted based on a feature detection method, where a morphology-based scheme is used to enhance the corner features. Finally the complete facial features are mapped onto the adopted shape model and each facial feature is adjusted automatically to the proper position according to the training data. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Index Terms—Face segmentation, facial feature location, facial feature extraction, shape model. I...|$|R
