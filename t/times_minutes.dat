500|$|Chamberlain is {{regarded}} as one of the most extraordinary and dominant basketball players in the history of the NBA. The 1972 NBA Finals MVP is holder of numerous official NBA all-time records, establishing himself as a scoring champion, all-time top rebounder and accurate field goal shooter. He led the NBA in scoring seven times, field goal percentage nine <b>times,</b> <b>minutes</b> played eight times, rebounding eleven times, and assists once. He was also responsible for several rule changes, including widening the lane from 12 to 16 feet, as well as changes to rules regarding inbounding the ball and shooting free throws. Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100-point game, which is widely considered one of basketball's greatest records. Decades after his record, many NBA teams did not even average 100points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted. The closest any player has gotten to 100points was the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who scored 81 in 2006. Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain's record was [...] "unthinkable ... It's pretty exhausting to think about it." [...] Chamberlain's main weakness was his notoriously poor free throw shooting, where he has the third lowest career free throw percentage in NBA history with 51.1% (based on a minimum of 1,200 attempts). Chamberlain claimed that he intentionally missed free throws so a teammate could get the rebound and score two points instead of one, but later acknowledged that he was a [...] "psycho case" [...] in this matter. On the other hand, he committed surprisingly few fouls during his NBA career, despite his rugged play in the post. Chamberlain never fouled out of a regular season or playoff game in his 14-year NBA career. His career average was only two fouls per game, despite having averaged 45.8 minutes per game over his career. He had five seasons where he committed less than two fouls per game, with a career low of 1.5 fouls during the 1962 season, in which he also averaged 50.4 points per game. His fouls per 36 minutes (a stat used to compare players that average vastly different minutes) was a remarkable 1.6 per game. [...] "First he was a scorer. Then he was a rebounder and assist man. Then with our great Laker team in 1972, he concentrated on the defensive end", said Sharman. In his two championship seasons, Chamberlain led the league in rebounding, while his scoring decreased to 24 and 15 points per game. By 1971–72 at age 35 and running less, his game had transformed to averaging only nine shots per game, compared to the 40 in his record-setting 1961–62 season. He also has a signature 'Dipper' move, whereby he would fake a hook shot, and extends his arm to a short-range finger roll to shoot under a block attempt. For his feats, Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, ranked #2 in SLAM Magazines Top 50 NBA Players of All-Time and #13 in the ESPN list [...] "Top North American athletes of the century" [...] and voted the second best center of All-Time by ESPN behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on March 6, 2007.

40|$|AbstractIn our {{continuing}} {{efforts to develop}} mass spectrometry-based methods for transthyretin (TTR) variant detection and characterization, we have sought to use matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) bioreactive probes incorporating immobilized trypsin for screening purposes. These devices show good diagnostic potential as a clinical screening tool to detect amino acid substitutions in TTR. MALDI probes allow the on-probe generation of tryptic digests. The subsequent mass analysis of the on-probe digest yields the peptide map. The inherent advantages of this method include considerably reduced digestion <b>times</b> (<b>minutes</b> vs. hours), absence of autolysis products, minimized sample handling, and hence minimal sample loss. A further advantage is that the opportunity for loss of hydrophobic peptides is reduced because no sample transfer occurs. The method can be applied as a preliminary screen for TTR variants where TTR is isolated from patient serum through immunoprecipitation. This method should also be applicable to other proteins and suitable for automation...|$|E
40|$|The water {{adsorption}} isotherms of Ni-fluorohectorite {{have been obtained}} from the relative humidity dependence of X-ray diffraction intensities, and continuous transitions between the stable hydration states were observed.

It was also observed that the environmental history of the clay mineral samples {{is important for the}} behavior displayed by these isotherms. In addition, based on thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry measurements, it was observed that a complete Ni-fluorohectorite dehydrated state can only be reached at long times (several hours) at 70 °C, or at shorter <b>times</b> (<b>minutes)</b> above 150 °C. Our observations are consistent with the existence of various forms of Ni 2 +–H 2 O complexes in Ni-fluorohectorite, and we suggest that the present results can be extended to other smectites with transition metals as interlayer charge compensating cations, and consequently have significant practical consequences in materials science and other areas...|$|E

However, all published reports are limited in time scale to address this fundamental issue. Using a FRET-based cytosolic Src reporter in a living cell, we quantified changes of Src activities as a local stress via activated integrins was applied. The stress induced rapid (< 0. 3 s) activation of Src at remote cytoplasmic sites, which depends on the cytoskeletal prestress. In contrast, there was no Src activation within 12 s of soluble epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. A 1. 8 -Pa stress over a focal adhesion activated Src {{to the same extent}} as 0. 4 ng/ml EGF at long <b>times</b> (<b>minutes),</b> and the energy levels for mechanical stimulation and chemical stimulation were comparable. The effect of both stress and EGF was less than additive. Nanometer-scale cytoskeletal deformation analyses revealed that the strong activation sites of Src by stress colocalized with large deformation sites of microtubules, suggesting that microtubules are essential structures for transmitting stresses to activate cytoplasmic proteins. These results demonstrate that rapid signal transduction via the prestressed cytoskeleton is a unique feature of mechanotransduction...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{feedback}} from accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) {{are believed to}} {{play a key role}} in LambdaCDM cosmology and galaxy formation. However, AGNs' extreme luminosities and the small angular size of their accretion flows create a challenging imaging problem. We show James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (JWST-NIRISS) Aperture Masking Interferometry (AMI) mode will enable true imaging (i. e. without any requirement of prior assumptions on source geometry) at 65 mas angular resolution at the centers of AGNs. This is advantageous for studying complex extended accretion flows around SMBHs, and in other areas of angular-resolution-limited astrophysics.

40|$|The {{bioactivity}} of hydroxyapatite (HA) and {{the strength}} and stiffness of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) suggest that composites of these two materials may be mechanically-superior as a bone replacement material. This work is the first direct comparison of spark plasma sintering (SPS) and pressureless sintering (PLS) to prepare dense composites of HA and CNTs. Previous studies of HA-CNT composites have typically used {{one or the other}} of these techniques, but since the exact powder properties, including phase purity, particle size distribution, and CNT morphology, can affect sinterability, it is difficult to compare the results of different authors. It is thus necessary to use the same powder to make a direct comparison of the two sintering techniques. The sintering conditions for HA-CNT composites are crucial. The high temperatures necessary for sintering can oxidize CNTs, while the presence of water vapour or high pressure is necessary to retain HA’s phase purity and hydroxylation. SPS offers the advantages of fast processing <b>times</b> (<b>minutes)</b> and lower sintering temperatures, but requires expensive equipment and limited geometry. PLS, on the other hand, involves cheap, readily-available equipment, but requires much longer processing times (hours) and higher sintering temperatures. The atmosphere must also be controlled carefully to balance CNT retention and preservation of HA phase purity and hydroxylation. HA-CNT powders (CNT loadings between 0 - 5 wt. ...|$|E

This study aimed to determine the optimal run-in period for a new physiotherapy-led telephone assessment and treatment service known as PhysioDirect and whether a run-in was needed prior to evaluating outcomes in an RCT. Methods The PhysioDirect trial assessed whether PhysioDirect was as effective as usual care. Prior to the main trial, a run-in of up to 12 weeks was permitted to facilitate physiotherapists to become confident in delivering the new service.

40|$|Single-molecule Förster {{resonance}} energy transfer (smFRET) {{is a powerful}} tool for extracting distance information between two fluorophores (a donor and acceptor dye) on a nanometer scale. This method is commonly used to monitor binding interactions or intra- and intermolecular conformations in biomolecules freely diffusing through a focal volume or immobilized on a surface. The diffusing geometry has the advantage to not interfere with the molecules and to allow sampling {{of a large number of}} distinct individual molecules. However, to allow separating photon bursts from individual molecules requires low concentrations. This leads to long acquisition <b>times</b> (<b>minutes</b> to hours) in order to obtain sufficient statistics. It also prevents from studying dynamic phenomena happening on time scales larger than the burst duration but smaller than the acquisition time. Parallelization of acquisition overcomes this limit by increasing the acquisition rate while keeping the same low concentrations required for individual molecule burst identification. In this work we present a realization of this idea using multispot excitation and detection. The donor excitation spots are created by a LCOS spatial light modulator while fluorescent emission of donor and acceptor dyes is collected and refocused on a custom 8 -pixel SPAD array. smFRET measurements were performed on various DNA samples synthesized with various distances between the donor and acceptor fluorophores and compared with results obtained with a conventional single-spot acquisition approach. Identical results obtained with shorter acquisition time demonstrate the potential of this approach for high-throughput smFRET analysis on freely diffusing molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the anxiolytic effect of cannabidiol (CBD) in humans follows the same pattern of an inverted U-shaped dose-effect curve observed in many animal studies. Sixty healthy subjects of both sexes aged between 18 and 35 years were randomly assigned to five groups that received placebo, clonazepam (1 mg), and CBD (100, 300, and 900 mg). The subjects were underwent a test of public speaking in a real situation (TPSRS) where each subject had to speak in front of a group formed by the remaining participants. Each subject completed the anxiety and sedation factors of the Visual Analog Mood Scale and had their blood pressure and heart rate recorded. These measures were obtained in five experimental sessions with 12 volunteers each. Each session had four steps at the following <b>times</b> (<b>minutes)</b> after administration of the drug/placebo, as time 0 : - 5 (baseline), 80 (pre-test), 153 (speech), and 216 (post-speech). Repeated-measures analyses of variance showed that the TPSRS increased the subjective measures of anxiety, heart rate, and blood pressure. Student-Newman-Keuls test comparisons among the groups in each phase showed significant attenuation in anxiety scores relative to the placebo group in the group treated with clonazepam during the speech phase, and in the clonazepam and CBD 300 mg groups in the post-speech phase. Clonazepam was more sedative than CBD 300 and 900 mg and induced a smaller increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than CBD 300 mg. The results confirmed that the acute administration of CBD induced anxiolytic effects with a dose-dependent inverted U-shaped curve in healthy subjects, since the subjective anxiety measures were reduced with CBD 300 mg, but not with CBD 100 and 900 mg, in the post-speech phase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In Japan, the {{emergency}} medical system is categorized into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary, {{depending on the}} severity of the condition of the patient. Tertiary care centres accept patients who require 24 -h monitoring. In this research, the average travel <b>times</b> (<b>minutes)</b> from the centroids of all municipalities in Japan to the nearest tertiary care centre were estimated, using the geographic information system. The systems affecting travel time to tertiary care centres were also examined. Regression analysis was performed to determine the factors affecting the travel time to tertiary care centres, using selected variables representing road conditions and {{the emergency}} transfer system. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify specific benchmarks that would be effective in reducing the average travel time to tertiary care centres in prefectures with travel times longer than the average 57 min. Results The mean travel time was 57 min, the range was 83 min, and the standard deviation was 20. 4. As a result of multiple regression analysis, average coverage area per tertiary care centre, kilometres of highway road per square kilometre, and population were selected as variables with impact on the average travel time. Based on results from linear regression analysis, benchmarks for the emergency transfer system that would effectively reduce travel time to the mean value of 57 min were identified: 26 % pavement ratio of roads (percentage of paved road to general roads), and three tertiary care centres and 108 ambulances. Conclusion Regional gaps in the travel time to tertiary care centres were identified in Japan. The systems we should focus on to reducing travel time were identified. Further reduction of travel time to tertiary care centres can be effectively achieved by improving these specific systems. Linear regression analysis showed that a 26 % pavement ratio and three tertiary care centres are beneficial to prefectures with an average time longer than the mean score, to achieve a reduction of travel time. Measures for reducing travel time need to be considered in policy-making to re-evaluate the current locations of tertiary care centres to provide equality of access to emergency medicine. </p...|$|E

Time of induction, surgical and recovery events were recorded, and physiological parameters measured and recorded. Analgesia was evaluated with a visual analogue scale, a composite scoring system and the von Frey mechanical threshold device every hour from three to eight hours post-drug administration. injection. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed model, Kruskal Wallis or Chi-square tests (p< 0. 05). RESULTS Median (range) induction and recovery <b>times</b> (<b>minutes)</b> were not significantly (P= 0. 125) different among the three combinations: 5. 6 (2. 7 - 8. 0), 7. 4 (5. 1 - 9. 6) and 8. 0 (5. 8 - 14. 9) for induction and 128. 5 (95. 1 - 142. 8), 166. 4 (123. 1 - 210. 0) and 142. 9 (123. 4 - 180. 2) for recovery, with MedK, MedKT and MedKM, respectively. Two cats in group MedKM required alfaxalone for intubation. In all groups, 3 or 4 cats required additional isoflurane for surgery, arterial oxygen tension (mean ± SD: 66 ± 2 mmHg) was low, and, surgery increased systolic arterial blood pressure (p< 0. 001), haemoglobin saturation (p< 0. 001), respiratory (p= 0. 003) and heart rates (p= 0. 002), and decreased end-tidal carbon dioxide (p= 0. 003).

Materials and methods Cats received {{a combination of}} medetomidine (60 μg kg- 1) and ketamine (10 mg kg- 1) alone (MedK) or combined with morphine (0. 2 mg kg- 1) (MedKM) or tramadol (2 mg kg- 1) (MedKT) intramuscularly. Time of different events and physiological parameters were recorded by a blinded researcher. Pre-surgery arterial and venous blood gases were measured. Heart rate (HR), respiration rate (fR), systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP), peripheral haemoglobin saturation (SpO 2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO 2) were recorded every 5 minutes of general anaesthesia and at each surgical stage. Post-operative analgesia was evaluated with a visual analogue scale, a multidimensional composite scoring system and a rigid tip von Frey mechanical threshold device every hour from 3 to 8 hours post-injection of the initial combination of drugs. Data were analysed with a linear mixed model, Kruskal Wallis or Chi-square tests (p < 0. 05).

All three combinations caused similar low partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2) values (mean ± SD: 66. 2 ± 1. 7 mmHg). Surgery {{had a significant effect}} on SABP (p < 0. 001), SpO 2 (p < 0. 001), fR (p = 0. 003) and HR (p = 0. 002), which increased; and PETCO 2 (p = 0. 003), which decreased, with all combinations. Non-significant differences were found in pain scores and von Frey results among treatments; however, the von Frey changes over time did vary by treatment (p < 0. 001) with the MedK group returning to baseline values more rapidly than MedKM and MedKT. None of the cats required rescue analgesics. Conclusion and clinical relevance All three protocols provide adequate anaesthesia and analgesia for orchiectomy in cats. However, rescue intervention to maintain surgical anaesthesia such as isoflurane may be required in some cats. Oxygen should be supplemented.
