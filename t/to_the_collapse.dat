40|$|Background. Transthoracic oesophagectomy {{requires}} prolonged one-lung ventilation causing systemic {{and local}} inflammatory responses. Application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> lung potentially reduces pulmonary damage, hypoxia, and consequent inflammation. This randomized controlled trial studied {{the influence of}} CPAP applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> right lung during thoracoscopic oesophagectomy on local and systemic inflammatory response. Methods. Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from <b>the</b> right <b>collapsed</b> and left ventilated lung and serum samples were obtained during surgery from 30 patients undergoing thoracolaparoscopic oesophagectomy for cancer who were randomized for one-lung ventilation with or without CPAP applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> right lung. Concentrations of cytokines and chemokines, in BALE and serum, were determined with Luminex. Results. Patients from the control (no CPAP) group had significantly increased concentrations of interleukin (IL) - 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 alpha, pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC), and IL- 8 in <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> (right) lung when compared with patients from the CPAP group (P < 0. 05). The ventilated (left) lung of the control group showed increased concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1 and MIP- 1 alpha (P < 0. 05). Serum concentrations of cytokines and chemokines increased during surgery, but did not differ between the control and CPAP groups. Conclusions. A significantly lower local immune response was observed during one-lung ventilation when CPAP was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> lung. <b>The</b> findings suggest a beneficial effect of CPAP on <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> lung during oesophagectomy with one-lung ventilatio...|$|R

5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of almost all industry codes.|$|E
