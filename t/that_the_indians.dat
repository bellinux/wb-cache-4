5|$|The Karankawa Indians {{used the}} land near the Guadalupe River delta and San Antonio Bay for camping purposes. They also {{populated}} Matagorda Island {{on the opposite}} side of the bay. Captain Luis Cazorla of Presidio La Bahía crossed San Antonio Bay to visit the island in 1776, and discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> had killed the mates of a shipwrecked British trading vessel. For a short time, he convinced the Indian leaders not to kill shipwreck survivors on the island. An effort was made to convert the Indians with the establishment of Mission Refugio on San Antonio Bay in 1793, after Fray José Francisco Garza found a shallow crossing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> used to travel to the mainland. To prevent the Indians from using Matagorda Island as a hiding place to stage attacks, La Bahía commandant Juan Cortés burned and cut brush around the point of crossing. No permanent colony was ever established on the island.|$|E

She completed her B.A. in English literature at the University of Utah in 1934. There she began to question core Mormon beliefs, such as <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> had originated in ancient Palestine. After graduation at age nineteen, she returned to teach English at Weber College, where she demonstrated excellent potential.|$|E
5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. The colonists demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> supply them with food, wood for construction and firewood, and that they build new houses for the Spanish. In addition, pigs had been introduced by the Spanish and were causing great damage to the natives' maize fields. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E
50|$|Kerr-McGee argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Reorganization Act (IRA) {{required}} the Secretary of the Interior to approve any tribal taxes on non-Indians. They also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA) required BIA approval for taxes.|$|R

5|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{concurring opinion}} <b>that</b> argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> tribes have a {{stronger}} claim on inherent sovereign powers than do individual states.

5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside to withstand a siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|Crawford's {{officers}} held {{a council}} of war. Some argued the abandoned village proved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> {{knew about the}} expedition and were concentrating their forces elsewhere. Others expressed the desire to call off the expedition and return home immediately. Williamson asked for permission to take 50 men and burn the abandoned village, but Crawford refused as he {{did not wish to}} divide his forces. The council decided to continue the march {{for the rest of the}} day, but then to go no further. As the column halted for lunch, John Rose was sent north with a scouting party. Soon, two men returned to report that the scouts were skirmishing with a large force of Indians which was advancing towards the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E

5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} for the following Test and for the tour of South Africa in summer 1966–67. Playing in a side defeated 1–3, Chappell struggled to make an impression. His highest score in ten Test innings was 49, while his five wickets cost 59 runs each. On the advice of Simpson, he ceased playing the hook shot as it was often leading to his dismissal. In the first Test of 1967–68 against India, he failed twice batting in the middle order. Heading into the second Test at Melbourne, Chappell's place was in jeopardy, but he rode his luck to score 151 – his innings contained five chances <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> failed to take. However, {{in the remainder of}} the series, he managed only 46 runs in four innings, so his selection for the 1968 tour of England was based as much on potential as form.|$|E
5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
5|$|Major Francis L. Dade, {{military}} commandant at Key West, received {{intelligence that}} Cuba and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumor. Reports coming from Fort Brooke, near present-day Tampa, noted that Indians {{in the area}} were resisting orders {{from the federal government}} to emigrate to Mississippi, contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E

5|$|One of Shelby's chief {{concerns}} was securing {{federal aid}} {{to defend the}} frontier. Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians. Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be effective. With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> were being stirred up and supplied by the British.|$|E
5|$|The Americans, however, had no {{intentions}} {{of letting the}} British Band escape. The Warrior, a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American allied-Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks. On August 1, the Warrior arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Bad Axe River, where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people. Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation. The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the Warrior was injured.|$|E
5|$|Traveling back to Spain {{to recruit}} more missionaries, he {{continued}} lobbying for {{the abolition of}} the encomienda, gaining an important victory by the passing of the New Laws in 1542. He was appointed Bishop of Chiapas, but served only for a short time before he was forced to return to Spain because of resistance to the New Laws by the encomenderos, and conflicts with Spanish settlers because of his pro-Indian policies and activist religious stances. The remainder of his life was spent at the Spanish court where he held great influence over Indies-related issues. In 1550, he participated in the Valladolid debate in which Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> were less than human and required Spanish masters in order to become civilized. Las Casas maintained that they were fully human and that forcefully subjugating them was unjustifiable.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the width}} of the Tethys Ocean is {{believed}} to have been roughly <b>the</b> same as <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean. It is well-documented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean can provide onshore-moving air masses with enough moisture to support a monsoon-driven environment. Thus, the Tethys should have been able to as well.|$|R
50|$|Indian C. l. pallipes is {{endangered}} and {{its population}} {{is estimated at}} 2,000-3,000. It resembles C. l. pallipes in its outer appearance (morphological features) and its social/reproductive behavior, but it is smaller in size and weighs 25 kg on average, {{which may be the}} lowest of all wolves. It is genetically distinct from C. l. pallipes. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> gray wolf is not the pallipes found in the Middle East and Central Asia. It was therefore proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> gray wolf be reclassified as a separate species Canis indica. In 2016, a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences of both modern and ancient wolves generated a phylogenetic tree which indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indian</b> gray wolf and the Himalayan wolf were the most basal.|$|R

5|$|By September 1767, all {{but four}} Jesuits {{had left the}} Chiquitania, and they went the {{following}} April. The Spanish considered it essential to maintain the settlements as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. The archbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Francisco Ramón Herboso, established {{a new system of}} government, very similar to that set up by the Jesuits. He stipulated that each mission be run by two secular (parish) priests, one {{to take care of the}} spiritual needs while the other was in charge of all other – political and economic – affairs of the mission administration. One change was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> were allowed to trade. In practice, the shortage of clergy and the low quality of those appointed by the bishop – almost all of whom did not speak the language of the local peoples and in some cases had not been ordained – led to a rapid general decline of the missions. The priests also broke ethical and religious codes, appropriated the major part of the missions' income and encouraged contraband trade with the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|Tensions cooled between Wayne and the Kentuckians {{over the}} winter of 1793–94. Wayne noticed that, despite their obstinance, the Kentucky volunteers {{appeared}} to be good soldiers. The militiamen, after observing Wayne, concluded that he– unlike Harmar and St. Clair– knew how to combat the Indians. Wayne augmented his popularity in Kentucky by building Fort Recovery {{over the winter}} {{on the site of}} St. Clair's defeat. The Indians' victory over St. Clair had become a part of their lore and inspired them to continue the fight against the western settlers; Wayne's construction of a fort on this site was a blow to the Indian psyche, and his re-burial of some 600 skulls <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> had dug up and scattered across the area was popular with Kentuckians, since many of their own were among the dead. While Scott came to respect Wayne personally, his friend, James Wilkinson, began an anonymous campaign to tarnish Wayne's image, coveting command of the Northwest expedition for himself. Scott, on leave in Philadelphia at the time, wrote to Secretary of War Henry Knox to defend Wayne's reputation, breaching his friendship with Wilkinson.|$|E
5|$|Three Hieronymite friars, Luis de Figueroa, Bernardino de Manzanedo and Alonso de Santo Domingo, were {{selected}} as commissioners {{to take over}} the authority of the Indies. Las Casas had a considerable part in selecting them and writing the instructions under which their new government would be instated, largely based on Las Casas's memorial. Las Casas himself was granted the official title of Protector of the Indians, and given a yearly salary of one hundred pesos. In this new office Las Casas was expected to serve as an advisor to the new governors with regard to Indian issues, to speak the case of the Indians in court and send reports back to Spain. Las Casas and the commissioners traveled to Santo Domingo on separate ships, and Las Casas arrived two weeks later than the Hieronimytes. During this time the Hieronimytes had time to form a more pragmatic view of the situation than the one advocated by Las Casas; their position was precarious as every encomendero on the Islands was fiercely against any attempts to curtail their use of native labour. Consequently, the commissioners were unable to take any radical steps towards improving the situation of the natives. They did revoke some encomiendas from Spaniards, especially those who were living in Spain and not on the islands themselves; they even repossessed the encomienda of Fonseca, the Bishop of Burgos. They also carried out an inquiry into the Indian question at which all the encomenderos asserted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> were quite incapable of living freely without their supervision. Las Casas was disappointed and infuriated. When he accused the Hieronymites of being complicit in kidnapping Indians, the relationship between Las Casas and the commissioners broke down. Las Casas had become a hated figure by Spaniards all over the Islands, and he had to seek refuge in the Dominican monastery. The Dominicans had been the first to indict the encomenderos, and they continued to chastise them and refuse the absolution of confession to slave owners, and even stated that priests who took their confession were committing a mortal sin. In May 1517, Las Casas was forced to travel back to Spain to denounce to the regent the failure of the Hieronymite reforms. Only after Las Casas had left did the Hieronymites begin to congregate Indians into towns similar to what Las Casas had wanted.|$|E
