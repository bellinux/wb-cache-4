5|$|On January 17, 2011, Young {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the New York Mets worth $1.1 million with the ability to reach up to $4.5 million through incentives. In his first career start with the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters, recording the victory in a 7–1 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also went three for three at <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning. Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list. Following the season, he was a free agent.|$|E
5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single.

Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E

Using the formulas in this paper engineers can easily calculate the critical loads of <b>the</b> stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> rids under <b>the</b> boundary conditions: the opposite sides are fixed and the other opposite sides are simply supported, four sides are simply supported. The formula of critical loads of <b>the</b> stiffened <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> rids under other boundary conditions can be derived using the method in this paper...|$|R
5|$|On June 30, 1959, Musial was {{the batter}} {{in one of}} the oddest plays in {{baseball}} history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling {{all the way to the}} backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's head, so he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Mussina's {{remarkable}} {{results in}} 2008 {{were attributed to}} changes in pitching style. While in the past he was known for painting the outside corner of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a mid-90s four-seam fastball, he began to work {{on both sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> his diminished upper-80s fastball. Additionally, when throwing the fastball, he often used the two-seam grip, which gives the ball late breaking motion. Despite his lower fastball velocity, Mussina maintained a significant differential in pitch speed by also lowering the velocity of his changeup. In addition to those more obvious changes, Craig Brown of The Hardball Times also attributed Mussina's renaissance to excellent control, noting that he was walking fewer batters than ever before and was becoming a ground-ball pitcher {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for unidirectional (0, 10) (sub s) and (90, 10) (sub s) plates, ((0 / 90) (sub 5) (sub s)) plates, and for aluminum plates. Results are also presented for ((+/- theta) (sub 6) (sub s)) angle-ply plates for values of theta = 30, 45, and 60 degrees. The {{results indicate that}} the change in axial stiffness of a plate at buckling is strongly dependent upon cutout size and <b>plate</b> orthotropy. <b>The</b> presence of a cutout gives rise to an internal load distribution that changes, sometimes dramatically, as a function of cutout size coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> orthotropy. In <b>the</b> buckled state, the role of orthotropy becomes more significant since bending in addition to membrane orthotropy is present. Most of <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> cutouts exhibited less postbuckling stiffness than <b>the</b> corresponding <b>plate</b> without a cutout, and the postbuckling stiffness decreased with increasing cutout size. However, some of <b>the</b> highly orthotropic <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> cutouts exhibited more postbuckling stiffness than <b>the</b> corresponding <b>plate</b> without a cutout. These results suggest the possibility of tailoring the cutout size and the stacking sequence of a composite plate to optimize postbuckling stiffness. It was found that <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> large radius cutouts do exhibit some postbuckling strength. The results also indicate that a cutout can influence modal interaction in a plate. Specifically, results {{are presented}} that show a <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> a relatively small cutout buckling at a higher load than <b>the</b> corresponding <b>plate</b> without a cutout, due to modal interaction. Other results are presented that indicate the presence of nonlinear prebuckling deformations, due to material nonlinearity, in <b>the</b> angle-ply <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> theta = 45 and 60 degrees. The nonlinear prebuckling deformations are more pronounced in <b>the</b> <b>plates</b> <b>with</b> theta = 45 degrees and become even more pronounced as the cutout size increases. Results are also presented that show how load-path eccentricity due to improper machining of the test specimens affects the buckling behavior.

Many fans believe the turning point in the Series came in the fifth inning of Game 5, with the Tigers down three games to one, and trailing in the game, 3–2. Left fielder Willie Horton made a perfect throw to home plate to nail Lou Brock (who tried to score from second base standing up), as catcher Bill Freehan blocked <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> his foot.

25|$|To {{prepare for}} an assay, the {{researcher}} fills each well of <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> some biological entity that {{they wish to}} conduct the experiment upon, such as a protein, cells, or an animal embryo. After some incubation time has passed to allow the biological matter to absorb, bind to, or otherwise react (or fail to react) with the compounds in the wells, measurements are taken across all the plate's wells, either manually or by a machine. Manual measurements are often necessary when the researcher is using microscopy to (for example) seek changes or defects in embryonic development caused by the wells' compounds, looking for effects that a computer could not easily determine by itself. Otherwise, a specialized automated analysis machine can run a number of experiments on the wells (such as shining polarized light on them and measuring reflectivity, which can be an indication of protein binding). In this case, the machine outputs the result of each experiment as a grid of numeric values, with each number mapping to the value obtained from a single well.

25|$|Blake's great {{innovation}} in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, {{parts of the}} plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> <b>with</b> an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid {{about a quarter of}} an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.|$|E
