25|$|In January 1921, an {{explosion}} {{on board the}} Standard Oil tanker Ardmore, under repair at the Morse yard, killed four men and injured several others. A year later, another fire, started {{in one of the}} company's garages, destroyed 25 vehicles and two pipe houses, with the total damage estimated at $150,000. In June 1924, a fire at the Morse plant ravaged the steamer Egremont Castle, doing $586,000 worth of damage. Due to problems with the insurance papers in this latter accident, the company was forced <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> entire bill.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, five investors {{formed a}} {{partnership}} called Columbus Hockey Limited, who then submitted an application and a $100,000 fee to the NHL office. The voters of Columbus were considering a referendum {{to build a}} publicly financed arena, a major step toward approval of their NHL bid. When League Commissioner Gary Bettman visited Columbus {{to meet with the}} community's leaders about the franchise proposal, there was concern that the voters might not pass the needed referendum. The civic leaders told Bettman {{that they would not be}} willing <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill for the team if the referendum failed. However, just after the meeting adjourned, John H. McConnell (one of those who entered the bid) privately guaranteed Bettman that an arena would be built, referendum or not.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{government}} {{tried to}} find another private firm to fill the vacuum left by the liquidation of Metronet. However, only TfL expressed a viable interest in taking over Metronet's responsibilities. The case for PPP was also weakened in 2008 when {{it was revealed that}} the demise of Metronet had cost the UK government £2bn. The five private companies that made up the Metronet alliance had to pay £70m each towards paying off the debts acquired by the consortium. But due to a deal struck with the government in 2003, when the PPP scheme began operating, the companies were protected from any further liability. The UK taxpayer therefore had <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> rest of the bill. This undermined the argument that PPP would place the risks involved in running the network {{into the hands of the}} private sector.|$|E

25|$|World War II saw Basildon {{used as a}} billet for troops, {{while the}} park became a {{training}} ground for troops deployed in tank and ground warfare. George Ferdinando continued to live at Basildon during this time. Eric served in the navy {{during the war and}} on his return set about mending the walls that had been damaged by bridging units used on the river and the huge holes left in the demolition area. The house was then requisitioned for the Ministry of Works, whose caretaker stole the lead from the roofs. He was caught and imprisoned for two years. Unfortunately the ministry were only willing to pay back one tenth {{of the cost of the}} repair to the roof and other damage done including a fire. Having lived at Basildon now for twenty years George moved to Shoreham-by-sea in Sussex where he died in 1949, but was buried in Basildon. Unable <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> cost of repairing the house and the inheritance tax the house had to be sold and Eric and family moved to the converted barn house formerly part of the estate. The second Lord Iliffe, who lived in the area, visited the house at this point which was in rather a sad state. However, encouraged by the potential she saw in the mansion, Lady Iliffe persuaded her husband to buy it. This was the beginning of Basildon Park's salvation and renaissance.|$|E

500|$|On 2 December 2005, {{tensions}} between King's and the London School of Economics (LSE) were ignited when at least 200 students from LSE (located in Aldwych near the Strand Campus) diverted {{off from the}} annual [...] "barrel run" [...] and caused an estimated £32,000 of damage to the English department at King's. The Times reported that LSE director Howard Davies attended the fun run event, while LSE claimed that Davies only attended for a short time. King's principal, Sir Rick Trainor, deplored the behaviour, appealed to King's students to remain calm and called for no retaliation. The LSE Students' Union later on 6 December issued a formal apology, condemned the actions, as well as promising <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill for the damage repair.|$|E

500|$|A {{measure of}} the upset he caused to the Dutch {{authorities}} can be gauged by {{the contents of a}} letter from VOC Governor-General Anthony van Diemen to VOC headquarters in Amsterdam in 1636, expressing his concern about plans to send a highly paid lawyer to Batavia to draw up a legal code: [...] Nuyts was held under house arrest by the Japanese from 1632 until 1636, when he was released and sent back to Batavia. During this period he passed the time by mining his collection of classical Latin texts by writers such as Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus to write treatises on subjects such as the elephant and the Nile Delta, exercises which were designed to display rhetorical flair and high style. He also further annoyed Dutch authorities by spending lavish sums on clothing and food, things for which the VOC had <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill.|$|E
500|$|The {{committees}} in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining {{funds for the}} construction of the pedestal. The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete. There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and {{of the fact that the}} gift required Americans <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. Harper's Weekly declared its wish that [...] "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once." [...] The New York Times stated that [...] "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances." [...] Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.|$|E
500|$|The Age of Adz {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Keith Meatto of the Frontier Psychiatrist described the album as [...] "a musical masterpiece that blends analog and digital sounds as it reflects on love and loss, life and death, humanity and divinity". Entertainment.ie's Jenny Mulligan described Stevens as [...] "a strange one, that's for sure, {{but he may}} just be a genius". Uncut commented that the album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either [...] "one {{of the most important}} songwriters of his generation" [...] or [...] "just an infuriating, neurotic show-off". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that although the album [...] "goes a bit barmy and over-the-top" [...] there are some [...] "incredible tune" [...] that are [...] "not only genuinely remarkable, but genuinely enjoyable". Alex Denney of NME similarly commented that the album [...] "conjures just enough moments of heart-stopping gorgeousness <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill for its dizzying excesses". Sam Lewis of the BBC remarked on the same point: that the album is [...] "suffused with individual moments of brilliance", but overall it is [...] "let down by its self-conscious incoherence".|$|E

Charles invited Nell and her escort (a Mr. Villiers, a cousin of Buckingham's) to supper, along with his brother the Duke of York.

2500|$|With {{the loss}} of the Vatican [...] and the pope's other {{temporal}} power, the cardinals were left in a remarkable position. [...] All had been expelled from the city of Rome by the French occupying authorities. [...] They were forced to hold the conclave in Venice, making the conclave the last to be held outside Rome. This followed an ordinance issued by Pius VI in 1798, in which was stated that the conclave, in such a situation, would be held in the city with the greatest number of Cardinals among the population. The night chapel of the Benedictine San Giorgio Monastery in Venice was chosen as the location of the conclave. The city, along with other northern Italian lands, was at the time held by the Archduchy of Austria, whose ruler Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> costs of the conclave. [...] Msgr. Ercole Consalvi was almost unanimously elected as Secretary of the Conclave, since the Secretary of the College of Cardinals was trapped in Rome; Consalvi would prove an influential figure in the election of the new pope.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the stage}} {{parcours}} as such, {{there were no}} major movements off {{the race for the}} first hour of racing, before the weather conditions changed; rain would play {{in the rest of the}} day's proceedings.

[...] Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. [...] The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. [...] To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account <b>to</b> <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> bill. [...] Permits were issued the next day. [...] However, two {{days before the}} event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, [...] "the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract." [...] However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were [...] "some tense moments", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. [...] Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.|$|E
