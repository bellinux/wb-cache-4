He <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. [...] The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. [...] The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a [...] "thing of evil" [...] and a [...] "prophet". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical [...] "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the [...] "Plutonian shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven [...] "still is sitting" [...] on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted [...] "Nevermore".|$|E

2500|$|While at Fort Myer, Virginia Emory {{acted as}} a {{correspondent}} for the Baltimore Sun. His series of five articles, entitled [...] "Reports from a Rookie" [...] and carrying his byline, appeared {{from time to time in}} the Sun, and explained many details of camp life and the rigors of military training of the day. In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, [...] "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here. They fully appreciated what it would mean for a man to leave his family, friends and business for an indefinite period, and it makes a fellow feel proud of being an American when he glances about and <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment of the sacrifices voluntarily assumed by the 2,500 men here and the 38,000 men at the other training camps." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Emperor Altoum, {{father of}} Turandot, {{sits on his}} grand throne in his palace. Weary of having to judge his {{isolated}} daughter's sport, he urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge, but the Prince refuses (Aria – Altoum, the Prince: Un giuramento atroce – [...] "An atrocious oath"). Turandot enters and explains (In questa reggia – [...] "In this palace") that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom [...] "in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men" [...] until she was ravished and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Turandot claims that Lo-u-Ling now lives in her, and out of revenge, Turandot has sworn to never let any man wed her. She warns the Prince to withdraw but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: Straniero, ascolta! – [...] "What is born each night and dies each dawn?" [...] The Prince correctly replies, Speranza – [...] "Hope." [...] The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (Guizza al pari di fiamma – [...] "What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?") The Prince <b>thinks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment before replying, Sangue – [...] "Blood". Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot's anger. She presents her third riddle (Gelo che ti da foco – [...] "What is ice which gives you fire and which your fire freezes still more?"). As the prince thinks, Turandot taunts him, [...] "What is the ice that makes you burn?" [...] The taunt makes him see the answer and he proclaims, [...] "It is Turandot! Turandot!" ...|$|E

60|$|But the {{peculiarity}} of David's psalms, after all, is {{from his}} intense faith in God. God {{is in all}} his thoughts.

It is God he wants, and the light of God's countenance, without which he cannot live, and leaving him in misery, and shame, and darkness, {{and out of the}} darkness he cries--My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And, therefore, everything which happens to him shapes itself not into mere poetry, but into a prayer, or a hymn.|$|E
