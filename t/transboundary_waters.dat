40|$|Governance of <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> {{systems is}} {{complicated}} by factors such as institutional fragmentation, social and environmental change, competing values for and uses of water and power dynamics. These challenges exist in both international and federal transboundary contexts, {{although much of the}} scholarly attention has been on international transboundary watersheds. Sustainable <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance is an important goal given the fact that freshwater ecosystems are among the most rapidly degrading in the world. Governance, the ways in which decisions are made and implemented, can have a critical role to enable sustainability in transboundary watersheds. Many analyses of <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> systems provide only partial accounts of <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance because they focus primarily on the roles of governments and interjurisdictional institutions. Furthermore, analyses of federal <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> systems have not satisfactorily considered the role of power dynamics as possible constraints on <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance. Appreciation of the full complexity of <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance, and factors that constrain and enable sustainable <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance, requires considering governance processes at multiple levels and the variety of actors that may be involved therein. A power-analysis can facilitate consideration of which interests are advantaged in various governance processes that have implications for sustainable <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore factors that constrain and enable sustainable <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance in a federal <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> system. Explicitly assessing multi-level governance processes, and the ways in which power dynamics impact them, facilitates a consideration of their roles and contribution to <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance. This study’s purpose is achieved via the following objectives: 1) identify the jurisdictional levels at which federal <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance takes place in the Mackenzie River Basin, (MRB), Canada; 2) consider the design and performance of an interjurisdictional river basin organization (RBO) in the MRB; 3) determine the ways in which power dynamics impact a) collaboration and b) water use decisions within jurisdictions in the MRB; and 4) assess the role and contribution of a) an RBO, b) collaboration and c) water use decisions within jurisdictions to <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance within the MRB. Single and multiple case studies and qualitative data collection and analysis methods were used to achieve these objectives. Two hundred and ninety-six documents, 30 interviews and personal observations were collected and analyzed to achieve the study objectives. The MRB, a jurisdictionally and ecologically complex federal transboundary system in which three provinces, three territories, a federal government and Indigenous governments have responsibilities for water, provided an excellent empirical context in which to explore these issues. Upstream hydroelectric developments and oil sands mining have emerged as key transboundary concerns in this basin. The multiple perspectives, values, interests and power dynamics among key actors in the basin challenge governance that contributes to sustainability. Furthermore, as a basin that at 1. 8 million km 2 that drains approximately 20 % of Canada’s land mass, a multi-level governance design is essential to achieving coordination and inclusion required to enable sustainable <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance. In fact, a number of multi-level governance initiatives, including an interjurisdictional water management institution, collaborations at various levels and major water use decisions, exist within and among jurisdictions in the basin. They are included as case studies in this dissertation. By considering multi-level governance processes and the ways in which power dynamics impact federal <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> systems, this study makes two major contributions to the <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance literature. First, it demonstrates the need to consider large <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> systems as systems of multi-level governance. Considering the ways in which governance processes at multiple levels interact may be key to identifying factors that constrain and enable sustainable <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance. Second, by undertaking a power analysis of a federal <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> context this study directly challenges assumptions in the literature that the presence of a central government or well-developed regulations within federal jurisdictions can temper federal water conflicts. This study’s assessment of the design and performance of an interjurisdictional institution, the ways in which power dynamics impact collaboration and water use decisions and consideration of the roles and contributions of multi-level governance processes in a federal <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance context provide empirical contributions to the <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> governance literature. The assessment of how power impacts collaboration in transboundary contexts adds a theoretical and empirical contribution to the collaborative governance literature...|$|R

This paper uses Africa as a case study to critically assess past efforts to integrate equity into <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> law. The qualitative characteristics of agreements claiming to consider equity are first compared to those making no such assertion to reveal what differences, if any, exist. The paper then develops a quantitative methodology to measure equity in <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> allocations. This methodology is used to compare codified water allocations in agreements that purport to consider equity with those that do not. The findings reveal that agreements referring to equity differ substantively from others and, in fact, divide water in a more equitable manner.

Central Asia {{is one of the}} regions that are suffering prominent <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> and energy problems in the world. The <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> resource problem is closely related with the socioeconomic development and stability of the whole Central Asia. The interaction between water and energy issues in Central Asia is a critical factor that makes the <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> problem complicated. Five countries in Central Asia are beset with numerous contradictions in distribution and demand of water and energy resources. Similar with Central Asia, Northwest China is characterized by an arid climate, water shortage, and uneven spatial–temporal distribution of water resources. It faces an imbalanced supply–demand of water and energy resources. Many scholars have studied <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> problems in Central Asia (Deng and Long 2011; Gao 2012; Klotzli 1997; Li and Liu 2005; Mosello 2008; Xia et al. 2013; Yang and Wang 2010; Yao and Zhou 2014) as well as related climate changes (Bernauer and Siegfried 2012; Li and Liu 2005; Renat 2007; Malsy et al. 2012), energy problems (Song 2014; Zhang 2008), energy cooperation between China and Central Asian countries and Russia (Xu 2013; Zhang 2009 a, b). Existing studies and research on the <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> problem in Central Asia have focused on water allocation, water management, water conflict and cooperation, and climate changes. Studies about energy problem in Central Asia have emphasized on energy distribution, policy, cooperation (Mao 2013), and diplomacy (Zhu 2011). Nevertheless, only a few research studies on contradiction and coordination between water and energy resources in Central Asia have been reported. The contradiction and coordination between water and energy resources are among the key internal causes of the complexity of the <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> problem. With the accelerated promotion of the proposed “Silk Road Economic Belt” strategy, water and energy problems in Central Asia and Northwest China will pose severe challenges against further socioeconomic development of involved regions. In this paper, the complexity of the <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> problem in Central Asia is discussed based on water and energy distribution characteristics as well as demand features of different countries. Later, disputes and cooperation practices of Central Asian countries in <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> and energy resources are analyzed, and corresponding experiences and lessons have been summarized.

5000|$|Having been a {{long time}} water analyst with {{emphasis}} on the Middle East, he coined the term virtual water in 1993 after having been inspired by Gideon Fishelson from Tel Aviv University, who criticised his government over the amount of water that had been used to produce and export citrus fruits to the European Union. Allan then researched trade figures of Middle Eastern states to conclude that this water-scarce region was only able to survive through large quantities of food imports in grain, livestock etc. Thus, the region was not dependent on its own scarce water resources but could purchase water already embedded in agricultural produce. It was this logic that enabled Tony Allan to challenge the then prevailing thesis that the wars in the next century will be fought over water. In essence he explained how the importation of water embedded mostly in cereals into water-scarce regions of the world via trade explained why wars over water were both unnecessary and unlikely. This opened up a plethora of new research directions for his many graduate students working in water constrained parts of the world. His seminal work entitled The Middle East Water Question: Hydropolitics and the Global Economy [...] captured a lifetime of research and has become a cornerstone for policy-makers and researchers.

It aimed to present a dimension to a basic typology of regional integration by studying the Limpopo basin <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> management in a SADC context. <b>Transboundary</b> <b>water</b> management was taken as a sector approach adopted in SADC regional integration. The objectives of the study were to analyse <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> management in SADC through the Limpopo Agreement of 2003; to establish the relationship of the Limpopo Basinâ€™s <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> management and regional integration in SADC; to analyse the influence of international forces on regional water governance trends; and to investigate the impact of river basin organizations on regional peace, security and sustainable development. The hypothesis in this study was that <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> management in the Limpopo Basin is an opportunity to understand regional integration in SADC. The methodology of study evolved on an issues based approach framed in defining driving forces and pressures (rational) and outlining impacts on states and the responses which have been manifest through various interstate agreements. It traces the movement from bilateral to multilateral cooperation usually in the form of river basin organisations. However, it is noted that bilateral agreements between states continue to be relevant in defining context specific solutions. The research hinged on locating governance and socio economic factors. Governance was about its architecture, river basin organisation resilience and water legislation. Socio economic indicators are linked to economic interdependency, societal well-being and vulnerability. The study enables the identification and explanation of principles, concepts and instruments in the Limpopo basin agreements and SADC regional water sector. Subsequently, state sovereignty has been challenged in SADC through <b>transboundary</b> <b>water</b> management.

To address the aforementioned questions, I Interviewed transboundary water experts of Afghanistan, applied the risk and opportunities to cooperation framework, used the available literature and secondary data on the topic, and used the situation mapping tool for the Helmand Basin case. At present, lack of technical knowledge, data gaps, weak bargaining and negotiation skills relative to co-riparian states, lack of public support to <b>transboundary</b> <b>waters</b> negotiations – due to lack of awareness of the topic - doubts on faithfulness of co-riparian states on delivering benefits, and the existence of various stakeholders of <b>transboundary</b> <b>waters</b> in the Afghan government are the main concerns.
