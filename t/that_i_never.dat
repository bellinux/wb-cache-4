5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E
25|$|The part <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really {{developed}} is {{the death}} of Luke and Leia's mother. I had a backstory for her in earlier drafts, but it basically didn't survive. When I got to Jedi, I wanted {{one of the kids}} {{to have some kind of}} memory of her because she will be a key figure in the new episodes I'm writing. But I really debated whether or not Leia should remember her.|$|E

In an interview with American composer Fred Karlin, Morricone discussed his beginnings, stating, My first films were light comedies or costume movies that required simple musical scores that were easily created, a genre <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> completely abandoned even when I went on to much more important films with major directors.|$|E

25|$|I {{must say}} that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record.

In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E

25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E

500|$|... "Ordinary men {{placed in}} {{extraordinary}} circumstances" [...] is a prevalent theme in The Sword of Shannara. Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction. [...] "y protagonists are {{cut from the}} same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. It was Tolkien's genius to reinvent the traditional epic fantasy by making the central character neither God nor hero, but a simple man {{in search of a}} way to do the right thing. ...

Hill and Switch also produced and provided musical instruments to [...] "Bionic".|$|E
500|$|Love {{possesses}} a contralto vocal range, and her vocal style {{has been described}} as [...] "raw and distinctive". According to Love, she never wanted to be a singer, but rather aspired to be a skilled guitarist: [...] "I'm such a lazy bastard though <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> did that", she said. [...] "I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it". She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her [...] "banshee" [...] screaming abilities. Her vocals have been compared to those of Johnny Rotten, and David Fricke of Rolling Stone described them as [...] "lung-busting" [...] and [...] "a corrosive, lunatic wail". Upon the release of Hole's 2010 album, Nobody's Daughter, Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork compared Love's raspy, unpolished vocals to those of Bob Dylan.|$|E

500|$|In 1754, he {{was elected}} {{a fellow of the}} Society of Antiquaries but by 1760 he was happily married and {{resigned}} his fellowship because [...] "my circumstances at that time were very narrow, my worthy father being alive, and I vainly thought my happiness would have been permanent, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> should have been called again from my retirement to amuse myself in town, or to be of use to the society." [...] When his financial circumstances later improved, he became a patron and collector. He amassed a considerable collection of works of art, many of which had been commissioned and which were selected for their scientific interest rather than their connoisseur value. He had several works by Nicholas Pocock representing topographical landforms, mostly in Wales, and others by the artist Peter Paillou, probably commissioned, representing different climate types. His portrait by Thomas Gainsborough shows him as a country gentleman. Also included in the [...] "Pennant Collection", housed at the National Library of Wales, are many watercolours by Moses Griffiths and John Ingleby, and some drawings by Pennant himself.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Blitz {{wanted the}} film's music to be [...] "sweet {{and a touch}} melancholy and just a step out of rhythm", demonstrating Hal's sense of himself in the world, and to express his teenage angst while [...] "maintain an {{underlying}} sweetness". While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> played... And Jeffrey [...] had gotten a little bee in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at one point I started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E
500|$|Both men {{describe}} Star Trek {{as having}} put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{had to worry about}} work ever since Star Trek went on the air." [...] Nimoy reveals that he was an alcoholic {{at the time of the}} original Star Trek series—something that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E
