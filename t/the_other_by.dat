5|$|In 1523, Hernán Cortés {{organised}} two expeditions towards Central America from Mexico, one by {{land and}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>by</b> sea. He commissioned {{the first to}} Pedro de Alvarado and the second to Cristóbal de Olid. Alvarado initiated the conquest of Guatemala, and then set out on an expedition into Honduras. Olid began the conquest of Honduras' interior, arriving in 1524, but soon set himself up independently of Cortés.|$|E
5|$|On the NBR, {{locomotives}} {{were generally}} rebuilt when their boilers wore out. No. 224 received two new boilers {{in the course}} of its life: one was fitted by Drummond, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>by</b> Holmes. Holmes ultimately rebuilt all of the locomotives: other than no. 224, nos. 420/1 were rebuilt in 1887, nos. 422/3 in 1890 and no. 264 in 1893. No. 224 then received its third rebuilding in 1897. In later years, no. 224 was used on secondary and branch line trains.|$|E
5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from the disputed states.

By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.|$|E

5|$|Two plants {{found near}} Twilight Cove are {{regarded}} as hybrids between A.cuneatus and A.forrestii, the only two Adenanthos species {{to occur in the}} area.

The leaves are triangular and flat like those of A.cuneatus, but the leaves of mature shoots are very long and narrow, and the leaves of younger shoots are deeply lobed.|$|E
5|$|A Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 {{warships}} of over 50 guns, 21 {{of less than}} 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the main port on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between {{the southern tip of}} Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet's fireships were captured, one by the allies and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>by</b> a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>by</b> adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>by</b> NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E
5|$|Copper medals {{were struck}} to commemorate {{each of the}} contestants. The obverse side of these {{contained}} {{a picture of the}} respective fighter; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella! Horrida bella! (a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as wars, horrible wars) and the words Strength and magnanimity in the case of Perrins, and Science and intrepidity for that of Johnson. Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by his employers and says that they bear similarities with the work of a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791.

Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E
