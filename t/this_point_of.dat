5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for both teams to gain a psychological advantage. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the tour, Ring had only taken ten wickets {{at an average of}} 28.30, while McCool had taken 17 at 14.35.

5|$|Although {{the bailout}} support {{programme}} feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, {{to the tune of}} a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and mark the end of the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued €1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield by the end of April 2015.|$|E
5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an operational reserve in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade {{was called in to}} fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent to one or two divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>of</b> which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the {{campaign}} the Bf110s switched from bomber escort to ground-attack since the Polish Air Force {{was all but}} defeated. In this capacity Lent and Kubisch destroyed a twin-engined monoplane on the ground on 5 September and another aircraft, a PZL P.24, on 9 September. On 12 September 1939 he was attacked by a Polish aircraft which shot out his starboard engine. Lent made a forced landing behind German lines. He flew five more missions during the Polish campaign, destroying one anti-aircraft battery. For his actions in the Polish campaign Lent was awarded {{one of the first}} Iron Cross 2nd Class of World WarII on 21 September 1939. I./ZG76 relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British, who had been at war with Germany since 3 September 1939. From early October to middle December I./ZG76 operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr areas before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939.|$|E

Cumberland led 4–2 at half time, having two penalty goals kicked by Harry Bloomfield in the first half, however Western Suburbs goalkicker Jim Abercrombie kicked a penalty goal to equalize, after which George Cribb scored between the post and Bloomfield kicked the goal to make it 9–4. Abercrombie scored another penalty goal to make it 9–6, after which Bloomfield intercepted a pass, kicked the ball and regathered it to score which he also {{converted}} to win the match 14–6. Cumberland won its only game in the premiership season and ever.|$|E
5|$|Hermética was an Argentine thrash metal {{band from}} San Martín, Buenos Aires. It {{was formed by}} bassist Ricardo Iorio in 1987 after his {{previous}} band V8 disbanded. Hermética was signed to the independent record label Radio Trípoli Discos throughout their career. The band's initial lineup consisted of Iorio, vocalist Claudio O'Connor, drummer Fabián Spataro and guitarist Antonio Romano. Spataro left the band in 1988 {{and was replaced by}} Antonio Scotto. This lineup recorded their eponymous album, the first thrash metal album recorded in Argentina. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> their career, Hermética performed mainly in Argentina, except for one concert held in Uruguay. In 1990, they released Intérpretesan extended play which included covers of Argentine rock and tango songs. Both albums were released by Radio Trípoli Discos as a single CD when digital technology became available.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E

5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency care as a branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is the thesis that mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
