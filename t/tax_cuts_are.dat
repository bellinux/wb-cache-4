The immediate effects of a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>are</b> {{a decrease in the}} real income of the government and an increase in the real income of those whose tax rate has been lowered. Due to the perceived benefit in growing real incomes among tax payers, politicians have sought to claim their proposed tax credits as <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> In the longer term, however, the loss of government income may be mitigated, depending on the response of tax-payers. The longer-term macroeconomic effects of a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>are</b> not predictable in general, because they depend on how the taxpayers use their additional income and how the government adjusts to its reduced income.|$|R

The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation released a letter in March 2012 estimating that the Buffett Rule would raise $46.7 billion over the next decade. The divergent estimates come about because of different assumptions about the details of the Buffett Rule.

50|$|Reagan {{came into}} office with a {{national}} debt around $900 billion. Reagan inherited office with high unemployment rates and a public distrust in government. The ERTA was designed to give tax breaks to all citizens in hopes of jumpstarting the economy and helping create more wealth in the country. By the summer of 1982, the double dip recession, return of high interest rates, and ballooning deficity had convinced Congress that the Act had failed to create the results that the Reagan administration hoped. Largely at the initiative of Senate Finance Committee chairman Robert Dole, most of the personal tax cuts were backed out in September 1982 by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). When Reagan left office, the national debt had tripled, to around $2.6 trillion. Author Monica Prasad contends that these kinds of tax cuts became popular among Republican candidates because the cuts were well received by voters and could help candidates get elected.

The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) cut taxes by another $ 350 billion. Subsequent legislation cut taxes by another $ 146 billion in 2004 (WFTRA) and $ 142 billion in 2006 (TIPRA and PPA). 1 The tax cuts total approximately $ 2 trillion over ten years, and that total may be vastly understated if {{some or all of}} the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>are</b> extended beyond their scheduled expiration at the end of 2010. 2 As Congress considers whether to extend the tax cuts, pare them back, or simply allow them to expire as scheduled, an important consideration is how the benefits of the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>are</b> distributed as well as how tax burdens would be altered when options to finance the resulting deficits are considered.
