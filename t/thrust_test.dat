40|$|Research and {{development}} on solid rocket propellant {{were carried out}} extensively on {{the whole process of}} production and performance testing. Solid rocket propellant was produced by using potassium nitrate as oxidiser and sucrose as organic fuel. Press- moulding method was selected to produce the propellant. Based on experiments, {{it was found that the}} compressed moulding method gives more uniform and stable propellant compared to the other method of preparation. Propellant burning rate test and static <b>thrust</b> <b>test</b> were carried out in order to determine the characteristic of solid propellant. Burning rate test was conducted on the standard strand burner test rig under atmospheric pressure. The effect of oxidizer and fuel composition on burning rate was studied. It was found that the burning rate was influenced by oxidizer-fuel (O/F) ratio. There are several characteristic parameters of solid propellant that could be found from the static <b>thrust</b> <b>test.</b> The thrust produced by the rocket motor was measured directly from static <b>thrust</b> <b>test.</b> Based on the propellant with O/F ratio of 65 / 35, the thrust produced was more than 300 N with total impulse of 150. 04 Ns and specific impulse of 154. 8 s.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} sensitivity and specificity of the mastoid vibration test in patients who had suffered an attack of vestibular neuritis. Results were compared with the caloric test and two bedside tests of vestibular function (head shaking test and head <b>thrust</b> <b>test).</b> Results are reported in 28 patients who had a residual vestibular deficit 6 months after acute neuritis and in 25 healthy subjects. Mastoid vibration nystagmus was evoked in 21 patients but not in controls. In these patients, mastoid vibration test had a sensitivity of 75 % and specificity of 100 %. Since one patient had inverted mastoid vibration nystagmus, specificity of identification on the pathological side was 95 %. Sensitivity of the test increased with increasing severity of the vestibular lesion. Indeed, mastoid vibration nystagmus was induced in 93 % of patients with caloric paralysis and in 58 % of those with caloric paresis. Nystagmus could usually be modulated or elicited by stimulation of either mastoid. In the few patients in whom mastoid vibration nystagmus was elicited only from one side, or when there was a clear difference in intensity of the nystagmus induced on the two sides, the stimulated side was more often the affected side. Four patients still showed spontaneous nystagmus. The caloric test was abnormal in 26 / 28 patients (93 %) with paralysis in 16 and paresis in 12; 71 % of patients had a head shaking induced nystagmus: 64 % had an asymmetrical response in head <b>thrust</b> <b>test.</b> In conclusion, mastoid vibration test was overall more sensitive than head <b>thrust</b> <b>test.</b> Mastoid vibration test was slightly less sensitive than head shaking test in patients with severe residual deficit and more sensitive in patients with partial deficit. Mastoid vibration test, a valid, low cost clinical screening test for rapid detection of asymmetrical vestibular function, does not cause patient discomfort. It is suggested that this test be included in the diagnostic workup of all patients with suspected vestibular dysfunction...|$|E

This project focus on and {{discusses}} the study of optimum design based SRM characteristics including the methods of the optimum design selection and fabrication, analysis using COSMOS and static <b>thrust</b> <b>testing.</b> Before that, the researcher has focus on the fundamental of solid rocket motor for designing and fabricating.

The propellant was a mixture of Potassium nitrate and sucrose. The rocket motors were manufactured or fabricated using lathe and milling machine. Then three solid rocket motors were tested to get the thrust and performance. The results show that the increasing of thrust and combustion pressure lead to the decreasing the throat size and increasing the throat length.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{literature review}} {{was conducted to}} determine the diagnostic validity of the criteria for sacroiliac (SI) joint pain as proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Databases were searched up to September 2007. Quality of the studies was assessed using a Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated together with 95 % confidence intervals (0). Statistical pooling was conducted for results of provocative tests. Eighteen studies were included. Five studies examined the pattern of SI joint pain, whereas another 5 examined stressing test specific for SI joint pain. None of the studies evaluated the diagnostic validity of the SI joint infiltration or the diagnostic validity of the IASP criteria set as a whole. in all studies, the SI joint selective infiltration {{was used as a}} gold standard; however, the technique, medications, and required pain relief after the infiltration varied considerably between the studies. Taking the double infiltration technique as reference test, the pooled data of the thigh <b>thrust</b> <b>test</b> (DOR, 18. 461; Cl, 5. 82 to 58. 53), compression test (DOR, 3. 88; Cl, 1. 7 to 8. 9), and 3 or more positive stressing tests (DOR, 17. 16; Cl, 7. 6 to 39) showed discriminative power for diagnosing SI joint pain. Perspective: This review of clinical studies focused on the diagnostic validity of the IASP criteria for diagnosing SI joint pain. A meta-analysis showed that the thigh <b>thrust</b> <b>test,</b> the compression test, and 3 or more positive stressing tests have discriminative power for diagnosing SI joint pain. Because a gold standard for SI joint pain diagnosis is lacking, the diagnostic validity of tests related to the IASP criteria for SI joint pain should be regarded with care.

Methods: 45 patients with SpA, classified according to European Spondylarthropathy Study Group criteria, and 30 healthy volunteers were studied. All patients had clinical evaluation of the SIJ, Bath ankylosing spondylitis (AS) metrology index, Bath AS disease activity index, Bath AS functional index, health assessment questionnaire, patient's and physician's visual analogue scale on global disease activity. Results: Ultrasound showed joint effusion in 38. 9 % of SIJ of patients with SpA and in 1. 7 % of SIJ of controls (p < 0. 001). The presence of IBP was significantly associated with SIJ effusion assessed by US alone or plus at least one SIJ test. SIJ effusion assessed by US alone or plus at least one SIJ test had a positive likelihood ratio (LR) (2. 67 and 4. 04, respectively) for the presence of IBP higher than LR of single clinical tests.
