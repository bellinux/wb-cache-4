5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Rossier's {{views of}} Switzerland {{are held in}} several {{institutions}} and private collections in that country.

He complained at times of <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> effects of the climate on his photographic chemicals {{and some of his}} negatives may have been damaged en route to London from Asia. Though his surviving images are scarce, his importance to the early history of photography in Asia is great. Before his arrival in Japan in 1859, Japanese students of photography had struggled to produce satisfactory images, but Rossier's experience, instruction, and contacts with suppliers of photographic materials were extremely helpful in the development of an autonomous photographic tradition in Japan.|$|E

Scenes set in London's Oxford Street were filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff.

5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> stikhio spirits from other territories.

In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|Initial public {{reaction}} to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–Gifford Pinchot National Forest area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring Oregon not affected by the eruption. <b>The</b> <b>adverse</b> effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The United States Forest Service and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.|$|E

Construction had not yet begun when the Russian Admiralty Board amended the contract on 20 July to shorten the construction time by one year for a payment of an extra 48,000 rubles in response to <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> foreign reaction to the brutal Russian suppression of the revolts in Poland and Lithuania that year. Fearing attack by Britain and France, the Board switched priority to the smaller s shortly afterwards {{in the belief that}} they could be completed more quickly so that progress on Kreml slowed to a crawl once construction began on 2 October. The ship was not formally laid down until 23 December and she was launched on 26 August 1865.|$|E

5|$|Lacking firm {{movement}} {{because of}} weak steering currents, Gordon meandered north-northeast {{in the presence}} of mild west-southwesterly wind shear, unable to strengthen under <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> conditions. By November 11, a trough prodded Gordon to the north-northeast at 8mph (13km/h), and it strengthened by 6mph (9km/h) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea. The trough continued steering Gordon, bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12. Despite the warm waters, Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper-tropospheric shear hindered development, disorganized the upper level circulation, and reduced its winds to 40mph (65km/h).|$|E
5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the wharf, a wave swept three {{people into the}} ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The wharf required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, and in the Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Realising the {{symbolic}} {{significance of the}} dam to the Portuguese, FRELIMO proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force. No direct attacks were ever successful, but FRELIMO had some success in attacking convoys {{en route to the}} site. FRELIMO also lodged a protest with the United Nations about the project, and their cause was aided by negative reports of Portuguese actions in Mozambique. In spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam, it was finally completed in December 1974. The dam's intended propaganda value to the Portuguese was overshadowed by <b>the</b> <b>adverse</b> Mozambican public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace, who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project. The dam also deprived farmers of the critical annual floods, which formerly re-fertilised the plantations.|$|E
