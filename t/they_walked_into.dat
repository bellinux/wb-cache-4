5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E
25|$|The {{response}} {{came from}} Pakse, {{as a company}} of Thai mercenaries trundled down Route 23 to the rescue. They dismounted from their trucks several kilometers short of the battle, and began to route march in. <b>They</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a communist ambush. The mercenaries' extinction was overheard on the radio net. But while this was happening, USAF fighter-bombers arrived with close air support for the Royalists. Among the casualties they inflicted were the destruction of one tank and the damaging of the final one. An estimated 700 PAVN soldiers were killed.|$|E

25|$|Khosrow {{was forced}} {{to pull out of}} Lazica, leaving only a 1,500 man {{garrison}} in Petra to defend the territory while he went to deal with Belisarius in Mesopotamia. In 542, Justinian attempted to make a truce with Khosrow, but rather than sending peace delegates, Justinian sent a massive 30,000 man army into Armenia. Sasanian general Nabed's army of 4,000 was severely outnumbered and {{was forced to}} retreat to the town of Anglon in Armenia. The Byzantine army pursued the Sasanians into the town but to Byzantines' dismay, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> an ambush and were completely routed. This massive defeat in 543 gave Sasanians the offensive in the Lazic war {{as well as in the}} war against Justinian.|$|E
25|$|Moyo (Neil Patrick Harris) - Another gorilla in Tarzan's family. He once {{believed}} Tarzan cared {{more about}} Jane than the family. When Hista, an enormous red python, attacked while Tarzan was with Jane, Moyo managed to chase Hista {{away for the}} time being. When Tarzan returned, he boasted about this one time accomplishment, claimed that Tarzan was too busy being with Jane to protect the family, and challenged Tarzan for leadership of the gorillas. Moyo defeated Tarzan, though only because Tarzan had saved Moyo from an imminent death from being impaled on sharp spikes. Moyo led the family away and, by an error of judgment, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> a tar pit. After some conflict, Moyo and Tarzan cooperated to rescue the family and lure Hista into the tar pit, where the great snake became stuck and sank, killing him and forever ending the python's reign of terror. Moyo reconciled with Tarzan, finally seeing that Jane was part of their family, and stepped down as leader. He promised to wait until {{he was ready to}} try to become leader again. Despite his arrogance and stubbornness, when the elephants and gorillas engage in jungle warfare, Moyo plays a big part in helping Tarzan lead the gorillas to victory. Just as the gorillas are about to triumph, a fire breaks out, and Moyo is the first gorilla to follow Tarzan's lead in putting out the fire.|$|E
500|$|McCrea {{left her}} brother's home and was {{travelling}} {{to join her}} fiancé at Ticonderoga. [...] She had reached the village by the old Fort Edward, but so had the war. She was staying {{at the home of}} Sara McNeil, another Loyalist and an elderly cousin to the British General Simon Fraser. On the morning of July 27, 1777, a group of Native Americans, an advance party from Burgoyne's army led by a Wyandot known as Le Loup or Wyandot Panther, descended on the village of Fort Edward. [...] They massacred a settler and his family, then killed Lieutenant Tobias Van Vechten and four others when <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> an ambush. [...] What happened next is a subject of some dispute; what is known is that Jane McCrea and Sara McNeil were taken by the natives and separated. [...] McNeil was eventually taken to the British camp, where either she or David Jones recognized McCrea's supposedly distinctive scalp being carried by a native.|$|E

500|$|Customarily the ship's surgeon {{took the}} {{position}} of naturalist, and the Beagles surgeon Robert McCormick sought fame and fortune as an explorer. When they first met {{at the start of}} the voyage, Darwin had commented that [...] "My friend [...] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably". <b>They</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent [...] "riding expeditions" [...] with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included [...] "several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.—yellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as far as I can find out." [...] Henslow replied that [...] "The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important." ...|$|E
500|$|U2's initial time at Danesmoate {{was spent}} {{recording}} and refining [...] "extensive demos" [...] that the Edge anticipated {{could turn into}} final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group's songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton. The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno's involvement: [...] "Usually he was in first every morning and he'd start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 —it would be just like a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people when <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the room." [...] One of the first songs worked on was [...] "Heartland", which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band's 1988 album, Rattle and Hum. The arrangements for [...] "With or Without You" [...] and [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer {{for a week or}} two, followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band's musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.|$|E

2500|$|The Yankees' {{home opener}} of the 1978 season, on April 13 against the Chicago White Sox, {{featured}} a new product, the [...] "Reggie!" [...] bar. In 1976, while playing in Baltimore, Jackson had said, [...] "If I played in New York, they'd name {{a candy bar}} after me." [...] The Standard Brands company responded with a circular [...] "bar" [...] of peanuts dipped in caramel and covered in chocolate, a confection which was originally named the [...] "Wayne Bun" [...] as it was made in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The [...] "Reggie!" [...] bars were handed to fans as <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> Yankee Stadium. Jackson hit a home run, and {{when he returned to}} right field the next inning, fans began throwing the Reggie bars on the field in celebration. Jackson told the press that this confused him, thinking that maybe the fans did not like the candy. The Yankees won the game, 4–2.|$|E
2500|$|The band's early song set {{included}} R/soul classics such as [...] "Jump Back", James Brown's [...] "Please Please Please", Smokey Robinson's [...] "You've Really Got a Hold on Me" [...] and Ben E. King's [...] "Stand by Me". The band {{also performed}} two Marriott/Lane original compositions, a fast and loud [...] "Come on Children" [...] and the [...] "speed enhanced" [...] song [...] "E too D", in which Marriott would display his considerable vocal abilities {{in the style}} of his heroes and role models, Otis Redding and Bobby Bland. [...] "E too D", which appears on their first album, Small Faces, is named after the guitar chord structure. On US compilation albums the track is titled [...] "Running Wild". Marriott's unique and powerful voice attracted rising attention. Singer Elkie Brooks was struck by Marriott's vocal prowess and stage presence, and recommended them to a local club owner, Maurice King. Impressed, King began finding them work in London and beyond. Their first out-of-town concert was at a working men's club in Sheffield. Since the crowd was mainly made up of Teddy boys and hard-drinking workers, the band were paid off after three songs. Despondent, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> the mod-orientated King Mojo Club nearby (then owned by a young Peter Stringfellow) and offered to perform for free. They played a set that left the local mods wanting more and started a strong buzz. During a crucial residency at Leicester Square's Cavern Club, they were strongly supported by Sonny & Cher, who were living in London at the time.|$|E
