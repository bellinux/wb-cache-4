40|$|Abstract — The algebra <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> values <b>of</b> type- 2 fuzzy sets {{contains}} isomorphic {{copies of}} the algebra <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> values <b>of</b> type- 1 fuzzy sets and the algebra <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> values <b>of</b> interval-valued fuzzy sets. The algebra <b>of</b> <b>truth</b> values <b>of</b> type- 2 fuzzy sets is not a lattice, but these subalgebras are lattices, and in fact, are complete lattices. There are many other subalgebras that are lattices, for example, the subalgebra of convex normal elements. This paper examines several subalgebras which are lattices, {{with the goal of}} determining {{whether or not they are}} complete. 1 I...|$|R
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> the first thesis but rejecting strongly the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> the second.|$|E

5|$|Ashley is a Riskbreaker, {{a militant}} {{division}} of the VKP responsible for upholding state security and law. Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to her lack of combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> Müllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the present}} Fox Mulder is dismayed to hear what his father was {{involved}} in. He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape hoping that the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> what was done to him may one day be revealed. The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur {{the keys to the}} car and walking away.|$|E
5|$|Calloway {{enters the}} church {{wielding}} explosives, taking the congregation hostage. The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E

5|$|Fenwick's {{beliefs are}} similar to Trollope's own. In his early life, the novelist was a {{supporter}} of the Tractarians. However, beginning in about the mid-1860s, his sympathies tended increasingly toward the Broad church.

5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> his words, man {{has given way}} to hatred, greed, and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E

He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E
