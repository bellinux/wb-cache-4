However, these measures had limited effects on the Lithuanian National Revival, and a sense of the Lithuanian national identity continued <b>to</b> <b>grow.</b> <b>The</b> first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for Lithuania within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E
