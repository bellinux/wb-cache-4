2500|$|On July 19, 2013, a 52-year-old {{woman from}} Dallas, Texas, fell [...] {{to her death}} while riding the New Texas Giant roller coaster. According to one {{eyewitness}} account, the victim, who was overweight, was concerned about being properly secured after boarding the ride because her restraints clicked once while the other restraints click three times. A ride attendant assured her {{that as long as}} she heard a click, it was secure. Other eyewitnesses believed the seat restraint locked into place normally and reported seeing it in the lowered position when the roller coaster returned. Some riders informed investigators that the woman was thrown from the roller coaster as it rounded a turn, and one rider tweeted that he saw the restraint come undone. The ride closed for two months during the investigation. The victim was found on top of the metal roof of one of the coaster tunnels, near the Music Mill Amphitheater. Due to the similarity of Texas Giant and Iron Rattler, Six Flags Fiesta Texas ceased running the new Iron Rattler pending investigation findings from Six Flags Over Texas. In under a month, Iron Rattler reopened on August 14 with seat belts as another added restraint to the two trains. Representatives from Gerstlauer, the German company that designed and built the ride's trains, are planning on participating in the investigation. While Gerstlauer would not discuss specifics of the incident, the company did state that their restraint system could not open while the ride was in motion. Then on September 10, 2013, Six Flags Over Texas released a statement stating that the park has finished its investigation on the recent incident and will reopen the Texas Giant on September 14, 2013. With the reopening of the coaster the park has re-designed the restraint-bar pads and added seat-belts to the three trains and added a <b>test</b> <b>seat</b> at the entrance so riders can test if they are able to ride. The woman's family filed lawsuits against both the park and manufacturer. The park and manufacturer subsequently sued each other saying the other was responsible for the accident. On November 18, 2014, attorneys for the victim's family announced that they had reached an undisclosed settlement with both Six Flags and Gerstlauer, with a spokesperson saying the family [...] "is very pleased with the settlement and appreciates the condolences offered by Six Flags and Gerstlauer".|$|E

During his time in Parliament he established links with the USA and Canada and lectured there on the British Constitution and Parliament. During one lecture trip in Georgia he and Dr Martin Luther King appeared on a local TV station together under the billing of [...] "The Two Dr Kings". He was instrumental in gaining UK support for the UNESCO project of the raising of the temples at Abu Simbel after the flooding of the Nile by the Aswan dam.

500|$|While {{everyone}} may {{walk through}} the queue, all riders {{must be at least}} [...] tall. The ride has no maximum weight limit, and riders can test whether the attraction accommodates their size using <b>test</b> <b>seats</b> at the queue entrance and again {{at the end of the}} queue, which are equipped with red, yellow, and green lights that indicate whether the rider can be accommodated. Persons requiring modified seating on other rides may have difficulty closing the ride's over-the-shoulder harness. If passengers are unable to secure the harness, they are not permitted to ride the attraction. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, Universal has modified the restraint system on some of the seats to accommodate larger guests.

40|$|This {{research}} {{involves the}} investigation of vehicle seat structural dynamics on prediction of subjective ride comfort. Previous studies have indicated fundamental seat resonance {{in the range of}} human sensitivity. In our <b>test,</b> <b>seat</b> possesses three (lateral, fore/aft, twisting) mode shapes below 80 Hz. Although many standards have created subjective ride comfort criteria, they have been developed with dynamically rigid seats. It is therefore important to see if cur-rent standard test procedure is accurate. Seventeen healthy volunteers have participated in the experiment. The experiment was carried out in the form of paired comparison tests. Volun-teers were asked to compare different resonating ride segments with non-resonating ride segments in which measured frequency weighted R. M. S vibration intensity was kept con-stant. From this subjective survey, the results show that the twisting mode has higher level of discomfort perceived by volunteers even when the measured vibration magnitude was kept constant. This clearly shows that the method for ride comfort measurement according to standard may need some improvements and must take into consideration the structural dy-namics of the seat. This is due to current measurement systems&# 039; accelerometer locations and designs. This study aims to provide important experimental data to improve current test standards in the field of whole body vibration and ride comfort...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} current {{projects}} are developing new crash test dummies for rear-end impact testing. The validation {{of such a}} dummy design requires human response data from pertinent test situations. The objectives {{of this study are}} to quantify human head, neck, chest, pelvis and femur mechanical response in a well defined <b>test</b> <b>seat.</b> Another aim is to see how the response varies with seat design and sled speed change during low-speed rear-end collisions. This data is intended {{to be used in the}} validation of the crash test dummy (BioRID I) in rear-end impact situations, with a focus on low delta V (velocity change) collisions. Thirteen human subjects were exposed to 28 rear-end collision sled impacts with velocity changes close to 5 and 7 krn/h respectively. The results showed vertical motion of the subjects' H-point caused by ramping up along the seat, a forward rotat ion of the subjects' femur and maybe a contraction of the subjects' gluteus muscles. A vertical motion of the subjects' torso and head was also observed. This motion was caused by a combination of ramping up along the seat back and the straightening of the thoracic kyphosis. In the first 100 ms after impact, several subjects flexed their head relative T 1. These new data have proven to be useful as validation data for new rear-end impact dummies...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{researchers}} have investigated seat design {{issues for the}} occupants and operators of underground mine transport vehicles relative to whole-body vibration (WBV) and mechanical shock. Considering the ergonomic and engineering improvements made to underground mine shuttle car seats, this study has focused on reducing injury risk by improving seating on transport vehicles such as scoops, mantrips, personnel carriers, and rail-mounted locomotives. Similarly, proposed seat design improvements included layering of various types of viscoelastic foam padding to isolate vehicle occupants and operators from adverse health effects of jarring/jolting exposure. This paper discusses the results obtained from laboratory vibration testing of new seat padding materials in seven configurations at the NIOSH - Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) showing that careful use of configuration and materials can reduce the operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exposure to WBV. In addition, results for four mine transport vehicles are presented from field data collection efforts at a Southwestern Pennsylvania mine showing that a NIOSH based design does reduce the operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exposure to WBV.

Substantial reductions in fatalities occurred in the vehicle model years from the late 1960 s through most of the 1970 s, when federal standards were applied.
