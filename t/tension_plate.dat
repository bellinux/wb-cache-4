Early in his career, Richards recognised the importance of capillary potential to plant-soil relations, and described the principles, construction and operation of the tensiometer. Richards also proposed the <b>tension</b> <b>plate</b> apparatus for determining capillary potential in soil. The tensiometer was developed from the idea of using a semi-permeable, porous ceramic material to balance a pressure potential against a matric potential; once equilibrium had established, the matric potential of the soil could be determined by balancing the pressure potential.|$|E

A number of experimental animal studies have been published {{on the use of}} the <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique. In one animal study, rabbit hind limbs were allocated to either lateral stapling, lateral <b>tension</b> band <b>plating,</b> sham surgery or no surgery. Staple migration was observed after 2  weeks of treatment. No results from the histological analysis were reported apart from the growth plate appearing disturbed between the staple legs. Interestingly, staple hemiepiphysiodesis produced a larger valgus deformity when compared to the <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique. A similar result was observed in another study on rabbits but better grasp in bone was reported for the implants used for <b>tension</b> band <b>plating.</b> In their histological analysis, cellular disorganisation was reported around implants in 9 preparations from a total of 34 femurs. No differences were found between implant types and implant related injuries to the growth plate were not observed. Two porcine animal studies compared stapling with <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> in paired setups similar to the study presented were also reported [19, 20]. Medial hemiepiphysiodesis induced a varus deformity using both techniques but the angulation created was larger using the <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique. Signs of early loosening of staples as well as failure of implanted staples were reported. No histological analysis was included in these studies. A recent study investigated the effect of screw length on the rate of creation of the deformity but found no difference between short and long screws. However, guided growth using the <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique was found to be more efficient overall than staples [21].|$|R
30|$|This {{displacement}} of the fulcrum for growth around the physis would in theory lead to a different load of the physis resulting in a faster correction of the deformity [2, 12]. The <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique appears {{to be safe and}} an approximately 30 % faster correction rate was reported in the first published study on its use [2]. Since then a number of publications have focused on the use of <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> with all studies but one being retrospective. Overall results seem satisfying and the <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique has now partly replaced stapling. The only prospective study published so far comparing staples and <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> (non-randomised) was unable to detect any difference between the treatments [17]. Complications with the <b>tension</b> band <b>plating</b> technique reported so far have been very few. There have been reports on hardware failure, which children suffering from pathological physis such as Blount’s disease seem to be more likely to experience or extrusion of implants during treatment [18].

The specific objectives were to study the water and chloride transfers in this soil, to understand the spatial and temporal variability of these transfers and to produce a data set in this forest site for future modelling. For this, we carried out a field tracer experiment and sprinkled chloride enriched solution over two areas of soil (2 × 66 m 2) in March, 2006. Subsequently, we monitored {{the composition of the}} soil solutions collected by zero <b>tension</b> <b>plate</b> lysimeters and ceramic cup lysimeters installed at depths between 0 and 240 cm, over a period of 18 months. We prove that preferential flow through rapid-mobile porosity and slow transfers by convective flux though slow-mobile porosity coexist in the soils of the experimental plot, and that the time scales brought into play ranged from a few days to a yearly scale. The transfer velocities ranged between 2. 38 mm day− 1 for the slowest convective flux and 600 mm day− 1 for the fastest preferential flows. We also prove that the rapid-mobile porosity represents only a small proportion of the soil volume (the mean of all depths, except 10 cm, was about 11 %) but the quantity of solute transferred, which by-passes {{a large part of the}} rooting zone, may be important (around 17 % of the tracer mass applied). The rapid transfer is mainly governed by the soil moisture combined with precipitation intensities and the slow transfer mainly by the cumulative percolation flux. Both transfers are also characterised by wide spatial and temporal variability. The wide transfer variability may be explained by the hydrodynamic dispersion related to the heterogeneity of the slow and rapid porosities, combined with the impact of the 2006 growing season, which slowed down the tracer displacement. Lastly, the experiment proves that the zero <b>tension</b> <b>plate</b> lysimeters mainly collect rapid drainage water, as preferential flows, while the ceramic cup lysimeters mainly collect slow-mobile water mixed with rapid drainage water...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{means of}} core {{fabrication}} are to glue the laminations or weld them {{to form the}} yoke structure. These means result in good yoke assemblies for shorter (< 0. 6 meter) magnets. However, because of weld distortions or mechanical strength limitations, welding and/or gluing techniques result in cores with poor mechanical precision or limited mechanical strength for longer cores. The SPEAR 3 gradient dipole magnets are up to 1. 45 meters long and require distortions of < 0. 05 mm. Therefore, the SPEAR 3 gradient dipole core design incorporated an assembly technique, originally devised for the PEPI Insertion quadrupoles and later adapted for the ALS gradient magnets.

IWTO-DTM- 66 for the measurement of fabrics using the WCM was accepted at the IWTO Cape Town Congress, South Africa in 2014. Since then, interest has been shown in the technology by yarn manufacturers and buyers for testing yarns before fabric is made, in order to obtain the prickle propensity of a fabric while still at yarn stage. Presentation of the yarn sample to the Wool ComfortMeter is critical. An YG 381 yarn winder was selected for this project because it is a fast and reliable tool for sample preparation.

Average annual DOC fluxes of the 30 AETPLS were 4. 9 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) at 0. 4 m and 2. 4 g C m(- 2) y(- 1) at 1. 2 m depth. The average leachate DOC concentrations were 17 mg C L(- 1) (0. 4 m) and 9 mg C L(- 1) (1. 2 m). The DOC concentrations were unrelated to soil moisture content or average temperature and rarely dropped below 9 mg C L(- 1) (0. 4 m) and 5 mg C L(- 1) (1. 2 m). The variability in cumulative DOC fluxes among the plates was positively related to leachate volume and not to average DOC concentrations at both depths. This suggests that water fluxes are the main determinants of spatial variability in DOC fluxes. However, the largest DOC concentrations were inversely proportional to the mean water velocity between succeeding sampling periods, suggesting that the maximal net DOC mobilization rate in the topsoil is limited. Elevated DOC concentrations, up to 90 mg C L(- 1), were only observed at low water velocities, reducing the risks of DOC-facilitated transport of contaminants to groundwater.

40|$|Abstract Autosomal {{dominant}} osteopetrosis (Albers-Schönberg disease) classically {{displays the}} radiographic signs of osteosclerosis. The main ADO complications involve the skeleton: low-impact bone fractures, scoliosis and hip osteoarthritis. Management of osteopetrosis-related orthopedic problems is a surgical challenge {{due to increased}} bone density. The healing process is very slow in these patients because of bone remodeling defects related to osteoblast function failure. In case of bone deformities, a realignment method should be appropriated to osteopetrosis conditions. This article presents a case report of operative treatment of an 11 -year-old girl affected with ADO, who underwent a simultaneous valgus knee deformity correction of both limbs with medial eight-plate epiphysiodesis. Simultaneous correction of valgus deformity on both limbs using an extraperiosteal <b>tension</b> <b>plate</b> technique for medial tibial hemiepiphysiodesis was performed in a girl of 11. 5 years old with autosomal dominant osteopetrosis. The treatment duration from surgery to complete deformity correction and removal of plates was 18  months. The final aMPTA was 86 ° {{on the right side}} and 85 ° on the left side. The correction rate was 0. 61 °/month (right tibia) and 0. 67 °/month (left tibia). The MAD correction rate was evaluated as 1. 5  mm/month for the right limb and 1. 6  mm/month for the left limb. At the moment of plate removal, one screw was broken because of tight fixation in osteopetrotic bone. But it did not compromise the final result. The latest follow-up visit at the age of 14  years 6  months revealed excellent realignment without any deformity relapse. There was no any functional impairment.

Little is understood, however about the origin, and governing flow paths of the contaminants and their respective transformation processes that affect the water quality of Lake Taupo. In this study we investigate contaminant transport and its small-scale variability in the volcanic vadose zone surrounding the Lake. Lateral and preferential solute transport is analysed to better understand the risks of diffuse groundwater pollution from contaminant sources at the land surface. As part of the investigations into this problem the Spydia experimental facility has been installed under a pastoral agriculture land use in the Lake Taupo region, New Zealand (Barkle et al. 2011). A multiple tracer experiment was conducted at the site and vadose zone drainage volumes were measured using Automated Equilibrium <b>Tension</b> <b>Plate</b> Lysimeters (Figure 1). The chemical composition of the drainage samples was analysed in the laboratory. A dual-domain mixing cell model was set up to simulate the unsaturated advective-dispersive tracer transport at selected monitoring sites for two different bromide-chloride (Br⁻, Cl⁻) tracers that were applied at the land surface at two different regions (Figure 1). Some model parameters were constrained by mixing calculations of the measured total Br⁻ and Cl⁻ load, whereas others were calibrated using the measured Br⁻ and Cl⁻ breakthrough curves and drainage volumes. Multi-objective inverse modelling using the AMALGAM evolutionary search method (Vrugt & Robinson, 2007) showed a significant trade-off between simulated transient Br⁻ and Cl⁻ breakthrough curves and corresponding drainage volumes, but also a compromise solution that fits both objective functions reasonably well. Estimates of parameter and model predictive uncertainty were subsequently derived using the differential evolution adaptive metropolis, DREAMZS adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Vrugt et al., 2011) with a formal Bayesian likelihood function (Wöhling & Vrugt, 2011). Uncertainty bounds derived by this MCMC method simultaneously capture the observed Br⁻ and Cl⁻ breakthrough curves and corresponding drainage volumes. Our results demonstrate that (1) flow and transport in the vadose zone is highly variable, and (2) contaminants at the land surface can travel rapidly through the soil to larger depths and this cannot be described with the classical advection-dispersion equation...|$|E

Some hydraulic (n, θs) parameters and mesotrione DT 50 needed calibration. After calibration, the comparison of the results obtained by the three models indicated that PRZM was not able to simulate properly the water dynamic in the soil profile. On the contrary, PEARL and MACRO simulated generally quite well the observed water pressure head and volumetric water content at the three different depths during wetting periods (e. g. irrigated cropping period) while a poorest performance was obtained for drying periods (fallow period with bare soil and beginning of crop period). Similar water flow dynamics were simulated by PEARL and MACRO in the soil profile although in general, and due to a higher evapotranspiration in MACRO, PEARL simulated a wetter soil than MACRO. For the whole simulated period, the performance of all models to simulate water leaching at 1 m depth was poor, with an overestimation of the total water volume measured in the lysimeter (ranging from 2. 2 to 6. 6 times). By contrast, soil temperature was properly reproduced by the three models. The models were able to simulate the leaching of herbicides at 1 m depth in similar appearance time and order of magnitude as field observations. Cumulative observed and simulated mesotrione losses by leaching were consistently higher than the observed and simulated losses of the less mobile herbicide, S-metolachlor.

Four continuous reinforced concrete beams have been retrofitted with adhesively bonded longitudinal plates and tested in order to illustrate this design approach, to directly compare the performance of longitudinal side <b>plates</b> with longitudinal <b>tension</b> face <b>plates,</b> to compare FRP plating with steel plating, and in particular to illustrate the effect of debonding on the sectional ductility of longitudinally plated continuous RC beams.

40|$|Four horizons (till {{the depth}} of 130 cm) of six typical Hungarian soil {{profiles}} (Fluvic Gleysol, Vertic Gleysol and Orthic Solonetz) were investigated {{in order to determine}} relation between dehydrogenase activity, oxygen diffusion rate (ODR), redox potential (Eh) as well as Fe+ 2 content and the soil water status, and to relate them to the soil utilisation and cultivation type. The experiments were performed with the use of undisturbed soil samples preincubated on the water <b>tension</b> <b>plates</b> at 0, 63, 159 and 500 hPa at room temperature. All the investigated parameters varied widely in the tested soils. Dehydrogenase activity and reduced iron content decreased but ODR and Eh values increased with increasing soil water tension. A close relationship between oxygenation indicators (ODR, Eh and Fe+ 2) and dehydrogenase activity was found. The most sensitive oxygenation parameter for describing the relationship between enzyme activity and soil aeration status appeared to be ODR. The studied soils showed a significant decrease of Eh as well as tendency to diminish their ODR, dehydrogenase activity and reduced iron content due to deep-loosening cultivation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCouple-stresses {{solutions}} are obtained for an infinite <b>tension</b> elastic <b>plate</b> bounded at the interior by an elliptical hole with the static equilibrating tractions. The nominal <b>tension</b> in the <b>plate</b> is uniform along the major axis. The {{selection of the}} Mathieus' functions and the form of weighting functions in the boundary conditions match a particular class of boundary values which reduces upon limiting processes to three special cases. These cases are ones with free stresses on the interior boundary: The couple-stresses solution for the degenerate circle, the couple-stresses solution for the degenerate crack, and the classical solution for the elliptical hole. Of particular interest is the degenerate crack problem. The couple-stresses solution for the degenerate crack {{is the same as}} the classical one of the crack. This is true because couple-stresses are related to curvature; however, no curvature is induced in this crack problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a specific nonlinear system depends on having an accurate model {{of the system and}} an analysis technique that allows exploration of the possible types of behavior. In rotating machinery, the excitation is typically harmonic and the coupling of this excitation with particular system resonances is of interest, as are the responses that result from this coupling. Prior to analysis, accurate models must be determined from measurements. A discrete modeling system identifications technique (NARMAX modeling) is studied and modified to understand and improve its performance in the presence of measurement artifacts such as anti-aliasing filtering, quantization noise and sampling. Necessary excitations for identifications are explored through simulation prior to applying the techniques to two experimental systems: a thin beam oscillating between two magnets and a thin <b>tensioned</b> <b>plate</b> with nearly coincidental natural frequencies. A technique, analogous to continuous-time averaging of differential equations with sinusoidal excitations, is developed to analyze these discrete-time difference equation models. Regions of interesting behavior can be identified as a function of model parameters and excitation parameter variation, thus providing a guide to experimentalists to approach regions where particular nonlinear behavior (i. e., jumps, amplitude modulations, and chaos) may be observed. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{treatment of}} the optical mapping produced by deviated light rays impinging on a perforated orthotropic plate revealed the possibility of proceeding to a direct measurement of transverse Poisson's ratios. This was accomplished theoretically by correlating the transverse, Dt, and longitudinal, D 1, diameters of the pseudocaustic curve created by the boundary of an elliptic opening in a uniaxially <b>tensioned</b> <b>plate</b> of an orthotropic material with the transverse components of the compliance tensor. The theoretical foundation of the method {{was based on the}} exact closed-form solution of the geometry under consideration given by Lekhnitskii and Savin. It was shown that both the dimensions and the shape of the pseudocaustic curve are drastically affected by changes in the values of transverse Poisson's ratios. Thus, the method constitutes a powerful and perhaps unique device for evaluating characteristic parameters related to the thickness of the plate representing the stress field by measuring characteristic lengths along a plane parallel to the middle plane of the plate. Finally, by means of the proposed method one can readily establish the local material principal directions for a solid plate of unknown elastic symmetry and directions of principal axes. © 1992...|$|R
40|$|Background: Guided growth through {{temporary}} hemiepiphysiodesis {{has gained}} acceptance as the preferred primary treatment in treating pediatric lower limb deformities {{as it is}} minimally invasive with a lesser morbidity than the traditional osteotomy. The <b>tension</b> band <b>plate</b> is the most recent development in implants used for temporary hemiepiphysiodesis. Our aim was to determine its safety and efficacy in correcting coronal plane deformities around the knee in children younger than 10 years. Materials and Methods: A total of 24 {{children under the age}} of 10 were operated for coronal plane deformities around the knee with a single extra periosteal <b>tension</b> band <b>plate</b> and two nonlocking screws. All the children had a pathological deformity for which a detailed preoperative work-up was carried out to ascertain the cause of the deformity and rule out physiological ones. The average age at hemiepiphysiodesis was 5 years 3 months (range: 2 years to 9 years 1 month). Results: The plates were inserted for an average of 15. 625 months (range: 7 months to 29 months). All the patients showed improvement in the mechanical axis. Two patients showed partial correction. Two cases of screw loosening were observed. In the genu valgum group, the tibiofemoral angle improved from a preoperative mean of 19. 89 ° valgus (range: 10 ° valgus to 40 ° valgus) to 5. 72 ° valgus (range: 2 ° varus to 10 ° valgus). In patients with genu varum the tibiofemoral angle improved from a mean of 28. 27 ° varus (range: 13 ° varus to 41 ° varus) to 1. 59 ° valgus (range: 0 - 8 ° valgus). Conclusion: Temporary hemiepiphysiodesis through the application of the <b>tension</b> band <b>plate</b> is an effective method to correct coronal plane deformities around the knee with minimal complications. Its ease and accuracy of insertion has extended the indication of temporary hemiepiphysiodesis to patients younger than 10 years and across a wide variety of diagnosis including pathological physis, which were traditionally out of the purview of guided growth...|$|R
