5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997–2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E

5|$|Although Morton {{was able}} to keep the state united during {{the first phase of the}} war, once {{emancipation}} became an issue in 1862, the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections, and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature. Before the new legislature convened in 1863, Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government, secede from the Union, and instigate riots. The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln, <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights, among others. Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the revolt of 1381 was <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war with France. In 1337 Edward III of England had pressed his claims to the French throne, {{beginning}} a long-running conflict that {{became known as the}} Hundred Years' War. Edward had initial successes, but his campaigns were not decisive. Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England. By the 1370s, England's armies on the continent were under huge military and financial pressure; the garrisons in Calais and Brest alone, for example, were costing £36,000 a year to maintain, while military expeditions could consume £50,000 in only six months. Edward died in 1377, leaving the throne to his grandson, Richard II, then only ten years old.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer who opposed the introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} of English control over Scotland, there is some {{evidence}} to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the land. From the fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.|$|E
5|$|Following {{intelligence}} collection, {{higher level}} planning for the operation began on 6 May 1944, after von Weichs had issued his orders. Hitler gave his approval to von Weichs' final plans on 21 May. The order to XV Mountain Corps was issued by Generaloberst Lothar Rendulic, the commander of 2nd Panzer Army, on the same day, leaving only three days for preparation. General der Infanterie Ernst von Leyser, commander of XV Mountain Corps headquartered at Knin, was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation. The ground forces of von Leyser's XV Mountain Corps were significantly reinforced from Army Group F, the 2nd Panzer Army and V SS Mountain Corps reserves. These reinforcements included two panzer companies, the reconnaissance battalions of the 1st Mountain Division (the 54th Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion) and the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division, and most of 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen.|$|E

5|$|For the French, {{despite their}} success earlier at Frauenfeld, {{the action was}} {{considerably}} less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded that he took immediate leave, and remained out of action and command until 22 July. <b>The</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle also demonstrated {{the weakness of the}} French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to move his division to Ney's flanks.|$|E
5|$|In late January {{and early}} February 1942, Galland first planned then {{commanded}} the Luftwaffe's air {{cover for the}} Kriegsmarine Operation Cerberus which was a major success. It earned him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. Over the ensuing years, Galland’s disagreements with Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring {{about how best to}} combat the Allied Air Forces bombing Germany caused their relationship to deteriorate. The Luftwaffe fighter force was under severe pressure by 1944, and Galland was blamed by Göring for the failure to prevent the Allied strategic bombing of Germany in daylight. The relationship collapsed altogether in early January 1945, when Galland was relieved of his command because of his constant criticism of the Luftwaffe leadership. Galland was then put under house arrest following the so-called Fighter Pilots' Revolt, in which senior fighter pilots confronted Göring about <b>the</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air war.|$|E

This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
