The functional complementation {{of the growth}} defect by the exogenous hCAII gene was examined by growth of the <b>transformants</b> {{under the control of}} GAL 1 promoter under the low-CO 2 condition. All the <b>transformants</b> harboring the hCAII expression constructs could grow similarly well, while those with the empty vector showed a severe growth defect (data not shown).|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{expression}} vector regulated by Phlebia brevispora glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and terminator was constructed. A polyethylene glycol transformation method for the ethanol-fermenting white-rot fungus Phlebia sp. MG- 60 was established with high transformation efficiency, and the manganese peroxidase isozyme 2 gene (MGmnp 2) <b>transformants</b> were obtained, showing higher MnP activity than control <b>transformants.</b> MGmnp 2 <b>transformants</b> showed higher selective lignin degradation on Quercus wood powder.|$|R
