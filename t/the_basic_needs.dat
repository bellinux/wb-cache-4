25|$|IIT Kharagpur {{is located}} {{just outside the}} town of Kharagpur, in the Hijli village. The civic {{amenities}} provided to the campus of IIT Kharagpur make it nearly self-sufficient with regards to <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> of the residents. As Kharagpur is a small town, there is limited direct interaction between the campus community and the town. There is also little opportunity for the employment of {{family members of the}} faculty. Unlike some other IITs (such as IIT Bombay), IIT Kharagpur does not restrict outsiders' entry into the campus. IIT Kharagpur provides much of its benefits to the local community through the Rural Development Centre (RDC) located in the campus. Established in 1975, the RDC helps the local community by developing customised technologies. The RDC also co-ordinates the National Service Scheme (NSS) programs in IIT Kharagpur, with the members of NSS taking part in weekly community service activities such as sanitation, road construction, teaching and building educational models.|$|E
40|$|Lack of {{motivation}} {{is a substantial}} productivity cost for organisations and business in generally work {{under the assumption that}} pay predicts performance. Satisfaction of <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> psychological <b>needs</b> has in research demonstrated a positive relationship with a better performance (i. e. Baard et al., 2004). If this is the case in the complex nature of sales work, with its primary focus on goals set (sales target) is yet to be decided. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> psychological <b>needs,</b> health and sales performance. The results emanating from this study on 252 sales people goes against previous research on performance as no significant relationships were found between <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> psychological <b>needs</b> and sales performance. However the study provides a strong empirical confirmation of the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> psychological <b>needs</b> play an important role for health. Overall the results suggest that goal-setting (i. e. sales target) has significant consequences in shaping salespeople's cognitive aspect {{of motivation}}, putting <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> psychological <b>needs</b> behind and may result in impaired health. ...|$|R

2500|$|The EMT {{program in}} the United States began {{as part of the}} [...] "Alexandria Plan" [...] in the early 1970s, in {{addition}} to a growing issue with injuries associated with car accidents. Emergency medicine (EM) as a medical specialty is relatively young. Prior to the 1960s and 1970s, hospital emergency departments were generally staffed by physicians on staff at the hospital on a rotating basis, among them general surgeons, internists, psychiatrists, and dermatologists. Physicians in training (interns and residents), foreign medical graduates and sometimes nurses also staffed the Emergency Department (ED). EM was born as a specialty in order to fill the time commitment required by physicians on staff to work in the increasingly chaotic emergency departments of the time. During this period, groups of physicians began to emerge who had left their respective practices in order to devote their work completely to the ED. The first of such groups was headed by Dr. James DeWitt Mills who, along with four associate physicians; Dr. Chalmers A. Loughridge, Dr. William Weaver, Dr. John McDade, and Dr. Steven Bednar at Alexandria Hospital, VA established 24/7 year-round emergency care which became known as the [...] "Alexandria Plan". It was not until the establishment of American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the recognition of emergency medicine training programs by the AMA and the AOA, and in 1979 a historical vote by the American Board of Medical Specialties that EM became a recognized medical specialty. The nation's first EMT's were from the Alexandria plan working as Emergency Care Technicians serving in the Alexandria Hospital Emergency Room. The training for these technicians was modeled after the established [...] "Physician Assistant" [...] training program and later restructured to meet <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> <b>needs</b> for emergency pre-hospital care. On June 24, 2011, The Alexandria Hospital Celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Alexandria Plan. In attendance were three of the nation's first ECTs/EMTs: David Stover, Larry Jackson, and Kenneth Weaver.|$|E
