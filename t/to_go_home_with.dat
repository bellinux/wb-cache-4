25|$|By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating {{crew had}} {{realized}} their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, {{radio and television}} announcers also noticed that Colorado had scored {{with the help of}} an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not wanting to take this chance, Johnson took the snap and went to a knee, allowing the Buffaloes <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a controversial win.|$|E

25|$|On February 4, Real Madrid {{started the}} month with a 0–1 away win over Getafe. The lone goal, a header, was scored by Sergio Ramos {{in the first}} half. On February 12, Madrid {{extended}} their lead in La Liga to ten points after winning 4–2 at home to Levante, while Barcelona had lost the day before to Osasuna in Pamplona. Levante opened the scoring with a header from Gustavo Cabral. The turning point came after a red card to Vicente Iborra, giving away a penalty which was scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo then added two more goals, including a sumptuous third, before Levante pulled another back through Arouna Koné. Karim Benzema then curled home a fourth for Real to finish the scoring. On February 18, Real Madrid continued their good form in La Liga by beating Racing de Santander at the Bernabéu 4–0. Benzema netted a brace and Ronaldo and Ángel Di María each scored one goal in the comfortable win. Racing played {{over half of the}} game with only ten men after Domingo Cisma received a second yellow card for his second handball of the game and was sent off. On February 21, Real Madrid drew 1–1 with CSKA Moscow {{in the first part of}} their Round of 16 games in Champions League. The game, played in snowy conditions in Moscow, was led by Madrid for the majority of the game with a goal from Ronaldo, but a last-minute equalizer by Pontus Wernbloom denied the victory for the visitors. On February 26, Real Madrid defeated city rival Rayo Vallecano at the Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas by a score of 0–1. The only goal of the game, a back-heel effort by Cristiano Ronaldo, was eventually enough for the visitors <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> the three points in their pocket.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{numerous}} famous watering {{holes in the}} area contributing to the nightlife, including the Corner Grocery Bar, Toad Hall, the Pendulum, the Midnight Sun, Twin Peaks, and the Elephant Walk. A typical daytime street scene of the period is perhaps best illustrated by mentioning the male belly dancers who could be found holding forth in good weather {{at the corner of}} 18th and Castro on [...] "Hibernia Beach", in front of the financial institution from which it drew its name. Then at night, after the bars closed at 2 AM, the men remaining at that hour often would line up along the sidewalk of 18th Street to indicate that they were still available <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> someone (aka The Meat Rack).|$|E
2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
