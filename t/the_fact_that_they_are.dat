5|$|There {{are also}} proper classes with field structure, which are {{sometimes}} called Fields, {{with a capital}} F. The surreal numbers form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a proper class, not a set. The nimbers, a concept from game theory form a Field.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} match, The Allied Powers (Davey Boy Smith and Lex Luger) faced the Blu Brothers (Eli and Jacob). Smith started {{out on the}} offensive, but Jacob gained control with a running bulldog throw. The Blus {{capitalized}} on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> identical twins by switching places while the referee was not looking. Luger came into the match near the end and performed a running forearm smash on Eli. Jacob tried to throw Luger with a powerbomb, but Luger tagged in Smith, who performed a sunset flip to pin Jacob and win the match.|$|E

The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E
5|$|The tiger (Panthera tigris) is {{the largest}} cat species, most {{recognizable}} for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> indigenous {{to some of the}} more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.|$|E
5|$|This {{compliance}} requirement establishes {{that any}} non-federal recipient of federal assistance that passes that assistance, whether in part or in total, to another recipient (known as pass-through entities and subrecipients, respectively) {{is responsible to}} monitor the federal assistance activities of that subrecipient, as well as assure that they are both complying with laws and regulations. This requirement is based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> both equally responsible for federal funds received. Subrecipient monitoring may consist of site visits, regular contact, interviews, meetings and examinations of the subrecipient, as well as requiring that the subrecipient be subject to an annual single audit.|$|E

5|$|Wild trout {{naturally}} reproduce in Hammersley Fork {{from its}} headwaters downstream to its mouth. Great blue herons {{have been observed}} at the headwaters of Hammersley Fork, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more commonly found in large river valleys. Little yellow stoneflies also inhabit it. Brown trout {{first appeared in the}} stream in the 1920s after being stocked in Cross Fork and in the 1940s the brown trout populations significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii usually grows as {{an upright}} bush {{between one and}} three metres (3–10ft) high, {{but it can also}} grow as an openly {{branched}} small tree to six metres (20ft) in sheltered gullies, or as a low, spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range. The bark is a grey-brown colour, smooth and thin, with lenticels. The leaves are long and thin, from three to ten centimetres (1–5in) long, and five to ten millimetres (–in) wide. Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside, they are easily recognised by their feather-like appearance, caused by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> finely divided almost back to the midrib, into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes.|$|E

25|$|Viruses {{can remain}} intact from {{apoptosis}} {{in particular in}} the latter stages of infection.
