25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{bootstrap}} the GNU operating system, Richard Stallman asked Andrew S. Tanenbaum, {{the author of the}} Amsterdam Compiler Kit (also known as the Free University Compiler Kit) if he could use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum told him that while the Free University was free, the compiler was not, Stallman decided to write his own. Stallman's initial plan was to rewrite an existing compiler from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory from Pastel to C with some help from Len Tower and others. Stallman wrote a new C front end for the Livermore compiler, but then realized that it required megabytes of stack space, an impossibility on a 68000 Unix system with only 64KB, and concluded he would have to write a new compiler from scratch. None of <b>the</b> <b>Pastel</b> compiler code ended up in GCC, though Stallman did use the C front end he had written.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>pastel</b> {{shades of}} {{turquoise}} have endeared it to many great cultures of antiquity: it has adorned {{the rulers of}} Ancient Egypt, the Aztecs (and possibly other Pre-Columbian Mesoamericans), Persia, Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, {{and to some extent}} in ancient China since at least the Shang Dynasty. Despite being one of the oldest gems, probably first introduced to Europe (through Turkey) with other Silk Road novelties, turquoise did not become important as an ornamental stone in the West until the 14th century, following a decline in the Roman Catholic Church's influence which allowed the use of turquoise in secular jewellery. It was apparently unknown in India until the Mughal period, and unknown in Japan until the 18th century. A common belief shared by many of these civilizations held that turquoise possessed certain prophylactic qualities; it was thought to change colour with the wearer's health and protect him or her from untoward forces.|$|E

500|$|According to O'Brien, {{the general}} {{critical}} consensus about Bedtime Stories was [...] "Madonna in retreat.

She combined this to startling effect with the music video for 'Secret'." [...] Madonna knew that a lot was riding on her first visual after the Erotica era, and wanted to create an effect with it. The video was directed by Melodie McDaniel, who had previously gained acclaim as a photographer for album artwork and also as music video director for bands like The Cranberries and Porno for Pyros. However, Madonna was more interested in one of McDaniel's earlier short films, where she portrayed baptism combining with voodoo rituals.

500|$|Symphony No. 5 is an {{abstract}} segment created by Pixote Hunt with story development by Kelvin Yasuda. In December 1997, after rejecting pitches from four other animators, Disney and Ernst asked Hunt for his ideas. Hunt first {{thought of the}} story on a morning walk in Pasadena, California, one depicting a battle of [...] "good" [...] multi-colored shapes against [...] "evil" [...] dark ones and how the conflict resolves itself. It took Hunt approximately two years, from start to finish, to complete the segment. Disney and Ernst decided to go with Hunt's idea; Hunt avoided producing an entirely abstract work because [...] "you can get something abstract on every computer screen" [...] with ease. Hunt divided the segment into 31 mini-scenes, noting down points {{in which he would}} employ vivid color when the music was bright and fluid, and then switch to darker hues when the music felt darker and denser. To gain inspiration in how the shapes would move, Hunt and his associates visited San Diego Zoo, a butterfly farm, and observed slow motion footage of bats. The segment combines hand drawn backgrounds using pastels and paint that were scanned into the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and computer-generated imagery (CGI) of abstract shapes and effects, which were layered on top. Hunt explained that scanning each drawing [...] "was a one-shot deal" [...] as the platen that pressed onto it would alter <b>the</b> <b>pastel</b> once it had been scanned. At one point during production, Hunt and Yasuda completed 68 pastel drawings in eight days. The segment was produced using Houdini animation software.|$|E
