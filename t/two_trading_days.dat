40|$|Abstract – We {{argue that}} the impact of capital gains {{taxation}} on asset pricing depends on the tax awareness of market participants. While institutional investors should be generally well-informed about tax regulations, private investors have only limited tax knowledge and resources. As a result, market reactions on tax law changes may be delayed if a considerable fraction of market participants is not fully tax-aware. In line with our argument, we find evidence that the introduction of a previously announced German flat tax on private capital gains in 2009 resulted in a temporarily strong and significant increase of trading volumes, daily returns and asset prices. Our research implies that tax law changes provide an opportunity for well-informed investors to generate arbitrage benefits. Corresponding to our estimate, the capital gains tax resulted in an increase demand for shares of 160 % as well as in an price surplus of about 7. 4 % within the last <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> 2008...|$|E

There is significant evidence that, {{relative to a}} benchmark period, institutional investors bought more event firms' shares in the last <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> prior to announcement. Randomization tests show significant differences in institutional {{trading activities}} between event firms and matched control firms, which suggests that some institutions had inside information. Moreover, large trades account for {{a significant proportion of}} daily stock price changes in the last 2. days. The evidence is consistent with the prediction by Holden and Subrahmanyam (1992) that, when multiple informed investors acquire the same piece of information, they will trade aggressively. We also find that over the reform period, the median share value change of event firms is 6 % higher than that of control firms. Our findings have important implications for enforcement of insider trading regulations in China. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} the tax {{capitalization}} effect {{is a function of}} the attention of market participants.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a measure of}} {{individual}} investor sentiment that {{is derived from the}} market for bank-issued warrants. Due to a unique warrant transaction data set from a large discount broker we are able to calculate a daily sentiment measure and test whether individual investor sentiment is related to daily stock returns by using vector autoregressive models and Granger causality tests. Our sentiment measure should be, ex ante, the preferred measure when compared to other sentiment measures proposed in the literature that are based on the closed-end fund discount, stock market transactions, the put-call ratio or investor surveys as it circumvents problems that are associated with the measures used in prior studies. We find that there exists a mutual influence between sentiment and stock market returns, but only in the very short-run (one and <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days).</b> Returns have a negative influence on sentiment, while the influence of sentiment on returns is positive for the next trading day. The influence of stock market returns on sentiment is stronger than vice versa.

40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. This paper analyzes the turn-of-the-month (ToM) effect in Turkish equity returns. We show that the ToM effect is strongly significant in BIST 100 index over 1988 – 2014, and distinct from other calendar anomalies. In particular, the mean daily index return is 0. 46 % in the three-day period that covers the last trading day of each month and the first <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> of the next month, and 0. 09 % in the remaining days. The ToM effect is more significant following months with (a) significant information flow and (b) above average market performance, and the fraction of index returns generated within the ToM period increases secularly from 39 % over 1988 – 1996 to 49 % over 1997 – 2005 and to 86 % over 2006 – 2014. A similar month-end seasonal does not exist in index trading volume or realized volatility, ruling out standard liquidity or risk-based explanations. Estimating an e-GARCH model with daily index returns, however, we link the ToM effect to a decline in expected volatility in the days leading to month-turns. These findings resonate best with a story where gradual resolution of uncertainty following high information risk periods releases a large pool of “liquid funds” accumulated during such periods into the equity market, creating an abundance of liquidity and pushing equity prices up...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} the pre-CLNY (Chinese Lunar New Year) {{effect in the}} pre-holiday returns of the Hang Seng index by using simplest generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticty - GARCH (1, 1) model. The period investigated is from 2002 to 2007. This study reveals two major findings. First, by testing the returns on trading days preceding 11 Hong Kong public holidays, empirical results indicates that pre-holiday returns are significant higher than mean returns of any other trading days and therefore implying unusual returns patterns for Hang Seng index on trading days prior to holidays closing. The second results of this paper are consistent with prior research in {{that there is a}} strong pre-CLNY effect in many Asian stock markets especially in Hong Kong market. Strong evidence shows the highest mean returns can be achieved on <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> immediately prior to Chinese Lunar New Year and this effect tend to be more persistent compared to other pre-holiday returns over the sample period in Hong Kong stock market. Three related explanations including cultural effect, positive holiday sentiment and bonus payment factor play important role in explaining the significant pre-CLNY effect. The current empirical findings benefit both big investment institutions and small individual stock traders. Hence, investors may able to improve their returns by taking better trading strategy and drawing more profitable decisions based on the presence of pre-CLNY effect in Hong Kong stock market. The investment suggestion recommended in the study suggests investors selling stocks out on two days prior to Chinese Lunar New Year as it generates the highest return. In other words, it is also the worst day to purchase stocks...|$|E

The {{evolution}} of gold from a precious metal to {{a means of}} exchange and a financial asset has allowed gold to exhibit unique characteristics from a portfolio management perspective. This research report seeks to analyse the characteristics of gold {{in order to determine}} its feasibility as a safe haven asset, a diversifier or a hedge in the South African capital markets during different economic climates. This study replicates the methodology of Baur and Lucey (2010) and uses two principle regression models to analyse the properties of gold as a safe haven, a hedge or a diversifier for the South African Investor. Despite the general consensus of gold as a safe haven asset, academic research on this topic to date is relatively sparse, especially within a South African context. This study therefore provides empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of gold as a safe haven and a hedge in a South African context. The findings of this research show that, for South African investors investing in South African equities, gold acts as a hedge on average. In relation to the finding for gold as a safe haven or a hedge for the South African bond market, it was found that gold does act as a hedge on average. The findings further demonstrate that for a South African investor, gold does not act as a hedge for international stocks. The portfolio analysis section of this paper demonstrates that the return for gold is positive on the day that an extreme negative shock occurs in the stock market. Furthermore, the safe haven effect of gold is eliminated after <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>day...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of the typical scenarios of the mutual relations among the stock markets considering different regimes on the commodity markets. For the identified scenarios the investment recommendations have been suggested. Considering different regimes the commodity markets go through and the mutual linkage among the stock markets during different situations on the commodity markets, six scenarios of the stock markets' mutual relations have been analyzed. It was shown that during most unstable period, when highly volatile regime prevails simultaneously on the energy, precious metals and non-energy commodity markets, the whole economy becomes to be more tied: the stock market indices demonstrate stronger interdependence, and as a consequence the benefits of diversification begin to fail. During the simultaneous presence of low volatility on all three analyzed commodity markets the agreement between occurrences of highly volatile state of most stock markets, besides the indices within the European region (DAX, CAC 40, IBEX 35), is rather weak. Similarly the correlation within regions and with other regions is weaker comparing with other situations on the commodity markets, so the standard investment strategy can be kept. It was also shown that the interdependence among the stock markets during the period of high volatility on the energy market differs depending on the source underlying the oil price shocks causing higher volatility. The regimes prevailing on the commodity and stock markets during different time periods have been detected by applying Hidden Markov Model methodology. To examine the similarity between the stock market indices in terms of highly volatile regimes' occurrences, Jaccard's similarity coefficient is employed. The correlation among the stock markets was computed by Spearman correlation coefficient. The final part of research is devoted to the model-based approach used to analyze the dependence of the movement direction of SSEC index on other stock market indices between <b>two</b> <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> during different situations on the commodity markets.
