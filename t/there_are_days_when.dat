On Thursdays and Sundays, flights are handled {{in a period}} of a few hours in the mornings and on Saturdays only the evening hours are used.

[...] Santa attire {{was encouraged}} on Saturday, December 13, 2008, and zombie attire was encouraged the next day, {{as part of}} an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for number of zombies on ice. [...] The rink also serves as a host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival; during the festival there is a month of free skating instruction and demonstration at the rink, and there is free dance instructions behind the glass doors of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion stage.|$|E

The couple {{are the parents}} of six young rabbits {{generally}} called The Flopsy Bunnies. Benjamin and Flopsy are [...] "very improvident and cheerful" [...] and have some difficulty feeding their brood. At times, they turn to Peter Rabbit (who has gone into business as a florist and keeps a nursery garden), but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> Peter cannot spare cabbages. It is then that the Flopsy Bunnies cross the field to Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap of rotten vegetables.|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E

60|$|Kells slowly became convalescent {{and then}} he had a relapse.

5000|$|Tracy's failing {{health was}} {{more serious than}} most people are aware of. According to Poitier:"The illness of Spencer {{dominated}} everything. I knew his health was very poor {{and many of the}} people who knew what the situation was didn't believe we'd finish the film, that is, that Tracy would be able to finish the film. Those of us who were close knew it was worse than they thought. Kate brought him to and from the set. She worked with him on his lines. She made sure with Stanley Kramer that his hours were right for what he could do, and what he couldn't do <b>was</b> different each <b>day.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he couldn't do anything. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he <b>was</b> great, and I got the chance to know what it was like working with Tracy." ...|$|R
500|$|During the proceedings, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> several {{thousand}} picketers protested in Foley Square outside the courthouse, chanting slogans like [...] "Adolf Hitler never died/ He's sitting at Medina's side".

60|$|It is a pretty, patriarchal idea: I {{stand between}} the trusting, admiring family and these {{explosive}} stoves {{that are the}} terror of their lives.

50|$|Gopal Chhotray {{dominated}} the Oriya professional theatre {{for more than}} three decades. Beginning with Pheria (Come Back) in 1946, he wrote more than 15 original stage plays and 8 adaptations of eminent Oriya novels, most of which were runaway success in professional stage. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> both the professional theaters of Cuttack, holding daily shows, used to stage his plays concurrently.|$|R
60|$|Then came spring again; the {{southwest}} wind awoke, snow began to go, the grass showed here and there, and Rose's thoughts {{turned back toward}} the coulé. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> every drop of her blood called out for the hills and the country roads, the bleat of lambs, the odor of fields, and the hum of bees, but she kept on at work.|$|R
6000|$|He found Dede a good horsewoman--good {{not merely}} in riding but in endurance. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> they covered sixty, seventy, and even eighty miles; nor did Dede ever claim any day too long, nor--another strong {{recommendation}} to Daylight--did the hardest day ever the slightest chafe of the chestnut sorrel's back.

YOU--you have pride in your bones. My pride will vanish at a laugh. My honour will go at a laugh. I'm just exalted by a crisis. That's all. I'm an animal of intelligence. Soul and pride are weak in me. My mouth waters, my cheek brightens, {{at the sight of}} good things. And I've got a lickerish tail, Benham. You don't know. You don't begin to imagine. I'm secretive. But I quiver with hot and {{stirring}} desires. And I'm indolent--dirty indolent.

6000|$|... "Well, {{some people}} call it {{religion}} and some call it cussedness, begging your pardon, Mrs. Dr. dear, for using such a word. It seems they cannot make out which it is in Harrison's case. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> he growls at everybody because he thinks he is fore-ordained to eternal punishment. And then <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> {{he says he does}} not care and goes and gets drunk. My own opinion is that he is not sound in his intellect, for none of that branch of the Millers were. His grandfather went out of his mind. He thought he was surrounded by big black spiders. They crawled over him and floated in the air about him. I hope I shall never go insane, Mrs. Dr. dear, and I do not think I will, because it is not a habit of the Bakers. But, if an all-wise Providence should decree it, I hope it will not take the form of big black spiders, for I loathe the animals. As for Mrs. Miller, I do not know whether she really deserves pity or not. There are some who say she just married Harrison to spite Richard Taylor, which seems to me a very peculiar reason for getting married. But then, of course, I am no judge of things matrimonial, Mrs. Dr. dear. And there is Cornelia Bryant at the gate, so I will put this blessed brown baby on his bed and get my knitting." ...|$|E
6000|$|And, sure enough, {{the future}} {{brought in a}} lot of trouble. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I used to {{remember}} Captain Giles with nothing short of abhorrence.

60|$|Raoul {{answered}} not {{for some}} time. His eyes were fastened {{on a bright}} star, and a tumult of thoughts began to crowd upon his brain. There are moments {{in the life of}} every man when the mental vision obtains clearer views of remote conclusions, equally in connection with the past and the future, as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> an atmosphere purer than common more readily gives up its objects to the physical organs--leaving the mind momentarily the master, almost without control. One of these gleams of truth passed over the faculties of the dying man, and it could not be altogether without its fruits. Raoul's soul was agitated by novel sensations.|$|E
6000|$|The 'bus that plies between New Romney and Folkestone {{is painted}} a British red and inscribed {{on either side}} with the word [...] "Tip-top" [...] in gold amidst voluptuous scrolls. It is a slow and portly 'bus. Below it swings a sort of hold, hung by chains between the wheels, and in the summer time the top has garden seats. The front over the two dauntless unhurrying horses rises in tiers like a theatre; there is first a seat for the driver and his company, and above that a seat and above that, unless my memory plays me false, a seat. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> this 'bus goes and days when it doesn't go--you have to find out.

60|$|Dr. Blythe did {{laugh at}} the breakfast table--but he never laughed at Miss Oliver's dreams again; for that day brought news of {{the opening of the}} Verdun offensive, and {{thereafter}} through all the beautiful weeks of spring the Ingleside family, one and all, lived in a trance of dread. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> they waited in despair for the end as foot by foot the Germans crept nearer and nearer to the grim barrier of desperate France.|$|R

It was quite a mistake that anything had happened--Mrs. Donner had pulled through unscathed.
