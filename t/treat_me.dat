Although reasons for rejection were generally found unclear, the Government of Sri Lanka cited Rae was [...] "a {{threat to national}} security and sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers rebel group". On the issue, Rae stated: [...] "Sri Lanka is afraid of dialogue, afraid of discussion, afraid of engagement.

500|$|Starting on the {{electric}} piano, Charles played what felt right: {{a series of}} riffs, switching then to a regular piano for four choruses backed up by a unique Latin conga tumbao rhythm on drums. The song changed when Charles began singing simple, improvised unconnected verses ("Hey Mama don't you <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> wrong / Come and love your daddy all night long / All right now / Hey hey / All right"). Charles used gospel elements in a twelve-bar blues structure. Some of the first lines ("See the gal with the red dress on / She can do the Birdland all night long") are influenced by a boogie-woogie style that Ahmet Ertegun attributes to Clarence [...] "Pinetop" [...] Smith who used to call out to dancers {{on the dance floor}} instructing what to do through his lyrics. In the middle of the song, however, Charles indicated that the Raelettes should repeat what he was doing, and the song transformed into a call and response between Charles, the Raelettes, and the horn section in the orchestra as they called out to each other in ecstatic shouts and moans and blasts from the horns.|$|E

He {{previously}} appeared in Casualty as the brother of a patient in 1988. Mantle received much acclaim for his role and was one of the show's most popular characters. He was praised for being entirely convincing as a hospital consultant and very dominant and authoritative in his role, [...] "shouting orders in incomprehensible hospital-speak." [...] Daily Mirror described him as a [...] "heart-throb consultant" [...] and said that the role brought him [...] "an army of female fans". A 2001 poll by the Scottish Sunday Mail voted him 7th on a list of Top [...] "10 heart-throb docs on the box" [...] in a list which included the likes of George Clooney and Goran Višnjić. Mantle has said that during his role as the doctor he received a lot of fan mail, some of which were medically related and asking for his advice, believing him to be a real doctor, but professed that he couldn't even stand the sight of real blood. He has said, [...] "It's funny because people always <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> like a doctor. Not a day goes by without someone coming up to me and asking me for advice."

Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take the crumbs. In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E
