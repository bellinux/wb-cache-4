Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Accords with the Soviet Union, creating the framework of <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E

5|$|The Red Guards, led by Ali Aaltonen, {{refused to}} {{recognise}} the Whites Guard's power status, {{and decided to}} establish a military authority of their own. Aaltonen placed the Red power base in Helsinki. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January 1918, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the Uprising, was lit in the tower of <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Workers' Hall. The large scale mobilization of the Reds {{began in the late}} evening of 27 January, with <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Guard and some of the Guards located along the Viipuri-Tampere railway having become active between 23–26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolsheviks' weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment; 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the Battle of Kämärä in the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918.|$|E

5|$|A bronze {{statue of}} Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925. The {{original}} is {{held at the}} art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. In a widely publicized prank by the students of <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship Vasa when it was lifted {{from the bottom of}} the sea in 1961. Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work Löpare (Runners) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide. Boken om Nurmi (The Book about Nurmi), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman. Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939, while Finnair named its first DC-8 Paavo Nurmi in 1969. Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{position}} that the Baltic states had been forcibly annexed would remain its official stance for the following 51 years. Subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions reaffirmed {{the substance of the}} Declaration. President Dwight D. Eisenhower asserted the right of the Baltic states to independence in an address to the United States Congress on January 6, 1957. After confirming <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Final Act in July 1975, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution that the Final Act would not affect the continuity of U.S. recognition of the sovereignty of Baltic states.|$|E

5|$|There was {{no formal}} legal basis under which a citizen could emigrate from East Germany. In 1975, however, East Germany {{signed up to}} <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Accords, a pan-European treaty to improve {{relations}} between the countries of Europe. An increasing number of East German citizens sought to use the Accords' provision on freedom of movement to secure exit visas. By the late 1980s, over 100,000applications for visas were being submitted annually with around 15,000–25,000being granted.|$|E

5|$|Though Khrushchev's {{strategy}} {{failed to}} achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal {{of the western world}} to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.|$|E
5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and {{it was assumed that}} the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E
5|$|England {{opened the}} year of 1966 on 5 January with a 1–1 draw with Poland at Goodison Park; Ramsey's {{managerial}} ability was demonstrated during the game as the equalising goal came from Bobby Moore, who was allowed to surge forward as Charlton covered the gap he left behind in defence. Charlton played in six of the next seven international victories as England prepared for the World Cup. The run started with impressive victories over West Germany and then Scotland in front of 133,000 fans at Hampden Park. He scored his first international goal with a deflected shot on 26 June, as England recorded a 3–0 victory over Finland at <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Olympic Stadium.

5|$|Ford reluctantly {{agreed to}} run for office in 1976, but first he had to counter a {{challenge}} for the Republican party nomination. Former Governor of California Ronald Reagan and the party's conservative wing faulted Ford for failing to do more in South Vietnam, for signing <b>the</b> <b>Helsinki</b> Accords, and for negotiating to cede the Panama Canal. (Negotiations for the canal continued under President Carter, who eventually signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.) Reagan launched his campaign in autumn of 1975 and won numerous primaries, including North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, and California, but failed to get a majority of delegates; Reagan withdrew from the race at the Republican Convention in Kansas City, Missouri. The conservative insurgency did lead to Ford dropping the more liberal Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in favor of U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States.

Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
