5000|$|Congratulations is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band MGMT, first self-released through MGMTs website on March 20, 2010 with a general release {{following}} on April 13, 2010 by Columbia Records.

MGMT began writing the tracks that would ultimately appear on Congratulations in early 2009. They eventually headed to a Malibu studio to work on the album, with producer Peter Kember (Sonic Boom), an ex-member of Spacemen 3, where vocal contributions from Royal Trux singer Jennifer Herrema were also recorded for the album.

5000|$|Sollee's cello work is {{the element}} that seems to most impact audiences that have not {{previously}} seen him perform. The initial reaction is often one of surprise, if not shock, since most listeners' familiarity with the cello, if any, is in formal classical settings, primarily {{as a part of}} an orchestra. Sollee shows up in a T-shirt instead of a tux. He plucks the cello's strings as frequently as he bows them, plays without printed music, and rarely concentrates his gaze on the instrument while performing. Mostly, he is singing, coordinating with his fellow performers, and connecting with the audience, in much the manner that many guitar players do. In Response to a probe about the uniqueness of what he is doing as a musician, Sollee has said he's [...] "just continued with stuff <b>thats</b> <b>been</b> going on in banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle, and bass" [...] In explaining his bond to the cello, Sollee told CNN interviewer that the cello is [...] "a great Swiss Army Knife...It always does the different things I need it to do in ensembles. I can take the lead. I can play rhythm. It always creates a sound that works in the environment I'm playing in." [...] Sollee's relation to the cello is so intimate that appears almost organic, as if the instrument were merely an extension of his body. (Jon Rieger, Wooden Box) ...|$|E
5000|$|... $5,000 Shopping Spree: After Crystal-Rose {{volunteered to}} for the Photo Hunt, the {{remaining}} players were split into two groups and told to, within three hours, spend exactly $5,000, {{in order to win}} $5,000 for the group kitty. To make this rather transparent task more challenging, numerous rules were put in place: the players couldnt own anything {{at the end of their}} time, they were not to spend more than $1,000 on anything, and they mustnt waste or give away any of the money. Ann-Maree, Bob, and David took a helicopter ride and later a boat ride. Alaina, Marc, and Pete rented a recording studio, drank expensive bottles of wine, and spent $1,000 on a three-course fancy lunch in a private room, complete with butlers and masseuses. They both had a few hundred dollars left with very little time remaining. After going through a few ideas, Ann-Maree, Bob, and David chose to spend their remaining dollars on scratch tickets, and simply put whatever winnings theyd get back into further scratch tickets until their money was all gone. The other group bought a $400 stamp and posted it to the store from which they bought it. The six of them reunited with the host within the time limit and had receipts for exactly $5,000, so it seemed the assignment was won. However, the $400 stamp was determined to have broken either the rule against wastage or the rule against gifts - a postage fee of less than a dollar neednt be paid by $400 worth of stamps, and an antique stamp <b>thats</b> <b>been</b> posted once is not worthless, but merely worth less. Since the rules were broken, the $5,000 they spent came from the kitty.|$|E
