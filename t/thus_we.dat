5|$|Organizations {{may also}} be {{directed}} specifically at influencing persons at some stage of life. <b>Thus,</b> <b>we</b> have midwives and doctors who are legally obliged to deliver the baby; as the child grows, the school, parents, and mass media come to the fore; as they reach working age, various economic organisations pull for the agent's attention; {{the church and the}} institution of marriage impact the actor in obvious ways; and finally, the State may provide a pension to the elderly (Russell 1938:166–168).|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and <b>thus</b> <b>we</b> have no further information {{where it came}} from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on {{an analysis of the}} iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E
5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. <b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> can speak of electric potential {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E
30|$|<b>Thus,</b> all <b>we</b> {{have to do}} is {{to prove}} (3.2).|$|R

60|$|Leaving them <b>thus</b> employed, <b>we</b> {{will return}} to Kambira and his friends.|$|R
25|$|<b>Thus,</b> <b>we</b> want a PostBQP {{algorithm}} {{that can}} {{determine whether the}} above statement is true.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> see how Dominic the Inquisitor, the {{invention}} of Catholic and Protestant polemicists, {{became one of the}} most famous figures in the Black Legend.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thus,</b> <b>we</b> {{see that}} a complex phase gives rise to {{processes}} that proceed at different rates for particles and antiparticles, and CP is violated.|$|E
2500|$|... (As usual, the {{subscripts}} {{are interpreted}} modulo N; <b>thus,</b> for , <b>we</b> have [...]) ...|$|R

5000|$|... (As usual, the {{subscripts}} {{are interpreted}} modulo N; <b>thus,</b> for , <b>we</b> have [...]) ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> have {{obtained}} a slightly stronger conclusion, {{which says that}} in a triangulation T there is an odd number (and at least one) of full-colored triangles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thus,</b> <b>we</b> {{can solve}} {{problems}} in frame B by assuming that Newton's second law holds (with respect to quantities in that frame) and treating Ffictitious {{as an additional}} force.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> {{arrive at}} René Descartes, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, et al.; and the evolved {{forms of the}} {{equations}} of motion that begin {{to be recognized as}} the modern ones.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Thus,</b> if <b>we</b> {{separately}} {{handle the}} case of , the algorithm would take [...] time.|$|R

25|$|Breads made {{of other}} grains have {{descriptive}} names only, <b>thus</b> <b>we</b> have Makai ki roti, Jowar ki roti (barley flour roti), Bajre ki roti (bajra is a grain only grown in India), chawal-ki-Roti (roti of rice flour).|$|E
25|$|Mind against context. The mind is both {{a machine}} and an anti-machine; it is both formulaic and totalizing. <b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> never rest in any context, {{and we need to}} have {{arrangements}} that constantly lend themselves to reinvention.|$|E
25|$|This {{condition}} and the axioms for a group imply that ρ(g) is a bijection (or permutation) for all g in G. <b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> may equivalently define a permutation representation to be a group homomorphism from G to the symmetric group SX of X.|$|E
60|$|And <b>thus</b> did <b>we</b> sail; pleasantly {{reclining}} on {{the mats}} stretched out beneath the canopied howdah.|$|R
30|$|<b>Thus,</b> if <b>we</b> apply Theorem 6.10, {{then we can}} get the conclusion. This {{completes the}} proof.|$|R

25|$|The incomprehensible God {{is known}} through Christ, by faith, {{rather than by}} {{philosophical}} speculations. He manifests God to us, being the expression of His very being, and through him alone, God can be known. The scriptures reveal Him {{to those who have}} faith; and <b>thus</b> <b>we</b> come to know the Holy Spirit as the Divine impulse within us.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{classes of}} Gregorian chant have a {{separate}} musical formula for each mode, allowing {{one section of the}} chant to transition smoothly into the next section, such as the psalm verses that are sung between the repetition of antiphons, or the Gloria Patri. <b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> find models for the recitation of psalmverses, Alleluia and Gloria Patri for all eight modes.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, SA has far {{reaching}} applications, as it {{is necessary}} for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. <b>Thus,</b> <b>we</b> are beginning to see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and anesthesiology.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thus,</b> when <b>we</b> {{only look}} at space alone, it seems that {{randomization}} and nondeterminism are equally powerful.|$|R
60|$|<b>Thus</b> arrayed, <b>we</b> {{were ready}} for Tamai; in whose green saloons we counted upon {{creating}} no small sensation.|$|R
25|$|As we {{can apply}} the same process for {{determining}} if M prints 1 infinitely often. When we combine these processes, we can determine that M does, or does not, go on printing 1’s and 0’s ad infinitum. <b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} other {{mathematical}} concepts {{that can be}} used to represent complete lattices. One means of doing so is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. When this completion is applied to a poset that already is a complete lattice, then the result is a complete lattice of sets which is isomorphic to the original one. <b>Thus</b> <b>we</b> immediately find that every complete lattice is isomorphic to a complete lattice of sets.|$|E
25|$|Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{denounced the}} Pharisees for their {{additions to the}} Law of God. <b>Thus,</b> <b>we</b> must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated {{to have as many}} children as possible? If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.|$|E
