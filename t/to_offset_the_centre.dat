40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{in-cylinder}} airflow, {{and its effects}} on combustion and emissions, in a modern, heavy-duty diesel engine. The in-cylinder airflow is examined experimentally in an optical engine and the flow field inside the cylinder is quantified and shown during combustion, crank angle resolved. Cross-correlation on combustion pictures, with its natural light from black body radiation, has been done to calculate the vector field during the injection and after-oxidation period. In this work, this technique is called combustion image velocimetry (CIV). The quantified in-cylinder flow is compared with simulated data, calculated using the GT-POWER 1 -D simulation tool, and combined with single-cylinder emission measurements at various in-cylinder airflows. The airflow in the single cylinder, characterised by swirl, tumble and turbulent intensity, was varied by using an active valve train (AVT), which allowed change in airflow during the engine’s operation. The same operation points were examined in the single-cylinder engine, optical engine and simulated in GT-POWER. This work has shown that the in-cylinder airflow has a great impact on emissions and combustion in diesel engines, even at injection pressures up to 2, 500 bar, with or without EGR and load up to 20 -bar IMEP. Swirl is the strongest player to reduce soot emissions. Tumble has been shown to affect soot emissions negatively in combination with swirl. Tumble seems <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> swirl <b>centre</b> and <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> is observed also after combustion in the optical engine tests. Injection pressure affects the swirl at late crank angle degrees during the after-oxidation part of the combustion. Higher injection pressure gives a higher measured swirl. This increase is thought to be created by the fuel spray flow interaction. The angular velocity in <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> of <b>the</b> piston bowl is significantly higher compared with the velocity in the outer region of the bowl. Higher injection pressure gives larger difference of the angular velocity. Calculated swirl number from the CIV technique has also been compared with other calculation methods, GT-POWER and CFD-based method. The result from the CIV technique are in line with the other methods. CFD-based calculations, according to [62], has the best fit to the CIV method. The GT-POWER calculations shows the same trend at low swirl number, but at high swirl number the two methods differs significantly. QC 20120302 </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new non-parametric technique for reconstructing the mass distribution in galaxy clusters with strong lensing, i. e., from multiple images of background galaxies. The observed positions and redshifts {{of the images}} are considered as rigid constraints and through the lens (ray-trace) equation they provide us with linear constraint equations. These constraints confine the mass distribution to some allowed region, which is then found by linear programming. Within this allowed region we study in detail the mass distribution with minimum mass-to-light variation; also some others, such as the smoothest mass distribution. The method {{is applied to the}} extensively studied cluster Abell 370, which hosts a giant luminous arc and several other multiply imaged background galaxies. Our mass maps are constrained by the observed positions and redshifts (spectroscopic or model-inferred by previous authors) of the giant arc and multiple image systems. The reconstructed maps obtained for 370 reveal a detailed mass distribution, with substructure quite different from the light distribution. The method predicts the bimodal nature of the cluster and that the projected mass distribution is indeed elongated along the axis defined by the two dominant cD galaxies. But the peaks in the mass distribution appear <b>to</b> be <b>offset</b> from <b>the</b> <b>centres</b> of <b>the</b> cDs. We also present an estimate for the total mass of the central region of the cluster. This is in good agreement with previous mass determinations. The total mass of the central region is M=(2. 0 - 2. 7) 10 ^ 14 Msun/h 50, depending on the solution chosen. Comment: 14 pages(19 postscript figures), minor corrections, MNRAS in pres...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between the galaxy cluster mass M and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect signal D 2 A Y 500 for a sample of 19 objects for which weak lensing (WL) mass measurements obtained from Subaru Telescope data are available in the literature. Hydrostatic X-ray masses are derived from XMM-Newton archive data, and the SZ effect signal is measured from Planck all-sky survey data. We find an MWL–D 2 A Y 500 relation that is consistent in slope and normalisation with previous determinations using weak lensing masses; however, there is a normalisation <b>offset</b> with respect <b>to</b> previous measures based on hydrostatic X-ray mass-proxy relations. We verify that our SZ effect measurements are in excellent agreement with previous determinations from Planck data. For the present sample, the hydrostatic X-ray masses at R 500 are on average ∼ 20 per cent larger than the corresponding weak lensing masses, which is contrary to expectations. We show that the mass discrepancy is driven by a difference in mass concentration as measured by the two methods and, for the present sample, that the mass discrepancy and difference in mass concentration are especially large for disturbed systems. The mass discrepancy is also linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> in <b>centres</b> used by <b>the</b> X-ray and weak lensing analyses, which again is most important in disturbed systems. We outline several approaches that are needed to help achieve convergence in cluster mass measurement with X-ray and weak lensing observations...|$|R
