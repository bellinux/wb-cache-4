25|$|In October 1782, Victory under Admiral Richard Howe was {{the fleet}} {{flagship}} {{of a powerful}} escort flotilla for a convoy of transports which resupplied Gibraltar {{in the event of}} a blockade by the French and Spanish navies. No resistance was encountered on entering the straits and the supplies were successfully unloaded. There was a minor engagement at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> in which Victory did not fire a shot. The British ships were under orders to return home and did so without major incident.|$|E

The aircraft dispatch release from Sorong {{indicated that the}} flight was planned under the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Kaimana, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR).|$|E
25|$|The Hotel Manager and a porter are organising the {{departure}} of the last guests, the Polish family among them. Aschenbach inquires as to their <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> then leaves to sit on the deserted beach where Tadzio and another boy, Jaschiu, are playing. The game becomes rougher and Jaschiu dominates, pushing Tadzio's face into the sand. In an attempt to assist, Aschenbach tries to get up but is too weak. Jaschiu and the other children run away, leaving Tadzio on the beach alone with Aschenbach. Tadzio beckons the author, but he slumps in his chair. Tadzio continues walking far out to sea.|$|E

25|$|At 11:30 pm on {{the night}} of 27–28 January 1919, guards awoke Nicholas Mikhailovich, his brother George and his cousin Dimitri in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them they were to be moved and had to pack their belongings. They {{initially}} assumed {{that they were going to}} be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich even thought that they might be set free, but his brother assumed that they were heading to another place to be shot.

25|$|Later {{investigations}} discovered problems {{concerning the}} state of Sewol at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> The Safety Investigation Report made by the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal noted that Sewol at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> was carrying 2,142.7 tons of cargo when its maximum allowance was 987 tons. TIME magazine further noted that the cargo had been improperly secured. The Report also noted that only 761.2 tons of ballast were taken on board, that some ballast tanks had not been properly maintained, and that the last voyage was made without making further adjustments to the ballast during the journey. Kukmin Ilbo reported that Captain Shin, the regular captain of Sewol, had warned the company about the decrease in stability and passenger satisfaction and attributed it to {{the removal of the}} side ramp. However, Captain Shin claimed that the company responded with threats to fire him if he continued his objections. Captain Shin's warnings were also relayed through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from the company responded to by stating that he would deal with anyone making the claims. The Korea Herald also reported that the captain had requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, which was not done. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Korean Register of Shipping had noted in a stability test report dated 24 January 2014 that Sewol had become 'top heavy and less stable after modifications were made.' The New York Times reported that the company budget for the safety training of the crew was $2 USD, which was used to buy a paper certificate.|$|E
25|$|Haughey's {{victory was}} short-lived, {{as a series}} of {{political}} errors would lead to his demise as Taoiseach. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of Jim McDaid as Minister for Defence, which saw him resign from the post before he had been officially installed, under pressure from O'Malley. Worse was to follow when Seán Doherty, the man who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on RTÉ television, and after ten years of insisting that Haughey knew nothing of the tapping, claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it. Haughey denied this, but the Progressive Democrats members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, that he intended to retire shortly but wanted to choose his own <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> O'Malley agreed to this and the government continued.|$|E

25|$|On {{day four}} of the enquiry, {{evidence}} was given by Imperial Airways Inspector of Engines that no example of the petrol pipe used on the aircraft had been rejected due to internal obstruction leading to reduced flow of fuel. He stated that he was satisfied that the engine was serviceable at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> Captain Barnard, who flew G-EBBY to Paris shortly after the accident had occurred, disagreed with a suggestion put to him {{that there was a}} problem with the engine, saying that he did not think anyone could give a cause for the crash, other than the aircraft having stalled. Further evidence was heard as to the loading of the aircraft. The maintenance regime at Imperial Airways and the reliability of the de Havilland DH.34 were called into question by Mr Beyfus, a legal representative of one of the victims. Two witnesses from the aircraft's insurers gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was to the company's satisfaction. The Imperial Airways manager at Amsterdam corroborated Hinchcliffe's earlier evidence. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.|$|E

Soyer's remarks—he knew both women—show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: [...] "You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging." [...] When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied [...] "with a smile: 'I should {{like to see her}} before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'" [...] Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.|$|E
500|$|The two botanists, or [...] "gardeners", {{were chosen}} by Banks. The chief botanist, David Nelson, was {{a veteran of}} Cook's third {{expedition}} who had been to Tahiti and had learned some of the natives' language. Nelson's assistant William Brown was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French. Banks also helped to secure the official midshipmen's berths for two of his protégés, Thomas Hayward and John Hallett. Overall, Bountys crew was relatively youthful, the majority being under 30; at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure,</b> Bligh was 33 years old. Among the older crew members were the 39-year-old Peckover, who had sailed on all three of Cook's voyages, and Lawrence Lebogue, a year older and formerly sailmaker on the Britannia. The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood, both 15 when they left England.|$|E

Tickets went on sale on March 2. On April 23, 2015, {{it was confirmed that}} Killian Donnelly and Matt Henry would play Charlie and Lola respectively, with other cast members including Amy Lennox as Lauren, Amy Ross as Nicola, Jamie Baughan as Don and Michael Hobbs as George. The West End production became London's first paperless and mobile ticketing operation. Although the show is set in a British Northampton neighborhood, it took a concerted effort to remove Americanisms from the production after its West End spinoff from the Broadway production. In August 2015, booking was extended to February 6, 2016. In October 2015, booking was extended to May 28, 2016. Booking was extended to September 24, 2016 in January 2016. On April 11, 2016, it was extended through January 14, 2017. In January 2017, the show was once again extended through September 30, 2017.

This paper addresses the problems of increased flight delays and aircraft fuel consumption through the integrated control of airport arrival and departure operations.
