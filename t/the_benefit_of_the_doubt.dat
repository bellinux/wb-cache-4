5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the pitcher.|$|E
5|$|The first {{verdict in}} the case was handed down on 29 August 2012 by Judge Jyotsna Yagnik. The special trial court convicted Maya Kodnani, the sitting Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Naroda and former Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat, and Bajrang Dal {{politician}} Babu Bajrangi under Indian Penal Code Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder). It also convicted 30 other people of murder, criminal conspiracy and other criminal charges, and acquitted 29 accused, giving them <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> as there was lack of evidence against them. Kodnai was the first woman, MLA and minister to be convicted in the Gujarat riot case. Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado and accomplices were convicted of rape and murder along with accomplices.|$|E
5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> {{was given to the}} batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E

5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141. Soon after, Compton, the last of the specialist batsmen, nearly departed when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected.|$|E

5000|$|... "So {{the test}} is whether <b>the</b> {{alteration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> articles was in <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company.By what criterion is the Court to ascertain <b>the</b> opinion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders upon this question? The alteration may be so oppressive as to cast suspicion on <b>the</b> honesty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons responsible for it, or so extravagant that no reasonable men could really consider it for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. In such cases the Court is, I think, entitled to treat <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> shareholders as it does <b>the</b> verdict <b>of</b> a jury, {{and to say that}} <b>the</b> alteration <b>of</b> a companys articles shall not stand if it is such that no reasonable men could consider it for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. Or, if the facts should raise the question, the Court may be able to apply another test - namely, whether or not <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders is capable <b>of</b> being considered for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. I cannot agree with what seems to have been <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> Peterson J. in Dafen Tinplate Co. v. Llanelly Steel Co. that whenever the Court and the shareholders may differ in opinion upon what is for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court must prevail. In the present case it seems to me impossible to say that <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> these defendants was either incapable <b>of</b> being for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company or such that no reasonable men could consider it for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. It is idle to say that their action was directed against the plaintiff, because the more outrageous <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> a director <b>the</b> more certain it is that his removal will be bona fide for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, and the more certainly will <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shareholders, acting bona fide and for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company, be directed against him, because it is necessary to protect the company against such conduct for the future. For these reasons I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed." ...|$|R

It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings and it may have been his match total but, giving him <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt,</b> it is the highest individual innings recorded during cricket's pioneering period (i.e., to 1763).|$|E

When asked about the remark prior to the first test, the West Indian captain Clive Lloyd gave Greig <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> surrounding the use of the word grovel.

25|$|A 'probable combatant' {{is someone}} killed at a {{location}} {{and at a time}} during which an armed confrontation was going on, who appears most likely – but not certain – to have been an active participant in the fighting. For example, in many cases where an incident has resulted in a large number of Palestinian casualties, the only information available is that an individual was killed when Israeli soldiers returned fire in response to shots fired from a particular location. While {{it is possible that the}} person killed had not been active in the fighting and just happened to be in the vicinity of people who were, it is reasonable to assume that the number of such coincidental deaths is not particularly high. Where the accounts of an incident appear to support such a coincidence, the individual casualty has been given <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt,</b> and assigned a non-combatant status.|$|E
25|$|Lèse-majesté {{complaints}} can {{be filed}} by any person against anyone else, {{and they must}} always be formally investigated. Details of the charges are rarely made public. A section 112 defendant always meets with obstructions {{from the beginning to}} the end of a case, especially when asking for a provisional release. There are months-long pretrial detentions, and those who are charged are routinely denied bail, remaining in prison for many months awaiting trial. In most cases, convictions result in harsh sentences. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined in August 2012 that the pretrial detention of an alleged lèse-majesté offender violated international human rights law. The courts seem not to recognise the principle of granting <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to defendants. Judges have said that accusers did not have to prove the factuality of the alleged lèse-majesté material, but only to claim it is defaming in any way. Pleading guilty is seen as a move to seek a royal pardon.|$|E
25|$|The {{main point}} of {{contention}} in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to {{make decisions based on}} what they saw in a split second, with <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which {{over the course of a}} long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.|$|E
