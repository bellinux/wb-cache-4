40|$|We {{examine the}} ability of a swarm robotic system to <b>transport</b> cooperatively <b>objects</b> of {{different}} shapes and sizes. We simulate a group of autonomous mobile robots that can physically connect {{to each other and to}} the <b>transported</b> <b>object.</b> Controllers - artificial neural networks - are synthesised by an evolutionary algorithm. They are trained to let the robots self-assemble, that is, organise into collective physical structures and <b>transport</b> the <b>object</b> towards a target location. We quantify the performance and the behaviour of the group. We show that the group can cope fairly well with objects of different geometries as well as with sudden changes in the target location. Moreover, we show that larger groups, which are made of up to 16 robots, make possible the <b>transport</b> of heavier <b>objects.</b> Finally, we discuss the limitations of the system in terms of task complexity, scalability and fault tolerance and point out potential directions for future research.

30|$|The {{problems}} during the loading process (1) are, as stated earlier, the tilting of the robot or the sliding of the handcarts.

Control of the robots when they are pushing has, as stated above, already been proposed, and can be adopted.

A VEX mobile robot kit is utilized to design and construct a prototype robot that is employed in a model object transfer task.

The performance of the designed robot is evaluated by measuring the time taken to transport up to five objects to the goal location. Experimental results indicate that the prototype robot can successfully <b>transport</b> <b>objects</b> to the goal and re-grasp unsuccessfully manipulated objects...|$|R

We report six observations, in two individuals, of a novel tool-use mode not previously reported in non-human animals. Insert-and-transport tool use involves inserting a stick into an object and then moving away, thereby <b>transporting</b> both <b>object</b> and tool. All <b>transported</b> <b>objects</b> were non-food objects. One subject used a stick to <b>transport</b> an <b>object</b> that was too large to be handled by beak, which suggests the tool facilitated object control. The function in the other cases is unclear but seems to be an expression of play or exploration. Further studies should investigate whether it is adaptive in the wild and to what extent crows can flexibly apply the behaviour in experimental settings when purposive transportation of objects is advantageous...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>transporting</b> <b>objects</b> with multiple mobile robots using the concept of object closure. In contrast to other manipulation techniques that are typically derived from form or force closure constraints, object closure requires the less stringent condition that the object be trapped or caged by the robots. Our basic goal in {{this paper is to}} develop decentralized control policies for a group of robots to achieve a condition of object closure, and then, move toward a goal position while maintaining this condition. We present experimental results that show car-like robots controlled using visual feedback, <b>transporting</b> an <b>object</b> in an obstacle free environment toward a prescribed goal. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{weight of}} the <b>transported</b> <b>object</b> is set {{according}} to Ref. [22]: “Efforts shall be made {{for it to be}} no more than approximately 40 % of the weight of an object handled manually by male workers 18  years old or older.” According to Ref. [23], the average body weight of an adult Japanese male in 2013 was 65.8  kg. Assuming that if the robots can <b>transport</b> an <b>object</b> whose weight is 40 % of the person’s weight (approximately 26  kg), they can contribute in reducing the physical burden on people handling heavy objects, the {{weight of the}} hypothetical <b>transported</b> <b>object</b> has been set at approximately 30  kg. The dimensions of the object were roughly calculated as 1.0  m height, 0.5  m width, and 0.5  m depth, which are assumed to be {{the same as that of}} a person. The working environment is assumed to consist of a flat floor, which is the normal home environment. Considering that the corridors in office buildings are at least 1.2  m width [24], the size of the mobile robots was set as a size that would fit in a cube with a side length of 0.6  m, which is approximately half the corridor width, considering that a robot would meet and pass people.|$|R
