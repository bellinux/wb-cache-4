5|$|In the Wii version, players {{control the}} game using the Wii Remote held sideways, {{and the game}} world is rotated by <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> {{controller}} in various directions. The Nunchuk and Classic Controller are also compatible for alternate control schemes. This version also removes the restriction to only rotate in 90 degree intervals and offers three additional levels compared to the PC versions.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
50|$|The vortex {{is given}} a number, called the topological charge, {{according}} to how many <b>twists</b> <b>the</b> light does in one wavelength. The number is always an integer, and can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of <b>the</b> <b>twist.</b> <b>The</b> higher the number of <b>the</b> <b>twist,</b> <b>the</b> faster the light is spinning around the axis. This spinning carries orbital angular momentum with the wave train, and will induce torque on an electric dipole.|$|R

5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
25|$|Ankle sprains {{and wrist}} sprains {{are common in}} wrestling. Ankle sprains {{typically}} occur from <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> ankle and injuring the ligaments within the ankle. Wrist sprains occur from falling hard on the wrist and damaging the ligaments in the wrist.|$|E
25|$|Where it is {{necessary}} to approach a panicking person in deep water, it is advised that the rescuer approach with a buoyant object, or from behind, <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> person's arm on the back to restrict movement. If the rescuer does get pushed under water, they can dive downwards to escape.|$|E

25|$|The {{helicopter}} shot in cricket is {{the act of}} flicking the bat {{toward the}} leg side when facing a yorker or a fuller-length delivery, and finishing the stroke with a flourish by <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> bat in an overhead circle. This shot, which requires excellent timing and wristwork, is considered a newer innovation in cricket, and {{is seen as an}} unconventional form of batsmanship.|$|E
25|$|Rib fractures, {{common in}} breast, {{prostate}} and other cancers with rib metastases, can cause brief severe pain on <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> trunk, coughing, laughing, breathing deeply or moving between sitting and lying. In breast, prostate or lung cancer, multiple myeloma {{and some other}} cancers, sudden onset limb or back pain may indicate pathological bone fracture (most often in the upper femur).|$|E

25|$|Knee {{ligament}} {{injuries are}} a common injury in wrestling. One being an injury to the Medial collateral ligament which {{is also known as}} the MCL and is located on the inside. Another common injury to the knee is on the outside Lateral Collateral Ligament which is known as the LCL. Leg or knee injuries are commonly caused by over <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> leg outward {{from the middle of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|A twist tie is a {{metal wire}} that is {{encased in a}} thin strip of paper or plastic and is used to tie the {{openings}} of bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.|$|E
25|$|The primary modern {{mechanical}} {{actuation mechanism}} uses brake levers coupled to Bowden cables to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed {{areas of the}} cable. Other mechanical actuation mechanisms exist: see Coaster brakes for back-pedal actuation mechanisms, and Rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> end of a handlebar.|$|E

25|$|Focusing can be manual, by <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> {{focus on}} the lens; or automatic, {{activated}} by pressing half-way on the shutter release or a dedicated AF button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards {{in the direction of}} the arrow, the focal-plane shutter (3) opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor (4), after which actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built in drive mechanism re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{peroxides}} can spontaneously precipitate as concentrated crystalline solids {{within a}} storage container for ether. When this solid is formed {{at the mouth}} of the bottle, merely <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> cap may provide sufficient energy for the peroxide to detonate. Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when fresh solvents are used up quickly; they are more of a problem in laboratories which may take years to finish a single bottle. Low-volume users should acquire only small amounts of peroxide-prone solvents, and dispose of old solvents on a regular periodic schedule.|$|E
25|$|This method {{starts to}} fail when the noise source {{is close to}} the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more {{strongly}} and the common-mode rejection of the receiver will fail to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. One pair can induce crosstalk in another and it is additive {{along the length of the}} cable. <b>Twisting</b> <b>the</b> pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged.|$|E

25|$|Pasteur {{noticed that}} {{crystals}} of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, {{half of the}} crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was levorotatory. Pasteur determined that optical activity related {{to the shape of}} the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> light. The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.|$|E
25|$|Following the breakup, Anselmo devoted much of {{his time}} to a {{longtime}} side project, Superjoint Ritual. Having heard this, the Abbott brothers of Pantera (guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul) formed Damageplan with former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals and Bob Zilla on bass. Some fans blame Anselmo for Pantera's breakup, because of statements in the heavy metal press. Anselmo has accused journalists of <b>twisting</b> <b>the</b> facts, publishing what they think sells best. Pantera bassist Rex Brown, widely known as being the one neutral voice in the matter, has blamed both sides for the band's breakup.|$|E
25|$|Doubling and <b>twisting.</b> <b>The</b> silk {{is far too}} fine to be woven, so now it is doubled {{and twisted}} to make the warp, known as {{organzine}} and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with {{each other with a}} light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.|$|E
