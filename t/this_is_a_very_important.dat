In the long term, the projected cost to rehabilitate just the barracks was $1.5 million. But in the short term, there are multiple lower-cost items, like a proposed $15,000 kayak dock or $50,000 to relocate and improve the bathhouse. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> project since Fort Pickering guarded Salem Harbor {{as far back as the}} 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|Catfish {{can produce}} {{different}} types of sounds and also have well-developed auditory reception used to discriminate between sounds with different pitches and velocities. They are also able to determine {{the distance of the}} sound's origin and from what direction it originated. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> fish communication mechanism, especially during agonistic and distress behaviors. Catfish are able to produce a variety of sounds for communication that can be classified into two groups: drumming sounds and stridulation sounds. [...] The variability in catfish sound signals differs due to a few factors: the mechanism by which the sound is produced, the function of the resulting sound, and physiological differences such as size, sex, and age. [...] To create a drumming sound, catfish use an indirect vibration mechanism using a swimbladder. In these fishes, sonic muscles insert on the ramus Mulleri, also known as the elastic spring. The sonic muscles pull the elastic spring forward and extend the swimbladder. When the muscles relax, the tension in the spring quickly returns the swimbladder to its original position, which produces the sound.|$|E

60|$|The six {{descendants}} from (I) {{will form}} two sub-genera or even genera. But {{as the original}} species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants from (I) will, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight descendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, {{are supposed to have}} gone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species, also (and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> consideration), which connected the original species (A) and (I), have all become, excepting (F), extinct, and have left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from (I), and the eight descended from (A), will have to be ranked as very distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families.|$|E
60|$|Richard also {{entered into}} a league, {{offensive}} and defensive, with Tancred, agreeing to assist him in maintaining his position as King of Sicily against all his enemies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> circumstance to be remembered, for the chief of Tancred's enemies was the Emperor Henry of Germany, the prince who had married Constance, as has been already related. Henry's father had died, and he had become Emperor of Germany himself, and he now claimed Sicily as the inheritance of Constance his wife, according {{to the will of}} King William, Joanna's husband. Tancred, he maintained, was a usurper, and, of course, now Richard, by his league, offensive and defensive, with Tancred, made himself Henry's enemy. This led him into serious difficulty with Henry at a subsequent period, as we shall by-and-by see.|$|E
60|$|In these {{chapters}} I have endeavoured to {{show that}} if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate and {{of the level of}} the land, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred--if we remember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of occasional transport--if we bear in mind, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> consideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts--the difficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents. And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by various general considerations, more especially from the importance of barriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of subgenera, genera, and families.|$|E

60|$|I mean by this {{expression}} {{that the whole}} organisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> subject, most imperfectly understood. The most obvious case is, that modifications accumulated solely {{for the good of}} the young or larva, will, it may safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult. The several parts of the body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.|$|E
6000|$|I heard {{also some}} account of an {{engagement}} which took place, {{a few weeks}} previously to the one mentioned, at Cholechel. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> station on account of being a pass for horses; and it was, in consequence, for some time the head-quarters of {{a division of the}} army. When the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of Indians, of whom they killed twenty or thirty. The cacique escaped in a manner which astonished every one. The chief Indians always have one or two picked horses, which they keep ready for any urgent occasion. On one of these, an old white horse, the cacique sprung, taking with him his little son. The horse had neither saddle nor bridle. To avoid the shots, the Indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation; namely, with an arm round the horse's neck, and one leg only on its back. Thus hanging on one side, he was seen patting the horse's head, and talking to him. The pursuers urged every effort in the chase; the Commandant three times changed his horse, but all in vain. The old Indian father and his son escaped, and were free. What a fine picture one can form in one's mind,--the naked, bronze-like figure of the old man with his little boy, riding like a Mazeppa on the white horse, thus leaving far behind him the host of his pursuers! ...|$|E
60|$|I mean by this {{expression}} {{that the whole}} organisation is so tied together, during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> subject, most imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly different classes of facts may be here easily confounded together. We shall presently see that simple inheritance often gives the false appearance of correlation. One of the most obvious real cases is, that variations of structure arising in the young or larvae naturally tend to affect {{the structure of the}} mature animal. The several parts which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary in a like manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some anatomists to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed, it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.|$|E
