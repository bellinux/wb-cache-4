5|$|Although {{cyclones}} take {{an enormous}} <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> lives and personal property, {{they may be}} important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons. Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path, though it also killed 259people and caused $9.14billion (2005 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|In March 1998, {{after the}} closure of Europe's last tin mine at South Crofty in Cornwall (which later reopened for a period, and {{subsequently}} closed), the Cornish Solidarity Action Group (CSAG) encouraged commuters to pay the then-£1 <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> pennies. The group thought this would slow down collection of tolls and cause widespread congestion across the local area. The CSAG believed Cornwall should receive similar subsidies to South Wales and Merseyside, which were receiving regeneration grants from the government.|$|E

5|$|Although Gordon was a {{tropical}} storm {{for most of its}} existence, it caused enormous damage and loss of life. The United Nations estimated death <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> Haiti was 1,122. Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica, five in the Dominican Republic, two in Jamaica, two in Cuba, and eight in Florida. Property damage to the United States was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD). Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available, but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba. The high death toll from Gordon made it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane David in 1979, which killed thousands in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|In extreme western Cuba, {{damage was}} very severe from the strong winds, likened {{to the impact}} of a tornado. Severe damage was {{reported}} in Los Arroyos and Arroyos de Mantua. In the latter location, around a dozen people were killed, 50 were injured, and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop. Across western Pinar del Río Province, the hurricane destroyed all communication links. Further from the center, the capital city of Havana recorded southerly winds of 72mph (116km/h), as well as a minimum pressure of about 999mbar (29.50inHg). Around the country, the hurricane capsized several ships, primarily fishing vessels. The death <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> the country was estimated at around 90. In the days after the storm, Cuban President Zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in Pinar del Río.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|The {{death toll}} was 61 as of October6, {{and a day}} later it reached about 250. The Mexican {{government}} reported 341 deaths on October13, excluding victims in a landslide in Acalama, Puebla, and the total reached 379 by October28. However, non-government agencies reported 500deaths in Mexico by October9, {{and as many as}} 600 as of mid-November. The International Disaster Database, published by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, reported 636deaths from the floods. The high death <b>toll,</b> <b>in</b> comparison to similar floods in 1944, was due to more landslides and flooding in more populated areas. About 500,000people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} {{deaths in}} Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea {{in the path}} of the storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, the death <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464. Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm. In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) {{assisted}} the Conseil National de Secours (CNS) in Madagascar with surveying areas affected by Hudah. The UNDMT also appealed for relief materials {{for at least}} 50,000–100,000people. Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and medical aid. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with packages of other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha. Although initial reports indicated that 24people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> Madagascar to 111.|$|E

Minfilia reunites with her adoptive mother F'lhaminn, which resolves her remaining doubts about moving away from the Waking Sands in Thanalan. No sooner are they settled when word arrives that a renegade moogle faction has summoned their primal Good King Moggle Mog XII, enabled by the Ascians. After besting the giant moogle, the Warrior of Light encounters a white-robed Ascian named Elidibus who tests the player's might before disappearing. Shortly thereafter, refugees arrive from Doma, a city subjugated by the Garlean Empire, and seek asylum in Ul'dah, which refuses their request.

5|$|Hurricane Alberto damaged a {{total of}} 8,745houses in the country. In Pinar del Río Province, 71homes were destroyed, and across the nation {{hundreds}} of people were left homeless. 83buildings were collapsed {{in the capital city}} of Havana, while sixfactories in Havana Province received damage. The passage of Alberto left several districts in Havana without electricity, telegraph, telephone, and mail service. The Cuban military was deployed to rescue those trapped in flooded homes and also to remove fallen trees. Agricultural damage included about 250,000downed banana trees and 400drowned cattle. Heavy rainfall continued for weeks after the passage of Alberto, resulting in severe damage to the tobacco crop. Subsequent winds and rains destroyed storage sheds which ruined 1.8millionlb. (900,000kg) of the recently finished harvest; 2.6millionlb. (1.3millionkg) of tobacco leaves were also damaged. Two days after its closest approach, the death <b>toll</b> <b>in</b> Cuba reached 11, and a day later it was raised to 23fatalities. The final death toll was reported as either 23 or 24, with one report indicating 17people missing; Pinar del Río Province reported at least 20deaths and Havana reported three casualties. Damage was estimated at $85million (1982USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the <b>toll.</b> <b>In</b> late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E
