25|$|Submarine {{landslides}} are turbidity {{currents and}} consist of water saturated sediments flowing downslope. An example {{occurred during the}} 1929 Grand Banks earthquake that struck the continental slope {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland. Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, farther and farther downslope, away from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100km/h) submarine landslide or <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.|$|E
25|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{can result}} in internal hydraulic jumps (i.e., hydraulic jumps as internal waves in fluids of different density) in abyssal fan formation. The internal hydraulic jumps {{have been associated with}} salinity or temperature induced stratification as well as with density differences due to suspended materials. When the slope of the bed (over which the <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> flows) flattens, the slower rate of flow is mirrored by increased sediment deposition below the flow, producing a gradual backward slope. Where a hydraulic jump occurs, the signature is an abrupt backward slope, corresponding to the rapid reduction in the flow rate at the point of the jump.|$|E
25|$|Black Mountain Sandstone is {{deposited}} {{on top of}} State Circle Shale conformably. It is made up from thick beds of grey quartz sandstone mostly, but has some beds included of siltstone and grey shale. The grain size is fine to medium. It was originally named by Öpik after the mountain—Black Mountain where it is found. Originally it {{was believed to be}} Ordovician, but is actually from the Silurian period, late Llandoverian epoch. Some of the slopes of Black mountain are covered in fanglomerate. The deposition was in a marine proximal turbidite fan, with the <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> flowing to the east. There are no fossils, but there is some sedimentary structure including plane, cross or convolute laminations, load casts, slump units and flute moulds.|$|E
40|$|Small intraslope basins (~ 100 km^ 2), or "minibasins," such {{as those}} found on the {{continental}} slope of the Gulf of Mexico, have been filled predominantly by <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> Each minibasin {{is the result of}} local subsidence and is partially or completely isolated from neighboring basins by ridges formed from compensational uplift. We undertook a series of experiments to investigate the relationship between the flow dynamics of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> entering a minibasin and the stratal architecture of their deposits. The experiments were performed using continuous-feed <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> and surge-feed <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> A dimensionless ponding number is developed to compare the geometry of the deposits with the dynamics of the flows that filled the basins. The experimental surging <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> created a deposit that was notably more ponded than the deposits of continuous <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, the {{performance}} of the extended shallow water model (ESWM) in evaluation of the flow regime of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> entering the Dez Reservoir was investigated. The continuity equations for fluid and particles and the Navier-Stokes equations govern the entire flow of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> The shallow water equations governing the flow of the depositing phase of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> are derived from these equations. A case study was conducted on the flow regime of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> entering the Dez Reservoir in Iran from January 2002 to July 2003. Facing a serious sedimentation problem, the dead storage of the Dez Reservoir will be full in the coming 10 years, and the inflowing water in the hydropower conduit system is now becoming turbid. Based on the values of the dimensionless friction number (Nf ≪ 1) and dimensionless entrainment number (NE ≪ 1) of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents,</b> and the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted deposit depths (R 2 = 0. 86) for the flow regime of negligible friction and negligible entrainment (NFNE), the flow regime of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> coming into the Dez Reservoir is considered to be NFNE. The results suggest that the ESWM is an appropriate approach for evaluation of the flow regime of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> in dam reservoirs where the characteristics of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents,</b> such as the deposit depth, must be evaluated...|$|R

25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current working the sea bottom is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> is called a turbidite.|$|E
5000|$|Low-density <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> {{deposits}} (turbidites) {{are characterized}} by a succession of sedimentary structures {{referred to as the}} Bouma sequence, which result from decreasing energy within the flow (i.e., waning flow), as the <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> moves downslope.|$|E

40|$|Meandering {{channels}} {{formed by}} geophysical flows (e. g. rivers and seafloor <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents)</b> include {{the most extensive}} sediment transport systems on Earth. Previous measurements from rivers show how helical flow at meander bends {{plays a key role}} in sediment transport and deposition. <b>Turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> differ from rivers in both density and velocity profiles. These differences, and the lack of field measurements from <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents,</b> have led to multiple models for their helical flow around bends. Here we present the first measurements of helical flow in submarine <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> These ten flows lasted for 1 -to- 10 days, were up to ~ 80 -metres thick, and displayed a consistent helical structure. This structure comprised two vertically-stacked cells, with the bottom cell rotating with the opposite direction to helical flow in rivers. Furthermore, we propose a general model that predicts the range of helical flow structures observed in rivers, estuaries and <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> based on their density stratification...|$|R
5000|$|Turbidity {{currents}} {{are often}} triggered by tectonic disturbances {{of the sea}} floor. The displacement of continental crust {{in the form of}} fluidization and physical shaking both contribute to their formation. Earthquakes have been linked to <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> deposition in many settings, particularly where physiography favors preservation of the deposits and limits the other sources of <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> deposition. [...] Since the famous case of breakage of submarine cables by a <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> following the 1929 Grand Banks earthquake, earthquake triggered turbidites have been investigated and verified along the Cascadia subduction Zone, the Northern San Andreas Fault, a number of European, Chilean and North American lakes, Japanese lacustrine and offshore regions {{and a variety of other}} settings.|$|E

50|$|When {{the energy}} of a <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> lowers, its ability to keep {{suspended}} sediment decreases, thus sediment deposition occurs. These deposits are called turbidites. Turbidity currents are rarely seen in nature, thus turbidites {{can be used to}} determine <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> characteristics. Some examples: grain size can give indication of current velocity, grain lithology and the use of foraminifera for determining origins, grain distribution shows flow dynamics over time and sediment thickness indicates sediment load and longevity.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} at the outset, the term “hyperpycnite” was introduced by Mulder et al. (2002) in an academic debate with me (Shanmugam 2002) {{on the origin of}} inverse grading by hyperpycnal flows. Mulder et al. (2002) attempted to differentiate “hyperpycnites” deposited by hyperpycnal <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> from “classic turbidites” deposited from failure-related <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> The problem is that triggering mechanisms of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> (or any other process) cannot be determined from the depositional record (Shanmugam 2015, 2016 a, 2016 b, 2016 c).|$|R
50|$|The Lowe {{sequence}} {{describes a}} set of sedimentary structures in turbidite sandstone beds that are deposited by high-density <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> It is intended to complement, not replace, the better known Bouma sequence, which applies primarily to turbidites deposited by low-density (i.e., low-sand concentration) <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
30|$|Generally, in {{addition}} to gas-hydrate destabilization, earthquakes, and tsunamis, <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> that deposit turbidites are triggered by events such as storms and hyperpycnal flows in coastal areas (e.g., Goldfinger et al. 2012; Polonia et al. 2013). Based on the submarine topography mentioned earlier, MST is difficult {{to be affected by}} shallow water areas in terms of the sediment supply. Besides, the compositions of the turbidites within the two cores suggest that the origins of the <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> are below the CCD, suggesting that the main source of the <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> is a scarp in the middle slope. In addition, no gas hydrates have been reported in this area. For these reasons, earthquakes that result in ground motion are the most-likely trigger of the <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> is most {{typically}} {{an underwater}} current of usually rapidly moving, sediment-laden water moving down a slope. Turbidity currents can also occur in other fluids besides water. In the most typical case of oceanic turbidity currents, sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill {{because they have}} a higher density than the adjacent waters. The driving force behind a <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid. These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water. As such currents flow, they often have a [...] "snow-balling-effect", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current. Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded. Once an oceanic <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water column. The sedimentary deposit of a <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> is called a turbidite.|$|E

30|$|Avoid equating hyperpycnal lows with <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b>|$|R
30|$|Importantly, not all density flows are <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> For example, {{although}} both debris flows and <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> {{are considered to}} be density flows, each one can be distinguished from the other by fluid rheology and flow turbulence (Dott 1963; Sanders 1965). Such a distinction is not considered in defining hyperpycnal flows. Hyperpycnal flows are defined {{solely on the basis of}} fluid density. Therefore, it is misleading to equate <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> with hyperpycnal flows (Kostic et al. 2002; Lamb et al. 2010; Steel et al. 2016; Zavala and Arcuri 2016).|$|R

50|$|<b>Turbidity</b> <b>current</b> - Grains are {{suspended}} by fluid turbulence within the flow. Because {{the behavior of}} turbidity currents is largely predictable, they exhibit newtonian behavior, in contrast to flows with cohesive strength (i.e., mudlfows and debris flows). The behavior of turbidity currents in subaqueous settings is strongly influenced by the concentration of the flow, as closely packed grains in high-concentration flows {{are more likely to}} undergo grain-to-grain collisions and generate dispersive pressures as a contributing sediment support mechanism, thereby keep additional grains in suspension. Thus, it is useful to distinguish between low-density and high-density turbidity currents. A powder snow avalanche is essentially a <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> in which air is the supporting fluid and suspends snow granules in place of sand grains.|$|E
50|$|Turbidites are {{commonly}} used {{in the understanding of}} past <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents,</b> for example, the Peru-Chile Trench off Southern Central Chile (36°S-39°S) contains numerous turbidite layers that were cored and analysed. From these turbidites the predicted history of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> in this area was determined, increasing the overall understanding of these currents.|$|R

30|$|Three {{different}} types of sandstone were identified in the study area. The massive sandstone (facies C) and the sandstone containing muddy clasts and “mud coatings” (facies B) are the products of sandy debris flows. Facies D and facies E, which display traction structures and normal grading, represent deposition by <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents.</b> These deposits are thin, which indicates that {{the energy of the}} <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> was low. Therefore, the deposits are interpreted as being the products of subsidiary <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> generated by sandy debris flows.

5000|$|The extreme {{complexity}} of most turbidite systems and beds has promoted {{the development of}} quantitative models of <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> behaviour inferred solely from their deposits. Small-scale laboratory experiments therefore offer {{one of the best}} means of studying their dynamics. Mathematical models can also provide significant insights into current dynamics. In the long term numerical techniques are most likely the best hope of understanding and predicting three-dimensional <b>turbidity</b> <b>current</b> processes and deposits. In most cases there are more variables than governing equations and the models rely upon simplifying assumptions in order to achieve a result. The accuracy of the individual models thus depends upon the validity and choice of the assumptions made. Experimental results provide a means of constraining some of these variables as well as providing a test for such models. [...] Physical data from field observations, or more practical from experiments, are still required in order to test the simplifying assumptions necessary in mathematical models. Most of what is known about large natural turbidity currents (i.e. those significant in terms of sediment transfer to the deep sea) is inferred from indirect sources, such as submarine cable breaks and heights of deposits above submarine valley floors.

30|$|The total {{thickness}} of the turbidite sandstones is small, {{and most of the}} single-event sand bodies of this type are less than 1  m thick (Fig.  9, brown bars), which suggests that the scale of <b>turbidity</b> <b>currents</b> in the study area was small.
