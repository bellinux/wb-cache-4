5|$|Parsnip {{leaves are}} {{sometimes}} <b>tunnelled</b> by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages {{can be seen}} between {{the upper and lower}} surfaces of the leaves. The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means.|$|E
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows <b>tunnelled</b> into {{vertical}} sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, it appears to be considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily loaded. The proposed 2-mile <b>tunnelled</b> extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E

5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} <b>tunnelled</b> from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|Development work on {{the castle}} continued. There was {{extensive}} restoration of the medieval masonry in 1921, with architect John Grant rebuilding the South Gate and the barbican tower, and reconstructing the medieval West Gate and town wall alongside the castle, with the Swiss Bridge being moved in 1927 {{to make room for}} the new West Gate development. Further archaeological investigations were carried out into the Roman walls in 1922 and 1923, leading to Grant redesigning the northern Roman gatehouse. The second half of the castle stables were finally completed. The Animal Wall was moved in the 1920s to the west side of the castle to enclose a pre-Raphaelite themed garden. The grand staircase in the main range was torn out in the 1930s. During World War II, extensive air-raid shelters were <b>tunnelled</b> out within the medieval walls, with eight different sections, able to hold up to 1,800 people in total, and the castle was also used to tether barrage balloons above the city.|$|E
5|$|Tunbridge Wells West {{station was}} opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1866 as the {{terminus}} of its competing line to Tunbridge Wells, but closed in 1985 {{along with that}} line. The station building—a Grade II listed building—is now a restaurant, and a Sainsbury's supermarket occupies the former goods yard. In 1996, however, part of the line was reopened by the Tunbridge Wells and Eridge Railway Preservation Society, which now—as the Spa Valley Railway—operates a steam heritage railway that runs from Tunbridge Wells West to Eridge via High Rocks and Groombridge. The western end of the service was extended from Groombridge to Eridge, on the London-Uckfield line of Southern Railway, on 25 March 2011, serving a platform at Eridge which had been disused for many years. The <b>tunnelled</b> link line between the West and erstwhile Central stations, opened in 1876, remains closed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Applied FLUENT {{simulation}} software {{to research the}} influence of <b>tunnel</b> length, <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity, <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter and <b>tunnel</b> buried depth four important factors on the <b>tunnel</b> wind cooling system in Shenyang area. The results show that, {{with the increase of}} <b>tunnel</b> length and <b>tunnel</b> buried depth and with the decrease of <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity and <b>tunnel</b> equivalent diameter, the outdoor air which passed into the <b>tunnel</b> cooling amplitude increases. For the <b>tunnel</b> wind cooling system optimization design in Shenyang area and the surrounding areas, the advices are that <b>tunnel</b> buried depth should not be more than 6 m and <b>tunnel</b> entrance velocity should not be more than 5 m/s...|$|R
5|$|The works {{had its own}} {{internal}} standard gauge railway for over 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel locomotives {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was <b>tunnelled</b> beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the tomb of Shebitku (Ku. 18) resembles that of Piye (Ku. 17) while that of Shabaka (Ku. 15) {{is similar to that}} of Taharqa (Nu. 1) and Tantamani (Ku. 16). This also favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession in the 25th dynasty. One of the strongest evidence that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku was demonstrated by the architectural features of the Kushite royal pyramids in El Kurru. Only in the pyramids of Piye (Ku 17) and Shebitku (Ku 18) are the burial-chambers open-cut structures with a corbelled roof, whereas fully <b>tunnelled</b> burial chamber substructures are found in the pyramids of Shabaka (Ku 15), Taharqa (Nu 1) and Tantamani (Ku 16), as well as with all subsequent royal pyramids in El Kurru and Nuri. The fully <b>tunnelled</b> and once decorated burial chamber of Shabaka's pyramid was clearly an architectural improvement since it was followed by Taharqa and all his successors. The pyramid design evidence also shows that Shabaka must have ruled after—and not before—Shebitku.|$|E

25|$|When {{the line}} was built, the {{platforms}} at the Bank (then known as City) were located a considerable distance from the surface exits, and a long sloping tunnel had to be negotiated on foot. This led to constant complaints and from 1929 there were many proposals to improve the arrangements, as passenger numbers increased, adding congestion to the physical exertion. The proposals had variously included new escalators, direct connection to adjacent Central London Railway (later Central line) platforms, and new, closer, <b>tunnelled</b> exits.|$|E
25|$|Aqueducts moved {{water through}} gravity alone, being {{constructed}} along a slight downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick or concrete. Most were buried beneath the ground, and followed its contours; obstructing peaks were circumvented or, less often, <b>tunnelled</b> through. Where valleys or lowlands intervened, the conduit was carried on bridgework, or its contents fed into high-pressure lead, ceramic or stone pipes and siphoned across. Most aqueduct systems included sedimentation tanks, sluices and distribution tanks {{to regulate the}} supply at need.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{when the}} Boston subway was {{originally}} built, the subway label was only used for sections into which streetcars (trams) operated, and the rapid transit sections were called tunnels.
