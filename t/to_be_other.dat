The Klan members soon realize it is a set-up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrate on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest, who exhibits a nervous demeanor which the agents believe might yield a confession. The FBI pick him up and interrogate him. Later, Cowens is at home when his window is shattered by a shotgun blast. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, Cowens tries to flee in his truck, but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The FBI arrive to rescue him, having staged the whole scenario; the hooded men are revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Other</b> significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

Data were collected with structured and validated questionnaire, and analyzed using the ordered probit analysis procedure. Participation decisions revealed that marketing experience, farm size, membership of cooperatives/social organizations, extension contact, farming experience and road conditions to the nearest town had positive relationship with decision <b>to</b> <b>be</b> autarkic <b>other</b> than buyer and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seller <b>other</b> than autarkic, and were significant at 1 % level of probability. The coefficient of age, household size, and output were also positive and significantly related <b>to</b> decision <b>to</b> <b>be</b> autarkic <b>other</b> than buyer and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seller <b>other</b> than autarkic at 5 % level of probability. The coefficients for access to credit, and access <b>to</b> communication facilities <b>were</b> positive and significantly relate to decision to remain autarkic other than buyer and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seller <b>other</b> than autarkic. The coefficients for level of education, distance to the nearest town, distance from the farm to the market and cost of transportation were negative and significantly related with the decision to remain autarkic other than a seller and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buyer <b>other</b> autarkic at 1 % level of probability. The coefficient for sex was positive and significantly related to decision by female farmers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> autarkic <b>other</b> than buyer and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seller <b>other</b> than autarkic.

However, mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data suggests that the white wagtail is itself polyphyletic or paraphyletic (i.e. the species is not itself a single coherent grouping). Other phylogenetic studies using mtDNA still {{suggest that there is}} considerable gene flow within the races and the resulting closeness makes Motacilla alba a single species. Some studies have suggested the existence of only two groups : the alboides group, with M. a. alboides, M. a. leucopsis and M. a. personata; and the alba group, with M. a. alba, M. a. yarrellii, M. a. baicalensis, M. a. ocularis, M. a. lugens, and M. a. subpersonata.|$|E

500|$|If Wade's Causeway is {{conclusively}} determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> than a Roman road, {{it would}} not be the only example of long-standing misattribution of ancient structures as Roman roads. The most famous example is the Blackstone Edge Long Causeway, which was once acclaimed as one of the finest surviving Roman roads in Britain, and a structure around which there was [...] "no doubt that..... is Roman". It was accepted as Roman by archaeologists Hayes and Rutter, who also identified Wade's Causeway as Roman. Archaeologist James Maxim in 1965—a year after Hayes and Rutter published their findings on Wade's Causeway—stated that he had found a medieval pack-horse trail passing under Blackstone Edge, which it must therefore post-date. Subsequent research by the archaeological unit of the University of Manchester claimed that the Blackstone Edge road was most probably a turnpike dating from around 1735.|$|E
500|$|The Hunting Party is a {{departure}} from the electronic rock sound of the band's previous two studio albums, A Thousand Suns (2010) and Living Things (2012). The album, described by Shinoda as simply [...] "a rock record", serves a statement by the band against contemporary mainstream and active rock bands, accused by him as [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> bands and playing it safe". Packaged by an artwork by Brandon Parvini based on an original drawing by James Jean, the album took under a year to record and produce, with material being improvisationally written by the band. The album also features guest appearances from Page Hamilton of Helmet, Daron Malakian of System of a Down, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, and Rakim, marking the first time Linkin Park has collaborated with other artists on a studio album.|$|E

500|$|He {{had known}} {{producer}} D.C. Fontana for several years, and pitched his story directly to her. In turn, she relayed {{it to the}} franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, who called Schmerer back for a meeting. Together they re-wrote the story during the meeting to make it fit within the 30-minute-long animated episode. Schmerer explained that Roddenberry appreciated {{the idea of an}} alien pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> characters, and that the animated series could easily show the shapeshifter undergo the various changes in the episode. The design of the Vendorian had been described by Schmerer in the script, but was changed to the squid-like design by the animators, a change that Schmerer described as [...] "neat" [...] and [...] "clever". In the original outline, the Vendorian didn't assume the role of Kirk. Added by Roddenberry, Schmerer did not agree with the change. Roddenberry and Schemerer argued about the point, with Roddenberry saying that Kirk was the star of the series while Schmerer wanted it to be different as he was concerned that its plot would appear too similar to the events of [...] "" [...] where Garth of Izar changes his appearance to become Kirk.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
500|$|In {{a lengthy}} article about Vazaleen in Toronto Life, critic R. M. Vaughan wrote, [...] "In its lewd, spontaneous, hysterical and glamorous way, Vazaleen defined a new Toronto aesthetic, a playful and {{endlessly}} inventive mode of presentation that encompassed everything from lesbian prog- rock to tranny camp to vintage punk revival to good old-fashioned loud-mouthed drag." [...] In {{an editorial in}} C magazine, Amish Morrell wrote, [...] "At [...] {{it was not only}} okay to be gay, but it was okay <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>other</b> than gay. One could be just about anything. The effect was that it completely destabilized all preconceptions of gender and sexual identity, in a hyperlibidinous environment where everyone became a performer." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now wrote, [...] "These days it’s normal in Toronto for hip gay scenes to flourish outside of the queer ghetto and to attract a wide spectrum of genders and orientations, but that didn’t really happen until Vazaleen took off and became a veritable community for everyone who didn’t fit into the mainstream homo world. For too long, it was too rare to see dykes, fags, trans people, and breeders hanging out together, and Munro changed that." [...] Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy. Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, and The Gossip. At the height of the event's popularity, Munro appeared on the cover of Now magazine (made up to look similar to David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album cover), musical guests included Carole Pope, Tracy + the Plastics, Vaginal Davis, Glen Meadmore and Nina Hagen, and Vazaleen appeared on [...] "best-of" [...] nightclub lists internationally.|$|E
