25|$|There {{are many}} options for rotor mounting. IS is a six-bolt mount {{and is the}} {{industry}} standard. Centerlock is patented by Shimano and uses a splined interface along with a lockring to secure the disc. The advantages of centerlock are that the splined interface is theoretically stiffer, and removing the disc is quicker because it only requires one lockring to be removed. Some of the disadvantages are that the design is patented requiring a licensing fee from Shimano. A Shimano cassette lockring tool (or an external BB tool in case of through-axle hub) is needed to remove the rotor and is more expensive and less common than a <b>Torx</b> <b>key.</b> Advantages of IS six-bolt are {{that there are more}} choices when it comes to hubs and rotors.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the design, a flat-blade screwdriver, a cross-blade screwdriver, hex key, <b>Torx</b> <b>key,</b> {{or other}} tool may be {{required}} to properly tighten the connection for reliable operation.|$|E

5000|$|The TRG M10 has a side-folding {{and fully}} {{adjustable}} buttstock, ambidextrous controls, a manual safety that is located inside the trigger guard {{which is in}} front of the trigger, and uniquely designed tactical indicators which helps identify different modular components for different calibers, where every caliber-depending component is specially marked so users can recognize the caliber of each part visually or by touch. For example, for the [...]308 Winchester barrel and bolt are marked with single annual grove, whereas for the [...]300 Winchester Magnum are marked with two groves and three for the [...]338 Lapua Magnum. Another unique feature of the rifle is that all of the tools that are necessary to change the caliber are built into each of the bolt handle; the small <b>torx</b> <b>key</b> is built {{into the center of the}} bolt knob and the barrel wrench is integrated into the base of the bolt handle. An additional set of torx keys are stored inside a small detachable polymer forend, which are necessary for full disassembly of the gun.|$|E
40|$|In {{determining}} the mechanical properties of biological tissues, accurate measurements of such geometrical attributes as cross-sectional area, volume and shape are needed. For soft tissues a non-contact technique is advantageous in {{determining the}}se. A low cost, image-based, non-contact solution has been developed, suitable {{for determining the}} cross-sectional profiles of soft tissues with quasi-prismatic shapes such as tendons and ligaments. Digital processing of images of the object, illuminated by a sheet of laser light, is used to obtain cross-sectional 'slices' through it. The method was validated by using it to measure several rigid reference objects: two circular cylinders, a hex key and <b>torx</b> <b>key,</b> whose shape and dimensions had also been obtained by independent metrology. The smooth circular cross-sectional shape of the cylinder, the flat parallel faces of the hex key and the concave faces of the <b>torx</b> <b>key</b> were all reproduced by the laser-slice method. Their linear dimensions were correctly resolved to within 0. 15 mm or less, and cross-sectional areas to within 0. 17 mm 2 or less. The method has been applied successfully to a selection of bovine digital extensor tendons. Some contained concavities on their surfaces, and their cross-sectional areas ranged from 14 mm 2 to 49 mm 2. The new method provides an accuracy and resolution better than or comparable to previous non-contact approaches, while avoiding some of their disadvantages. Â© 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E
