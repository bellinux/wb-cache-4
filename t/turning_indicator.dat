40|$|The {{effects of}} a driver {{assistance}} system for keeping safe speed and safe distance (referred to as SASPENCE) on driver behaviour, reactions and acceptance were evaluated in a test carried out in 2006. Twenty test drivers, recruited by ads, drove two times (once with the system off and once with the system on) in real traffic conditions along a 50 km long test route containing urban and rural roads and motorway sections outside Turin, Italy. Driving data was logged and the test drivers were observed {{by means of an}} in-car observation method, in this case by two observers riding along in the car with the driver. Driver opinions were collected through questionnaires. The findings show positive effects of the system in terms of fewer alarm situations, shorter alarm lengths, shorter reaction times, increased headway and better interactions with vulnerable road users at intersections. On the negative side, driver performance worsened slightly, the number of centre line crossings increased, there was worse facilitating behaviour with regard to other drivers and harder braking at traffic lights. No major effect on speed behaviour of the driver, lane choice, lane keeping, lane change, overtaking, red running, use of <b>turning</b> <b>indicator</b> and workload was found.

40|$|An {{observational}} study, {{focusing on}} motorcyclists, was conducted between June and August 2012 at access points on straight road sections of primary roads in Malaysia. This {{was done in}} order to gain more insight into the actual road traffic situation at these sites. The majority of the motorcyclists kept to the speed limit and lowered speed when approaching an access point, especially when road users were on it. However, when the primary road traffic volume was high, they maintained higher speeds compared to other vehicles. The behavioral observations revealed a risky right turning movement, i. e. Opposite Indirect Right Turn (OIRT), from the access point into the primary road. Motorcyclists generally had a high compliance rate of helmet (except for female motorcyclists) and headlight usage. Motorcyclists attempting to enter the primary road were poor at utilizing the <b>turning</b> <b>indicator.</b> They were observed not to turn their heads to look for vehicles when entering a road with a low volume of traffic, compared to entering a road with a high volume of traffic. Most of the motorcyclists did not comply with the stop line rule, especially those who made the OIRT. Motorcyclists entering from the access point are involved in serious traffic conflicts to about the same extent as other vehicles. Moreover, motorcyclists who stopped at the stop line and made a right turn into the primary road by accepting a short gap, resulting in a time lag of less than 4 s, were involved in the majority of the serious conflicts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBehavior {{of right}} turning {{vehicles}} {{in the context of}} safety is characterized by their use of turning indicators and compliance with the stop rule. They are influence by the width of the carriageway and the variation in volume on the major road with respect to the traffic moving in the near and far side direction. Other factors affecting the behavior are the speed and spacing between vehicles moving on the major road. Lack of adequate past knowledge on the effect of geometric variation in terms of road width and directional variation in volume on the safety of unsignalized intersections have provided the motivation for this study. This paper focuses on the many factors that affect the behavior of right-turning vehicles resulting into conflicts. A brief account of the unique indigenous maneuver termed as the “Weaving Merging Right Turn” (WMRT) is provided and its effectiveness with respect to conventional right turn is evaluated. Data of 39, 016 vehicles collected on 10 sites between January and June 2014 was analyzed. Multiple accidents were observed only on sites which had near side traffic volume greater than far side traffic volume. This result remains consistent with sites having single as well as multiple lanes per direction on the major roads. The number of conflicts for vehicles performing the WMRT was 2. 5 times less as compared to the conventional right turn. Moreover WMRT was found to be the maneuver of choice for right turning motorcyclists with 60 % of them opting for it over the conventional right turn on intersections having major road width less than 9 m. None of the motorcyclists, which were involved in a traffic conflict, were observed to use their <b>turning</b> <b>indicator.</b> Moreover none of the motorcyclists, which experienced a traffic conflict, were found to comply with the stopping rule at sites with major road width less than 9 m. On sites with major road width greater than 9 m, 45 % of motorcyclists, involved in a traffic conflict, complied with the stopping rule as compared to 79 % by vehicles other than motorcycles...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This article {{describes}} one experiment that studied {{the influence of}} Daytime Running Lamps (DRL) on pedestrian detection of <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b> Method: An experimental device including one DRL and one <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> was used {{in order to determine}} Visual Reaction Times (VRT) of 148 observers in different situations involving <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> activation. Such situations were combinations of three main variables: color of DRL, separation between DRL and <b>Turn</b> <b>Indicator,</b> and observation angle. Results: Significant changes in VRT were found depending on the configurations above, especially the observation angle and the color of DRL. This second result demonstrates that amber DRLs inhibit the detection of <b>Turn</b> <b>Indicators.</b> Impact on industry: One of the main targets {{of this paper is to}} recommend that carmakers introduce only white DRLs on new vehicles. We also intend to advise regulatory bodies working on automotive regulation about the consequences of allowing amber DRLs and also about the danger of introducing constrains on the distance between DRL and <b>Turn</b> <b>Indicator</b> without further experimental evidences...|$|R
