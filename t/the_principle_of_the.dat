5|$|The {{development}} of infinitesimal calculus {{was at the}} forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour (in particular his reliance on <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liberum veto {{preserved}} the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened {{the role of}} the monarchy, led to anarchy in political life, and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{has adopted}} <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{separation}} of powers. In line with this principle, judicial power is exercised by independent courts {{on behalf of}} the Turkish nation. The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors, the profession of judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the Turkish Constitution.|$|E

This paper examines the conceptual problems involved in specifying <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHS, and the em-pirical problems associated with detecting breaks in these <b>principles.</b> First, <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHS are explored. Second, the period between 1948 and 1979 is reviewed {{to see if any}} principles were compromised before <b>the</b> term <b>of</b> office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current government and, third, the period since 1979 is examined to see how <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> have fared. It concludes that <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service have come under greater strain since 1979, and fractures have become more obvious...|$|R

5|$|In England, Legal Deposit can {{be traced}} back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.|$|E
5|$|In England, Parliament held James {{abandoned}} the throne by fleeing from English territory to France. The Convention argued James forfeited the Scottish throne by his actions, as {{listed in the}} Articles of Grievances. This effectively rejected <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divine Right of Kings which had driven political conflict for the last 60 years. If James could {{be removed from the}} throne because of his acts, monarchs derived their legitimacy not from God but the people as represented by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This was based on <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National curriculum Statement (NCS) for Life Orientation has various requirements. Thus, with {{a specific}} focus on Life Orientation in grade 10, the study aimed at investigating various issues around <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> these <b>principles.</b> To this end, a mixed-methods approach was used. In the quantitative phase, questionnaires were used. In the qualitative phase, focus groups and interviews were used to collect data. Similar questions were asked in both phases. The sample {{was a group of}} 48 Life Orientation teachers from 48 secondary schools in the Gauteng West district. Ethical issues were considered. Techniques to ensure validity and reliability were also taken into account. The results showed that, in general: • <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS in Life Orientation had resulted in too much paperwork and administration for <b>the</b> teachers; • <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS had not helped to transform education from the apartheid era system <b>of</b> education to <b>the</b> present democratic system <b>of</b> education; • <b>the</b> teachers were poorly trained with regard to implementing <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS in the sense that there were not enough workshops and follow-up support provided; • <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS were not implemented at schools, among others because there were problems with <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> policies to <b>the</b> teachers via the school management; • <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS did not make the envisaged impact on learner attitudes since <b>the</b> attitudes <b>of</b> many learners were often negative; • <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS did not make the envisaged impact on learner respect for other cultures; • <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS did not have the ideal impact on morals, values and standards; or impact significantly on crime rate, learner pregnancy or disrespect at school; and• <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS did not support learners well to acquire life skills. • However, <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NCS in Life Orientation were more successful with regards to helping address barriers to learning.

5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that {{it would be difficult for}} him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
