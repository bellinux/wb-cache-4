5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine <b>to</b> <b>also</b> explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
5|$|A {{photograph}} from Leon's {{apartment and}} the snake scale lead Deckard to {{a strip club}} where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him <b>to</b> <b>also</b> retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks Deckard's pistol from his hand and then begins to kill Deckard, but Rachael uses Deckard's pistol to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment, and, during an intimate discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.|$|E

5|$|After {{success with}} {{shooting}} down alien scout ships and securing the crash sites from surviving alien crews, {{as well as}} interdicting alien attempts to abduct human civilians for unknown purposes, XCOM manages <b>to</b> <b>also</b> obtain the corpses of various different alien troops. Autopsies reveal that all these types have been genetically and/or cybernetically altered, which seems to indicate they are merely foot-soldiers for unseen leaders. XCOM's head of research, Dr. Vahlen, requests that a live alien be captured for interrogation. This also involves developing a specialized weapon capable of capturing a live alien, and constructing a facility in XCOM's subterranean base capable of safely holding a live alien prisoner.|$|E
5|$|At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, the Brazilian {{started by}} winning a {{gold in the}} 50-metre butterfly, beating the {{championship}} record. He hoped <b>to</b> <b>also</b> win gold in the 50-metre and 100-metre freestyle, but settled for silver in the 50-metre freestyle, and bronze in the 100-metre freestyle. When interviewed after the contest, Cielo said {{there could have been}} some flaw in his training program, resulting in a lack of stamina.|$|E
5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands <b>to</b> <b>also</b> facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E

5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man forgery. It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely <b>to</b> <b>also</b> be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995 with Oblivion at Alton Towers {{opening on}} March 14, 1998, {{making it the}} world's first Dive Coaster. The trains {{for this type of}} coaster are {{relatively}} short consisting of two to three cars. Bolliger & Mabillard have recently begun <b>to</b> <b>also</b> use floorless trains on this model to enhance the experience. As of May 2016, ten Dive Coasters have been built, with the newest being Valravn at Cedar Point.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin <b>to</b> <b>also</b> exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010 NBA offseason, LeBron James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas left Cleveland for the Miami Heat, {{which led}} several other {{veterans}} <b>to</b> <b>also</b> leave the team.

While Cleveland only managed a conference-worst 19–63 season, {{they were able to}} upset LeBron James' heavily favored Miami Heat on March 29, 2011 in a game where Parker grabbed eight rebounds and scored 20 points.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht's wife's name is unknown. A {{fifteenth century}} chronicle now held by Oxford University names Ecgberht's wife as Redburga who was {{supposedly}} a relation of Charlemagne that he married {{when he was}} banished to Francia, but this is dismissed by academic historians in view of its late date. He is reputed {{to have had a}} half-sister Alburga, later to be recognised as a saint for her founding of Wilton Abbey. She was married to Wulfstan, ealdorman of Wiltshire, and on his death in 802 she became a nun, Abbess of Wilton Abbey.

5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War, {{during which}} many U.S. Apaches {{operated}} from bases within Saudi territory, Saudi Arabia purchased twelve AH-64As for the Royal Saudi Land Force. It {{has been speculated}} that the Saudi purchase had motivated Israel <b>to</b> <b>also</b> procure the Apaches. In August 2006, the Saudi Arabian government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $400M, possibly remanufacturing their AH-64As to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. In September 2008, the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH-64Ds requested by Saudi Arabia. In October 2010, Saudi Arabia requested a further 70 AH-64Ds {{as part of a}} possible, massive arms deal.|$|E
5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} {{concession}} {{on the route}} from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The concession allowed SAS <b>to</b> <b>also</b> take passengers on the domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E

5|$|Ibn Tulun {{stands out}} as the first {{governor}} of a major province of the Abbasid Caliphate to not only establish himself as its master independently of the Abbasid court, but <b>to</b> <b>also</b> pass power on to his son. He was thus also the first ruler since the Ptolemaic Pharaohs to make Egypt an independent political power again, with a sphere of influence encompassing Syria {{and parts of the}} Maghreb, setting the tone for later Egypt-based Islamic regimes, from the Ikhshidids to the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, the Grand Master's fleet {{anticipated}} and repelled eight Turkish vessels which {{attempted to}} infiltrate {{the island of}} Gozo.

Headed by the commanding knight of Langon, the fleet managed to sink an admiral ship. In the following year the commanding knight of Langon was defeated at sea after attacking an Algerian admiral vessel. Nevertheless, the Maltese fleet emerged victorious. Between 1713 and 1715, the fleet of the Order patrolled all the coasts around the Mediterranean succeeding in various important undertakings.|$|E
