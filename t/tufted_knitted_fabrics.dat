The performance and appearance of these DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated objectively and subjectively. The testing results demonstrated that the DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> had better abrasion property, worse pilling resistance due to the mechanical property of polyester yarn when compared with 100 % cotton warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric.</b> Meanwhile, lower water vapour permeability and air resistance were found for DS polyester warp <b>knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> resulting from the dense structure of yarn shrinkage after heat-moisture treatment.
