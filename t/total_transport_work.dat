40|$|This {{thesis is}} about animal {{transports}} and {{their effect on}} animal welfare. Transports are needed in today’s system of livestock farming. Long transports are stressful for animals and infectious diseases can spread via animal transports. With optimization methods transport times can be minimized, {{but there is a}} trade-off between short distances for the animals and short distances for the trucks. The risk of disease spread in the transport system and disease occurrence at farms can be studied with models and network analysis. The animal transport data {{and the quality of the}} data in the Swedish national database of cattle and pig transports are investigated in the thesis. The data is analyzed regarding number of transports, number of farms, seasonality, geographical properties, transport distances, network measures of individual farms and network measures of the system. The data can be used as input parameters in epidemic models. Cattle purchase reports are double reported and we found that there are incorrect and missing reports in the database. The quality is improving over the years i. e. 5 % of cattle purchase reports were not correctly double reported in 2006, 3 % in 2007 and 1 % in 2008. In the reports of births and deaths of cattle we detected date preferences; more cattle births and deaths are reported on the 1 st, 10 th and 20 th each month. This is because when we humans don’t remember the exact number we tend to pick nice numbers (like 1, 10 and 20). This implies that the correct date is not always reported. Network analysis and network measures are suggested as tools to estimate risk for disease spread in transport systems and risk of disease introduction to individual holdings. Network generation algorithms can be used together with epidemic models to test the ability of network measures to predict disease risks. I have developed, and improved, a network generation algorithm that generates a large variety of structures. In my thesis I also suggest a method, the good choice heuristic, for generating non-optimal routes. Today coordination of animal transports is neither optimal nor random. In epidemic simulations we need to model routes as close to the actual driven routes as possible and the good choice heuristic can model that. The heuristic is tuned by two parameters and creates coordination of routes from completely random to almost as good as the Clarke and Wright heuristic. I also used the method to make the rough estimate that transport distances for cattle can be reduced by 2 - 24 % with route-coordination optimization of transports-to-slaughter. Different optimization methods can be used to minimize the transport times for animal-transports in Sweden. For transports-to-slaughter the strategic planning of “which animals to send where” is the first step to optimize. I investigated data from 2008 and found that with strategic planning, given the slaughterhouse capacity, transport distances can be decreased by about 25 % for pigs and 40 % for cattle. The slaughterhouse capacity and placement are limiting the possibility to minimize transport times for the animals. The transport distances could be decreased by 60 % if all animals were sent to the closest slaughterhouse 2008. Small-scale and mobile slaughterhouses have small effect on <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> <b>work</b> (total transport distance for all the animals) but are important for the transport distances of the animals that travel the longest...|$|E

40|$|In Part II we {{construct}} new numerical {{solutions to}} further analyze our results in Part I (Burnett et al., 2003), that indicate {{the lack of}} a unique relationship between the Paci c/Indian Ocean pressure difference and the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the IndonesianThrough ow (ITF).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a simplified analytical procedure for determining the optimal timing for upgrading low-volume roads in developing countries. Most roadway upgradings from gravel to surface treated and to asphaltic concrete are carried out when <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> cost on a road becomes high as a result of high traffic and the consequent rapid deterioration of the roadway. Adequate timing of upgrading strategies ensures effective use of resources and lower <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> cost. This study examined existing systems, models, and approaches for estimating <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> cost components. An analytical procedure was then developed using a decision-tree concept to delineate all possible upgrading strategies within a plan period. The decision-tree concept depicts all the possible upgrading strategies within a plan period with decisions on roadway upgrading made at certain decision intervals. The <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> cost of the upgrading strategies is evaluated to establish the optimal strategies and traffic warrants for improving a roadway surface. A computer program PVMNT was written to facilitate the computation of the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> cost. A case study was presented to demonstrate the application of the analytical procedure. The case study revealed interesting results on the changes of optimal upgrading strategies with changes in base traffic volume and growth rate. However, general conclusions could not be drawn {{based on the results of}} the case study. These results, as well as the analytical procedure, should be of interest to engineers responsible for providing low-volume roads in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A high resolution, regional, non-linear, {{barotropic}} 20 øS to liøN and 111 øE to 142 øE. The domain {{is covered}} ocean model (2 D POM) {{was used to}} show that a pressure difference between the Pacific and Indian Ocean does not significantly influence the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the Indonesian throughflow. There is a persistent pressure difference between the Pa-cific and Indian Ocean. Based on a channel flow analogy, Wyrtki [1961, 1987] suggested that this pressure difference is a dominant factor determining the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the Indonesian throughflow. This conclusion was founded on the assumption that, for the channel's overall momentum balance, the pressure head is essentially balanced by the fric-tional forces. This is true if the bottom topography is not taken into account. In the presence of bottom topography the resultant horizontal component of the pressure forces acting on the bottom (the bottom form stress) becomes an important factor. In principle, the bottom form stress can essentially balance the corresponding pressure head which is why the pressure head may not strongly control the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the channel flow. Taking the Indonesian Seas' complicated bottom topography into consideration, we hy-pothesize that the Pacific-Indian Ocean pressure difference may not significantly influence the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the In-donesian throughflow. The purpose of this note is to test the hypothesis using a high-resolution barotropic ocean model centered over the Indonesian Seas area. In such a model we will essentially specify the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the through-flow, Q. We will show, however, that there might exist many steady-state regimes having practically the same Q, but substantially different inter-ocean pressure differences, /kP, implying a rather weak relation between Q and /k...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{competitiveness of}} the six Korea-Europe transport routes. For the criteria of analysis, the quantitative factors (<b>total</b> <b>transport</b> distance, <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> time, and <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> cost) and the qualitative factors (transport service, safety, and awareness) were selected and weighed. The factors were then applied to the TOPSIS technique to rank the routes based on their competitiveness. The result of TOPSIS analysis showed the priority in the routes as follows: Route 1 (Trans Korea Railway(TKR) and Trans Siberia Railway(TSR)) > Route 6 (Arctic Route) >Route 4 (Busan-Vanino-TSR) >Route 2 (Busan-Vostochny-TSR) > Route 3 (Busan-Vladivostok-Vostochny-TSR) > Route 5 (Suez Canal Route). Route 1 was found the most competitive, and Route 5, {{the most widely used}} sea way was ranked the lowest. In addition, the new transport routes, Route 1 and 6 are shown to be more competitive than the currently available routes, Route 2, 3 and 4. However, these routes need national level supports (rail construction for Route 1 and subsidy plan for Route 6) for the commercial use in the future...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the overall balance of momentum and energy within the Indonesian Seas to better understand the factors that control the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the Indonesian Through ow. Two models are used in the investigation: a “ rst-step ” heuristic channel model and a more sophisticated “second-step, ” barotropic numerical model that incorporates high-resolution coastline and bottom topography. The experiments show that the barotropic model develops typical horizontal circulation patterns for the region. An analysis of the overall momentum and energy balances suggests that the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> of the IndonesianThroughow does not depend exclusivelyon the inter-oceanpressure differencebut on other factors, including local winds, botto...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn January/February 2006, a hydrographic section under Jason track 104 across Drake Passage (DP) was {{performed}} twice within 3 weeks, on {{board of the}} R/V Polarstern. Two LADCPs mounted on the CTD rosette provided the most comprehensive synoptic top-to-bottom observations of directly measured velocity available in the Drake Passage to date, with an estimated error of less than 3 cm s - 1. Geostrophic velocities computed from the hydrographic data were referenced to LADCP velocities. The velocity structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) along the track and its evolution within 3 weeks reflect the frontal branches presented by Barré et al. (2011) and Provost et al. (2011). The repeated section offers two independent transport estimates, computed from the LADCP velocities (145 ± 8. 8 and 137. 9 ± 10. 5 Sv, respectively) and from the adjusted geostrophic velocities (136. 6 ± 7 and 129 ± 7 Sv, respectively). Error bars of the transport estimates are small. Contributions of the fronts and eddies to the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> are modified within 3 weeks but tend to compensate each other. The <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> is reduced by about 10 % (15 [...] 17 Sv) between the southward and northward journey. <b>Total</b> <b>transport</b> estimations are compared to previous results, in particular the ISOS (International Southern Ocean Study) data, from which the canonical value of 134 Sv has been estimated.

40|$|The interannual {{variations}} of volume transport {{in the western}} Labrador Sea are estimated using six years of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data and hydrographic data from a WOCE repeat section and a method based on the linear momentum equation in which the sea surface {{is the level of}} known motion. The interannual variation of the <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> in spring/summer has a range of 6. 2 Sv (Sv ≡ 106 m 3 s− 1) and is positively correlated with the fall/winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and wind patterns in the northwest North Atlantic. The <b>total</b> <b>transport</b> anomaly is decomposed into a barotropic and a baroclinic component. The interannual change of the barotropic transport {{is similar to that of}} the <b>total</b> <b>transport,</b> and is positively correlated with the fall/winter NAO index. The baroclinic transport anomaly, in comparison, has a smaller magnitude and the opposite sign. The authors conjecture that the deepened Icelandic low in high index years generates a strong cyclonic wind stress curl, which in turn creates a strong divergence and a large upward sea surface slope toward the Greenland coast, resulting in an intensified Labrador Sea circulation...|$|R
