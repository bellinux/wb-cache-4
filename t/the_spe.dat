25|$|Both the PPE and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE {{contains a}} 64-bit {{general purpose register}} set (GPR), a 64-bit floating point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. <b>The</b> <b>SPE</b> contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used for}} scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System memory addresses for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E

[...] When a securitization takes place, there often is a [...] "true sale" [...] that takes place between the Originator (the parent company) and <b>the</b> <b>SPE.</b> [...] This sale has to be for the market value of the underlying assets for the [...] "true sale" [...] to stick and thus this sale is reflected on the parent company's balance sheet, which will boost earnings for that quarter by the amount of the sale. [...] While not illegal in any respect, this does distort the true earnings of the parent company.|$|E

Terra Soft strategically {{partnered with}} Mercury to provide a Linux Board Support Package for Cell, and support and development of software applications on various other Cell platforms, including the IBM BladeCenter JS21 and Cell QS20, and Mercury Cell-based solutions. Terra Soft also maintains the Y-HPC (High Performance Computing) Cluster Construction and Management Suite and Y-Bio gene sequencing tools. Y-Bio is built upon the RPM Linux standard for package management, and offers tools which help bioinformatics researchers conduct their work with greater efficiency. IBM has developed a pseudo-filesystem for Linux coined [...] "Spufs" [...] that simplifies access to and use of <b>the</b> <b>SPE</b> resources. IBM is currently maintaining a Linux kernel and GDB ports, while Sony maintains the GNU toolchain (GCC, binutils).|$|E
25|$|The kernel and {{scheduling}} is distributed across <b>the</b> <b>SPEs.</b> Tasks are synchronized using mutexes or semaphores as {{in a conventional}} operating system. Ready-to-run tasks wait in a queue for an SPE to execute them. <b>The</b> <b>SPEs</b> use shared memory for all tasks in this configuration.|$|R
2500|$|The PPE, {{which is}} capable of running a {{conventional}} operating system, has control over <b>the</b> <b>SPEs</b> and can start, stop, interrupt, and schedule processes running on <b>the</b> <b>SPEs.</b> To this end the PPE has additional instructions relating to control of <b>the</b> <b>SPEs.</b> Unlike <b>SPEs,</b> <b>the</b> PPE can read and write the main memory and the local memories of <b>SPEs</b> through <b>the</b> standard load/store instructions. [...] Despite having Turing complete architectures, <b>the</b> <b>SPEs</b> are not fully autonomous and require the PPE to prime them before they can do any useful work. As most of the [...] "horsepower" [...] of the system comes from the synergistic processing elements, the use of DMA {{as a method of}} data transfer and the limited local memory footprint of each SPE pose a major challenge to software developers who wish {{to make the most of}} this horsepower, demanding careful hand-tuning of programs to extract maximal performance from this CPU.|$|R
30|$|We {{have also}} parallelized the HD {{calculation}} on the Cell processor on the PlayStation 3. As stated before, SPE management is left {{entirely to the}} programmer. We therefore have completely separate code and compilations for the PPE and <b>the</b> <b>SPEs.</b> <b>The</b> code on the PPE works as a slave master, spawning off threads of work to <b>the</b> 6 individual <b>SPEs.</b> <b>The</b> work is divided up on iris template matching boundaries, not within a template match. Therefore, each SPE is individually responsible for 1 / 6 th of the HD comparisons. To maximize performance, the HD calculation is vectorized on <b>the</b> <b>SPEs,</b> {{taking advantage of the}} SIMD capabilities of the SPU's.|$|R
2500|$|Each SPE is a dual {{issue in}} order {{processor}} {{composed of a}} [...] "Synergistic Processing Unit", SPU, and a [...] "Memory Flow Controller", MFC (DMA, MMU, and bus interface). SPEs don't have any branch prediction hardware (hence there is a heavy burden on the compiler). Each SPE has 6 execution units divided among odd and even pipelines on each SPE : The SPU runs a specially developed instruction set (ISA) with 128-bit SIMD organization for single and double precision instructions. With {{the current generation of}} the Cell, each SPE contains a 256KiB embedded SRAM for instruction and data, called [...] "Local Storage" [...] (not to be mistaken for [...] "Local Memory" [...] in Sony's documents that refer to the VRAM) which is visible to the PPE and can be addressed directly by software. Each SPE can support up to 4 GiB of local store memory. The local store does not operate like a conventional CPU cache since it is neither transparent to software nor does it contain hardware structures that predict which data to load. The SPEs contain a 128-bit, 128-entry register file and measures 14.5mm2 on a 90nm process. An SPE can operate on sixteen 8-bit integers, eight 16-bit integers, four 32-bit integers, or four single-precision floating-point numbers in a single clock cycle, as well as a memory operation. Note that the SPU cannot directly access system memory; the 64-bit virtual memory addresses formed by the SPU must be passed from the SPU to <b>the</b> <b>SPE</b> memory flow controller (MFC) to set up a DMA operation within the system address space.|$|E

50|$|A {{special-purpose}} entity may {{be owned}} {{by one or more}} other entities and certain jurisdictions may require ownership by certain parties in specific percentages.

For example, {{in the context of a}} loan securitization, if <b>the</b> <b>SPE</b> securitisation vehicle were owned or controlled by the bank whose loans were to be secured, <b>the</b> <b>SPE</b> would be consolidated with the rest of the bank's group for regulatory, accounting, and bankruptcy purposes, which would defeat the point of the securitisation.

Our implementation of Linpack also supports clusters of QS 22 s, and was used to achieve a result of 11. 1 TFLOPS on a cluster of 84 QS 22 blades.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{potential}} performance improvements for catastrophe modelling systems {{that can be}} achieved through parallelization on a Cell Processor (Cell/B.

Our parallel solution is a combination of multiple techniques: streaming data to <b>the</b> <b>SPEs</b> and parallelizing inner loop computations, building caches on <b>the</b> <b>SPEs</b> to store parts of the large catastrophe modelling lookup tables, vectorizing the computation on <b>the</b> <b>SPEs,</b> and double-buffering <b>the</b> file I/O.

50|$|Normally {{a company}} will {{transfer}} assets to <b>the</b> <b>SPE</b> for management or use <b>the</b> <b>SPE</b> {{to finance a}} large project thereby achieving a narrow set of goals without putting the entire firm at risk. SPEs are also commonly used in complex financings to separate different layers of equity infusion. Commonly created and registered in tax havens, SPEs allow tax avoidance strategies unavailable in the home district. Round-tripping is one such strategy. In addition, they are commonly used to own a single asset and associated permits and contract rights (such as an apartment building or a power plant), to allow for easier transfer of that asset. They {{are an integral part}} of public private partnerships common throughout Europe which rely on a project finance type structure.|$|E
50|$|Like a company, an SPE {{must have}} promoter(s) or sponsor(s). Usually, a {{sponsoring}} corporation hives off assets or activities {{from the rest}} of the company into an SPE. This isolation of assets is important for providing comfort to investors. The assets or activities are distanced from the parent company, hence the performance of the new entity will not be affected by the ups and downs of the originating entity. <b>The</b> <b>SPE</b> will be subject to fewer risks and thus provide greater comfort to the lenders. What is important here is the distance between the sponsoring company and <b>the</b> <b>SPE.</b> In the absence of adequate distance between the sponsor and the new entity, the latter will not be an SPE but only a subsidiary company.|$|E
