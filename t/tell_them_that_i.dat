I am not inspired by someone posing {{against the backdrop of}} roses in a vase or pink curtains. What inspires me is a person who has gone hungry for hours and is struggling for survival. The expression that lights his face {{at the end of the}} day when he has finally found some scraps, that is what touches me. I am a painter of the expression of reality." [...] Self-proclaimed [...] "Faqir," [...] Sadequain was outside society's worldly greed or hypocrisy and called himself [...] "speaker of truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 Chris Davies, a Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament for the {{northwest}} of England {{wrote to a}} pro-Israel constituent that she [...] "enjoyed wallowing in her own filth." [...] In a later message to her he complained about Israel's [...] "racist policies of apartheid" [...] and stated [...] "I shall <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> intend {{to speak out against}} this oppression at every opportunity, and I shall denounce the influence of the Jewish lobby that seems to have far too great a say over the political decision-making process in many countries." [...] As a consequence of the outcry raised by the attack on the constituent, Davies resigned soon after as leader of the Liberal Democrats group in the European Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Herbert Gould {{was born}} at home in Toronto on September 25, 1932, to Russell Herbert ("Bert") Gold and Florence ("Flora") Emma Gold (née Greig), Presbyterians of Scottish and English ancestry. His {{maternal}} grandfather was a cousin of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (who was himself of Scottish ancestry). The family's surname was changed to Gould informally around 1939 {{in order to avoid}} being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing anti-Semitism of prewar Toronto and the Gold surname's Jewish association. Gould had no Jewish ancestry, though he sometimes made jokes on the subject, like [...] "When people ask me if I'm Jewish, I always <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was Jewish during the war." [...] Gould grew up in a home at 32 Southwood Drive, Toronto. His childhood home has been named a historic site by the City of Toronto.|$|E

60|$|Upon this {{occasion}} I {{began to take}} upon me a little to hearten them up, and to call upon them to load again, and give <b>them</b> another volley, <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would engage, {{if they would be}} ruled by me, I'd make the negroes run fast enough. I found this heartened them, and therefore, when they fired a second time, I desired them to reserve some of their shot for an attempt by itself, as I mentioned above.|$|R

"Nevertheless, {{go back to}} <b>them,</b> and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> both what I {{have told}} you; and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> this also, <b>that</b> <b>I,</b> Owen Fitzgerald of Hap House, still love her better than all that the world else can give me; indeed, {{there is nothing else}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do love,--except you, Desmond.

60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. [peacefully] Oh, {{very likely}} you will: {{you know what}} she is when she has set her mind on anything. But don't put it on me: <b>that's</b> all <b>I</b> ask. Tavy has just let out that she's been saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am making her marry you; and the poor boy is {{breaking}} his heart about it; for he is in love with her himself, though what he sees in her so wonderful, goodness knows: I don't. It's no use telling Tavy that Ann puts things into people's heads by <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want <b>them</b> when the thought of them never crossed my mind. It only sets Tavy against me. But you know better than that. So if you marry her, don't put the blame on me.|$|R

5000|$|In a December 2011 interview, Daldry {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} making a Kavalier & Clay adaptation as a television miniseries rather than a feature film, preferring to do it [...] "on HBO as an eight-parter...If you could put that in the article and ring up HBO and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>that’s</b> what <b>I</b> wanna do, I’d really appreciate it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Described as a Roman à clef by Caine's modern biographer, {{the novel}} also used many themes and occurrences from Caine's own life. One notable {{instance}} {{of this is}} the episode where Bessie is sent away to be educated before she would be fit to marry the educated and higher-class Victor Stowell, which clearly recalls Caine's having set up Mary Chandler in Sevenoaks in order to be educated before their own marriage. As was usual in Caine's work, he makes no acknowledgement of his main sources, instead writing that [...] "while the principal incidents of the tale I have now to tell owe something to reminiscence, I have exercised so freely the storyteller's licence in <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> ... <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can claim no better authority for my story than that of an independent creation, with a general background of fact." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{band played}} several {{high-profile}} gigs supporting the album, including one on February 27, 1989 {{at what was}} regarded as {{the centre of the}} associated Madchester and baggy scenes, Manchester's The Haçienda nightclub.

[...] The Stone Roses' 1990 Spike Island gig, organised by the band and attended by over 27,000 fans, also holds a formidable reputation. Critics have frequently labelled it the [...] "Woodstock of the baggy generation". Their debut brought them nationwide success and soon the band, along with fellow Madchester group Happy Mondays, were perceived as one of the key acts of the baggy scene.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Our position, I fear, is fatal in this defile,' said Tancred; 'it is bitter to be {{the cause}} of exposing so many brave men to almost {{inevitable}} slaughter. <b>Tell</b> <b>them,</b> Baroni, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not the brother of the Queen of the English; that they are ridiculously misled, and that their aim is hopeless, for all that will be ransomed will be my corpse.' ...|$|R

30|$|I really {{learned to}} not doubt myself so much {{when it comes}} to creativity.
