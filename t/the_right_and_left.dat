5|$|During her {{shows at}} the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{campaigned for}} the {{nomination}} {{for the most part}} of 1987, traveling to numerous state conventions. He visited Pennsylvania in April to discuss the Libertarian Party's platform with students from Penn State. Native American activist, and challenger to Paul, Russell Means of South Dakota also appeared at the event. Means had officially announced his Libertarian presidential nomination candidacy a day before Paul. While Means received heightened media attention for his comments regarding Native Americans and militancy, reports in the news media circulated that highlighted Paul's calls for the nation to return to the Gold Standard, and diminish the power of the Federal Reserve. Paul and Means were described as members of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> wing of the Libertarian Party, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery indicates that the clavicle reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E

5|$|The lower {{respiratory}} tract {{is part of the}} respiratory system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the lungs. The trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place where it splits (the carina) into a right and left bronchus. These supply air to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. These in turn supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases take place. Oxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.|$|E
5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E

5|$|The {{skeleton}} (catalogue number QG24) {{has been}} found weathering out of a hill slope and was partially eroded by surface exponation and plant roots. It includes the pelvis and sacrum, most of the left hind limb and foot, a right thigh bone, and twelve anterior tail vertebrae. These remains pertain to a single individual as they were all found articulated (still connected together). Additionally, several disarticulated bones were found, including the right forearm and some metacarpalia and phalanges from both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> forefeet, probably also pertaining to this individual. Later, the site was revisited by the scientists Geoffrey Bond and Michael Cooper, {{who were able to}} collect additional remains including a scapula (specimen QG152, a shoulder blade) and a fragment of a neck vertebra. These remains show that more than one individual was present, and it is possible that they do not pertain to Vulcanodon at all. Today, the Vulcanodon remains are stored in the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} is best {{represented by}} YGSP 32727, {{one of two}} specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris. It preserves both <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> sides of the dentary, back {{to the level of}} the fourth lower premolars (p4), but is also damaged at the front. The jaw is deep below p4, but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front. The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved; the three roots cluster together, with the canine root above the incisor roots, suggesting that these teeth shared some function. The mental foramen, an opening in the jawbone, is below p4. A root for the deciduous second premolar (dp2) is preserved on both the left and right sides, but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether dp2 had one or two roots. The right permanent second premolar (p2) is unerupted, but partially visible; it is a blade-shaped cutting tooth. The p3 bears a single cusp, somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth, with crests descending from it towards the front and back, and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides. It is supported by two roots, which are close together.|$|E
5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E

5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>left</b> atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties {{into the upper}} back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
