2500|$|Jett and Laguna {{entered the}} Who's Ramport Studios {{with the latter}} at the helm, and Jett's self-titled solo debut was {{released}} by Ariola Records in Europe on May 17, 1980. In the US, after the album was rejected by 23 major labels, Jett and Laguna released it independently on their new Blackheart Records label, which they started with Laguna's daughter's college savings. Laguna remembers, [...] "We couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do but print up records ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Grateful Dead formed {{during the}} era when bands {{such as the}} Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones were {{dominating}} the airwaves. [...] "The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band," [...] said Bob Weir. [...] "What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> more worth doing." [...] Former folk-scene star Bob Dylan had recently put {{out a couple of}} records featuring electric instrumentation. Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band the Lovin' Spoonful that they decided to [...] "go electric" [...] and look for a dirtier sound. Gradually, many of the East-Coast American folk musicians, formerly luminaries of the coffee-house scene, were moving in the electric direction. It was natural for Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, each of whom had been immersed in the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s, to be open-minded toward electric guitars.|$|E

6000|$|I {{might have}} retorted, [...] "He <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> the expense before he <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> How like a Scotchman!" [...] As it was, I was too anxious to be witty. I only drummed impatiently {{with my fingers}} on the table, and said, [...] "Tell me! tell me!" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{discovery}} {{seemed almost}} too much for Benjy. He could not <b>think</b> or talk <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> the remainder <b>of</b> that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that's what we {{call our}} Boston look, Cousin Lucy. You needn't have written {{anything}} to have it,--it's as general as tubercular consumption, and {{is the effect of}} our universal culture and habits of reading. I heard a New-Yorker say once that if you went into a corner grocery in Boston to buy a codfish, the man would ask you how you liked 'Lucille,' whilst he was tying it up. No, no; you mustn't be taken in by that literary look; I'm afraid the real literary men don't always have it. But I do see a literary man aboard yonder," [...] he added, craning his neck to one side, and then furtively pointing,--"the most literary man I ever knew, one of the most literary men that ever lived. His whole existence is really bound up in books; he never talks <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> and never <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> I believe. Look at him,--what kind and pleasant eyes he's got! There, he sees me!" [...] cries Cousin Frank, with a pleasurable excitement. [...] "How d'ye do?" [...] he calls out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, can you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{that would}} be useful? If so, you can buy it {{tomorrow}} before you come out to meet me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am so puzzled. I can {{scarcely}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> till {{you tell me}} what you mean in the bit about being [...] "called late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} very much, Philip, as a friend. But I can't bear to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I don't like you that way. I couldn't, Philip." ...|$|E
60|$|Lucy made {{no answer}} to this indiscreet and foolish speech. Why it was made, I scarce knew myself; but the heart has its bitter moods, when it prompts sentiments and {{declarations}} that are very little in accordance with its real impulses. I was so much ashamed of what I had just said, and, in truth, so much frightened, that, instead of attempting to laugh it off, as a silly, unmeaning opinion, or endeavouring to explain {{that this was not}} my own way of thinking, I walked on some distance in silence, myself, and suffered my companion to imitate me in this particular. I have since had reason to think that Lucy was not pleased at my manner of treating the subject, though, blessed creature! she had another matter to communicate, that lay too heavy on her heart, to allow one of her generous, disinterested nature to <b>think</b> much <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Huffman {{says that}} after seeing her as Lynette Scavo on [...] "Housewives" [...] for eight years it's {{difficult}} for audiences to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> She says that's why she was eager for a role that's a distinctive departure. After Desperate Housewives finale, Huffman reunited with playwright David Mamet in the comedy play November. The play debuted on September 26 and ended on November 4, 2012. In 2012, she also appeared in the ensemble cast independent movie, Trust Me, opposite Clark Gregg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad, it's {{a blessing}} to see you just the same. I'm a little dizzy with all these changes. Bertha grown up and Leo {{within an inch of}} being married! To Alice Graham at that, whom I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> yet as <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> than the long-legged, black-eyed imp of {{mischief}} she was when a kiddy. To tell you the truth, Dad, I don't feel in a mood for going to a wedding at Wish-ton-wish tonight. I'm sure you don't either. You've always hated fusses. Can't we shirk it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't imagine," [...] Marian on this {{occasion}} said to her, [...] "how you can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{in the world but}} the horrid way we're situated." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{another time}} Christie would have {{questioned}} the convincing quality of this proof, {{but she was too}} much shocked at her father's first suggestion, to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Turnbull, whose {{powers of}} {{surprise}} were exhausted, rolled his round grey eyes and said, [...] "Mr. Wilkinson, I think," [...] {{because he could}} not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to say.|$|E
60|$|Outside {{the wind}} was {{thrashing}} the broad, leafy top of the maple whose tallest twigs reached to the funny grey eaves of our old house. One roly-poly little sparrow blew or flew to the sill and {{sat there for a}} minute, looking at me with knowing eyes. Down below I could see Murray {{in a corner of the}} yard, pottering over a sick duck. He had set its broken leg and was nursing it back to health. Anyone except Uncle Abimelech could see that Murray was simply born to be a doctor and that it was flying in the face <b>of</b> Providence to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> making him <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When Ernest said {{he wished}} to retire {{it was about the}} wisest thing he could have said or done, and it suited Teuta and me down to the ground. I could see that the dear girl was {{agitated}} about something, so thought it would be best for her to be quiet, and not worried with being civil to the Bounder. Though he is my cousin, I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him as <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> The Voivode and I had certain matters to attend to arising out of the meeting of the Council, and when we were through the night was closing in. When I saw Teuta in our own rooms she said at once: ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{it is an}} irritating and pathetic {{thing that}} the three most popular phrases about Shaw are false. Modern criticism, like all weak things, is {{overloaded}} with words. In a healthy condition of language a man finds {{it very difficult to}} say the right thing, but at last says it. In this empire of journalese a man finds it so very easy to say the wrong thing that he never <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> saying <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> False or meaningless phrases lie so ready to his hand that it is easier to use them than not to use them. These wrong terms picked up through idleness are retained through habit, and so the man has begun to think wrong almost before he has begun to think at all. Such lumbering logomachy is always injurious and oppressive to men of spirit, imagination or intellectual honour, and it has dealt very recklessly and wrongly with Bernard Shaw. He has contrived to get about three newspaper phrases tied to his tail; and those newspaper phrases are all and separately wrong. The three superstitions about him, it will be conceded, are generally these: first that he desires [...] "problem plays," [...] second that he is [...] "paradoxical," [...] and third that in his dramas as elsewhere he is specially [...] "a Socialist." [...] And {{the interesting thing is that}} when we come to his philosophy, all these three phrases are quite peculiarly inapplicable.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{too excited}} over {{the theft of}} the horses to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> I reckon," [...] was the reply Chet made. [...] "It was enough to upset any one's mind." ...|$|E
60|$|LIZA. Perhaps I {{could make}} {{something}} of him. But I never thought of us making anything of one another; and you never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I only want to be natural.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I can't do that. I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> It's {{to bridge}} over the day that's left before Seeing Ghosts. If it does freeze, you'll come to Mrs. Westangle's {{afternoon}} tea on the pond?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{they are}} so rudely enacted in our presence," [...] said Catharine, [...] "it is {{a little hard to}} expect us to <b>think</b> or speak <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I will grant you, my father, that this valiant burgess of Perth {{is one of the best}} hearted men that draws breath within its walls: that he would walk a hundred yards out of the way rather than step upon a worm; that he would be as loth, in wantonness, to kill a spider as if he were a kinsman to King Robert, of happy memory; that in the last quarrel before his {{departure}} he fought with four butchers, to prevent their killing a poor mastiff that had misbehaved in the bull ring, and narrowly escaped the fate of the cur that he was protecting. I will grant you also, that the poor never pass the house of the wealthy armourer but they are relieved with food and alms. But what avails all this, when his sword makes as many starving orphans and mourning widows as his purse relieves?" ...|$|R
60|$|DOCTOR. As much as <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> His Grace never {{reminds me}} <b>of</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} heard <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> having {{happened}} to anybody.|$|R
60|$|The Echo-dwarf did {{not stop}} to break the key of the tree. He was too happy to be {{released}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> and he hastened {{as fast as he}} could to his home on the rocky hillside.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to do {{but come}} {{straight}} here to you," [...] said Honora, gazing at her friend. [...] "And oh, I'm so glad to find you. There's not another train to Quicksands till after nine." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the hunters}} now scattered, Ebony had some {{difficulty}} in keeping {{close enough to}} the chief to observe his movements. Voalavo himself was too intent upon his work to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> or to care who was near him.|$|E
50|$|The Brink of Disaster — {{the title}} of the second episode, adopted for a fan list in the seeming absence <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ralph {{had nothing}} to say as to the {{argument}} between his friend and the stranger, and in the absence <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> to say, he asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{tells us}} to notify the police, but we did that at once. I don't know <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> we can do, Gran'pa, until Josie comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} was," [...] I replied, {{with some}} embarrassment at the determined suddenness of the question, and then, endeavouring {{to give a}} complimentary turn to my frank avowal--"How is it possible I should <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> seated as I have the happiness to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s a {{good idea}} o’ the boy’s. You leave his ears alone," [...] said Joe, {{stopping}} the ready hand of the exasperated Dan. [...] "He’s got more sense than any of us. Can you <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> Billy? What shall we do then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so sure o' that, lass. No, we durstn't risk it, an' I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Poor Tolly! he'll stand a bad chance, for he's sure to come gallopin' up, an' singin' {{at the top}} of {{his voice}} in his usual {{reckless}} way." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he sat {{himself down}} {{on the grass and}} began to examine his arrows one by one, to all {{appearance}} taking no heed <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ellis {{shrugged his}} shoulders. He had no {{prospect}} <b>of</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> and sixteen dollars {{were better than}} nothing. [...] "Very well, I'll take it," [...] he said.|$|R
