500|$|By the 16thcentury, {{centralized}} kingdoms {{had emerged}} {{on the west}} coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The Merina sovereigns celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath (fandroana). For this ceremony, a beef confit called jaka (...) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with suet, then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and drizzled with honey, a preparation known as tatao (...) [...] According to oral history, King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina. Ralambo's father, King Andriamanelo, is credited with introducing the marriage tradition of the vodiondry (...) or [...] "rump of the sheep," [...] wherein the most favored cut of meat—the hindquarters—was offered by the groom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> the bride-to-be at an engagement ceremony. In contemporary Malagasy society the terminology persists but families are more likely to offer symbolic coins in place of an offering of food.|$|E

500|$|With the {{announcement}} by Islam4UK that it planned {{to hold a}} protest march through Wootton Bassett (known for the military funeral repatriations of dead British soldiers returning {{from the war in}} Afghanistan), Choudary said [...] "You may see one or two coffins being returned to the UK every other day, but {{when you think about the}} people of Afghanistan its a huge number [...] in comparison ... I intend to write a letter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> <b>of</b> British soldiers telling them the reality of what they died for." [...] Choudary's open letter was published on 3 January 2010. [...] It explained his reasons for proposing the march, endorsed his religious beliefs, and claimed that UK politicians had been lying about the war. [...] Choudary wrote that the proposed march was to [...] "engage the British public's minds on the real reasons why their soldiers are returning home in body bags and the real cost of the war." [...] In an interview with Sky News, he stated that the location was chosen to effect a level of media attention which [...] "it would not have gained anywhere else". [...] The proposal was condemned by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, who said that to offend the families of dead or wounded troops would be [...] "completely inappropriate". [...] The Minhaj-ul-Quran International UK centre in Forest Gate also condemned the proposal, as did the Muslim Council of Britain, which stated that it [...] "condemns the call by the fringe extremist group Islam4UK for their proposed march in Wootton Bassett."

[...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts {{that he did not}} add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over. It is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans. All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons." [...] Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries, [...] "La Crema" [...] is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico.|$|E
