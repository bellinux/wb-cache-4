She took that photo of me, but she was just like, ‘I can’t talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> you’re crazy and you’re a terrorist. And I’m like, ‘I’m not. I’m a Tamil and there are people dying in my country and you have to like look at it because you’re fucking Oprah and every American told me you’re going to save the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on Total Request Live, Aguilera revealed that upon hearing Clarkson's version of the track, she became miffed that RCA, which was also her record label, decided to release it without her permission - however she also praised Clarkson's vocal performance. She told Clarkson on the air, [...] "if the song {{was to go to}} anyone I'm glad that it went <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> you gave it justice." [...] In 2010, Clarkson told the Bournemouth Daily Echo that [...] "I had to argue with the record label to the point of literally crying to get 'Miss Independent' on the album, then they released it as my debut single and it was a hit." ...|$|E

500|$|As I Lay Dying entered Big Fish {{recording}} studio in Encinitas, California, US in January 2005 {{to record their}} third studio album. Shadows Are Security was released in June {{of the same year}} and debuted at No.1 on the Independent Albums chart. It was also the band's first release to enter the Billboard 200—at No.35—and sold about 275,000 copies. Wade Kergan of Allmusic called it [...] "one of the strongest releases of 2005," [...] and commented that new guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa make the band [...] "stronger." [...] Rod Smith of Decibel Magazine commented: [...] "Tim Lambesis's finely honed roar in bittersweet instrumental matrices augmented by occasional clean vocals by bass guitarist Clint Norris. Guitarists Phil Sgrosso and Nick Hipa whip up a melodic cyclone on 'The Darkest Nights'." [...] By this time, guitarist Evan White had quit the band for personal reasons after his mother died. All the singing was done by Dave Arthur of Kings <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> <b>because</b> it sounded more powerful in the studio in comparison to Clint Norris's singing.|$|E
500|$|Released on June 7, 2005, the {{collection}} has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five, praising {{the quality of}} the episodes included in the set, but ultimately finding that they were best viewed {{in the context of the}} [...] "standalone" [...] episodes which were omitted—singling out [...] "Conduit" [...] and [...] "The Jersey Devil" [...] as episodes which would aid the series' [...] "dual character study". Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated {{the collection}} eight out of ten, finding that the mythology-based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze", not included in the collection, he added that [...] "even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver-eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success". However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough [...] "to keep us from complaining". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that [...] "whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1: Abduction is a must". Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking [...] "should you buy Abduction? It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> chances are, if you love the X-Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once".|$|E
2500|$|On 30 November Chan's pro-democratic {{supporters}} {{warned the}} public about the consequences of further pro-Beijing influences. [...] Former head of ICAC and Chan's adviser Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying wrote, [...] "I am sending out this personal appeal <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> Hong Kong is in great danger of being dominated by one voice and one party under different guises, where everyone fears expressing his or her choice and preference. [...] This will happen sooner than we think unless we all act NOW." ...|$|E

And a time may come when this knot is tied so tight that the person who tied it is no longer capable of untying it, and then the knot will have to be cut. What that would mean I need not explain <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> you {{yourself}} understand perfectly what dreaded forces our two countries possess." ...|$|E
2500|$|Strict NFP {{reaches a}} point where it is more harmful for a {{marriage}} than good. We think that Jesus' words in Luke 11:46 apply: [...] "And you experts in the law, woe <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry." [...] How is it that spouses are saying [...] "yes" [...] to the gift of each other when they end up abstaining for much of their married lives? ... We also see honest congruity with the language of the body by saying [...] "no" [...] to conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our minds and hearts are also saying [...] "no" [...] to conception. We don’t believe this angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or divorce. We strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin.|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao was {{preparing}} for another campaign against Yuan Shang (who had fled to join his second brother Yuan Xi and the Wuhuan tribes), many of his followers were worried that Liu Biao might send Liu Bei (who had become a vassal under Liu Biao) to attack Cao Cao's base, the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). However, Guo Jia said to Cao Cao, [...] "Your military might may be very well known now, but the Wuhuan will definitely not set up defences because they are deluded by {{a false sense of}} security since they are far away from you. As such, if you seize this opportunity to launch a surprise attack on them, you can eliminate them. Besides, Yuan Shao treated the ethnic minorities well and the Yuan brothers are still alive. Now, the people of northern China submit <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> they fear your military might, and you've yet to pacify them through benevolent governance. If you abandon the campaign and head south instead, the Wuhuan and Yuan Shao's former followers might rally the support of the people in northern China, who are likely to respond to their call. When that happens, the attention of Tadun (a Wuhuan chieftain) will be aroused and he may think of attacking you, and by then we would have lost Qing and Ji provinces. Liu Biao is a person who does nothing but sit and talk. He also does not trust Liu Bei as the latter is more capable than him – if he entrusts Liu Bei with important responsibilities, he will be worried that the latter will no longer submit to him; if he gives Liu Bei trivial tasks to do, the latter will be reluctant to serve him. Even if you empty your territories to campaign far away, you have no worries." [...] Cao Cao proceeded with his campaign against the Yuan brothers and the Wuhuan.|$|E
