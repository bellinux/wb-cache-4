After Ritchie's retreat across Cyrenaica early in 1942 and his disastrous defeat by Rommel at Gazala, Bevan made one of his most memorable speeches in the Commons in support of a motion of censure against the Churchill government. In this he said, [...] "The Prime Minister must realise <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> there is a taunt on everyone's lips that if Rommel had been in the British Army he would still have been a sergeant ...

30|$|For {{the first}} time, the IOM made an attempt {{on a global}} {{conducted}} ballot to explore attitudes of people on migration. 48 More than 183, 000 adults across more than 140 countries between 2012 and 2014 were asked two question by Gallup. They were asked two questions on immigration: 1) In your view, should immigration <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> be kept at its present level, increased or decreased? 2) Do you think immigrants mostly take jobs <b>that</b> citizens <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> do not want (e.g. low-paying or not prestigious jobs), or mostly take jobs <b>that</b> citizens <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> want? A major finding of <b>this</b> report is <b>that</b> <b>in</b> every major region in the world, {{people are more likely}} to want the same levels of immigration or increased. The only exception was Europe: “European residents appear to be, on average, the most negative globally towards immigration, with the majority believing immigration levels should be decreased” (IOM 2015 : 1). The report also confirms a sharp divergence between North and South Europe. There are socioeconomic differences that explain people’s attitudes. Adults from countries with high unemployment rates are most negative towards immigration, whereas residents of high-income countries are more positive on immigration, and say that immigrants mostly take jobs the citizens do not want. This report identified regions and countries attitudes on migration, examined the relationship between economics and attitudes, identified where and among which demographic groups immigration is more or less accepted, and compare how public opinion aligns with government immigration policy.|$|R
