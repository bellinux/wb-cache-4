Quanser, a well-known manufacturer of educational bench-top helicopter has developed Proportional Integration Derivative (PID) controller with Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for all travel, pitch and yaw angle of the bench-top helicopter. The performance of the PID controller is relatively good; however, its performance could also be improved if the controller is combined with adaptive element. The objective {{of this research is}} to design adaptive PID controller and then compare the performances of the adaptive PID with the standard PID. The controller design and test is focused on <b>travel</b> <b>angle</b> control only. Adaptive method used in this project is self-tuning controller, which controller’s parameters are updated online. Two adaptive algorithms those are pole-placement and deadbeat have been chosen as the method to achieve optimal controller’s parameters. Performance comparisons have shown that the adaptive (deadbeat) PID controller has produced more desirable performance compared to standard PID and adaptive (pole-placement). The adaptive (deadbeat) PID controller attained very fast settling time (5 seconds) and very small percentage of overshoot (5 % to 7. 5 %) for 10 ° to 30 ° step change of <b>travel</b> <b>angle.</b> Keywords—Adaptive control, bench-top helicopter, deadbeat, pole-placement, self-tuning control.

This paper presents a technique using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify the key Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) fillet weld parameters and interactions that impact on the resultant geometry, when using a metal cored wire.

40|$|Control of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{parameters}} is key {{to maintaining}} good quality and consistent fillet weld geometry. The external geometry of the fillet weld can be easily measured, however the internal geometry (i. e. penetration), which is critical in determining the structural integrity of the joint, is difficult to measure without destructively testing the workpiece. Consequently the most cost effective way to ensure adequate penetration is to maintain close control of the input parameters. Furthermore if we can demonstrate tight control of the parameters and interactions that affect the joint penetration then we can increase the confidence that sufficient penetration is being achieved. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the variation in set up parameters between welders and the guidance given by industry/suppliers can vary widely and in some cases be contradictory. Also in practice there are several characteristics of the manual/semi-automatic GMAW fillet weld process that are difficult to control (e. g. gun angle, <b>travel</b> <b>angle</b> and gap) but yet have an impact on the resultant geometry. This paper will document a programme of work which has used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify the parameters, and specific interactions that have an impact on the resultant fillet weld geometry.

In this research, the flow mobility and impact behaviour of granular materials were investigated. Flume model tests and numerical simulations using the sled model, the dynamic analysis (Hungr, 1995) and Particle Flow Code in Three Dimensions (PFC 3 D) were conducted. Two flumes {{were used in the}} physical model tests, namely the runout flume and the barrier flume. The runout flume included an inclined channel of 1. 4 m long, 45 ° slope angle and 0. 4 m wide. The inclined channel was connected to a horizontal channel of 1. 2 m long. The <b>travel</b> <b>angle</b> was measured in each runout tests. The barrier flume consisted of an inclined channel of 3. 8 m long, 40 ° slope angle and 0. 4 m wide. The confinement angle was adjustable for both flumes. An aluminium barrier with a finite stiffness was adopted on the barrier flume. A high speed camera was used to record the impact behaviour. Leighton Buzzard sand fraction C & E, as well as completely decomposed granite (CDG) were used in physical model tests. Measured data were compared and analysed with computed results using the sled model, the dynamic analysis (Hungr, 1995) and PFC 3 D. Parametric studies using the dynamic analysis (Hungr, 1995) with different flow resistance models and PFC 3 D were conducted. Flume data revealed the existence of critical water contents. The critical water contents were around 20 % and 25 % for fraction C sand and CDG respectively. The <b>travel</b> <b>angle</b> decreased with mean particle size in a granular mixture. A critical confinement angle was observed between 0 ° and 8 ° using fraction C and fraction E sands respectively. Reverse segregation was observed using CDG soil. Back analysis of measured data shows that the sled model fails to model the effects of mass on <b>travel</b> <b>angle.</b> By including side resistance and dynamic drag in calculation using the dynamic analysis, the critical confinement angle could be captured. The deposition process has a longer duration by adopting the Bingham model than the friction model and the Voellmy model. The duration of impact was longer for fraction E sand than that of fraction C sand. No peak force was measured and progressive deposition was observed for both sands. The duration of impact was shorter for wet fraction C sand. The measured impact force reduced with the confinement angle. Parametric study using PFC 3 D shows that the maximum impact force for dry granular material is contributed mostly by static load. The computed impact force on a vertical barrier is larger than a barrier which is perpendicular to the inclined flume. By incorporating a deposition zone of 0. 5 m in front of the vertical barrier, the computed static load is reduced by around 80 %...|$|E

MR technology opens up new sensor possibilities in space applications and can be an enabling technology for optimal performance, high robustness and long lifetime at reasonable costs. In some science missions, the technology is already applied, however, the designs are proprietary and case specific, for instance in case of the angular sensors used for JPL/NASA's Mars rover Curiosity [1].

40|$|A large rock {{avalanche}} {{occurred at}} 03 : 27 : 30 PDT, 6 August 2010, in the Mount Meager Volcanic Complex southwest British Columbia. The landslide initiated {{as a rock}} slide in Pleistocene rhyodacitic volcanic rock {{with the collapse of}} the secondary peak of Mount Meager. The detached rock mass impacted the volcano's weathered and saturated flanks, creating a visible seismic signature on nearby seismographs. Undrained loading of the sloping flank caused the immediate and extremely rapid evacuation of the entire flank with a strong horizontal force, as the rock slide transformed into a debris flow. The disintegrating mass travelled down Capricorn Creek at an average velocity of 64 m s− 1 , exhibiting dramatic super-elevation in bends to the intersection of Meager Creek, 7. 8 km from the source. At Meager Creek the debris impacted the south side of Meager valley, causing a runup of 270 m above the valley floor and the deflection of the landslide debris both upstream (for 3. 7 km) and downstream into the Lillooet River valley (for 4. 9 km), where it blocked the Lillooet River river for a couple of hours, approximately 10 km from the landslide source. Deposition at the Capricorn–Meager confluence also dammed Meager Creek for about 19 h creating a lake 1. 5 km long. The overtopping of the dam and the predicted outburst flood was the basis for a night time evacuation of 1500 residents in the town of Pemberton, 65 km downstream. High-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery obtained on 16 October 2010 was used to create a post-event digital elevation model. Comparing pre- and post-event topography we estimate the volume of the initial displaced mass from the flank of Mount Meager to be 48. 5 × 10 6 m 3 , the height of the path (H) to be 2183 m and the total length of the path (L) to be 12. 7 km. This yields H/L = 0. 172 and a fahrböschung (<b>travel</b> <b>angle)</b> of 9. 75 °. The movement was recorded on seismographs in British Columbia and Washington State with the initial impact, the debris flow travelling through bends in Capricorn Creek, and the impact with Meager Creek are all evident on a number of seismograms. The landslide had a seismic trace equivalent to a M = 2. 6 earthquake. Velocities and dynamics of the movement were simulated using DAN-W. The 2010 event is the third major landslide in the Capricorn Creek watershed since 1998 and the fifth large-scale mass flow in the Meager Creek watershed since 1930.

30|$|The {{results show}} that the {{developed}} joint prototype could change its reduction ratio and produce an increased HF travel range according to the design. The maximum load of 4.8  Nm was lower than the maximum torque in the step transmission experiment. This is probably because friction losses in the rotating gear train are higher than {{that in the case of}} the non-rotating one. In addition, cable swinging during the lifting might have increased the effective load and stalled the motor at a lower load value. The HF <b>travel</b> <b>angles</b> at the designed load of 4  Nm and below were close to the designed maximum range of 220 ^∘. Deviations were caused by the variation in the output angle where the gear clutch starts engaging with the output gear. Therefore, it is safe to say that the prototype could provide an infinite travel range in HS with and upto a 4 -Nm output torque over the range of 200 ^∘ in the HF phase. This 200 ^∘ travel range in the HF phase is long enough for applications like artificial elbow and knee joints. Time delay D occurs because the clutch has to fill the space between gear teeth of G 2 and G 3 in order to be become fully engaged. D depends on the rotation speed of the clutch and module of the gear teeth. Therefore, it can be reduced by optimizing the mechanism design. On the other hand, delay E comes from the elasticity of the materials used in the mechanism and the load. As there is no perfectly stiff material, E could be lowered but could never be fully eliminated.|$|R
