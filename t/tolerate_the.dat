5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E

5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E

5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> more radical Puritans though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E

5|$|Find {{insertion}} {{sites for}} other proteins. Inserting one protein as a domain into another protein can be useful. For instance, inserting calmodulin into {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) allowed researchers to measure the activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split-GFP.

5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|Satellite males, about 16% of {{the total}} number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with the females visiting the territories {{occupied}} by the resident males. Resident males <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.|$|E

5|$|A {{hospital}} {{had originally been}} installed at Alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late 19th century. During its time as a federal penitentiary, it was located above the dining hall on the second floor. Hospital staff were U.S. Public Health Service employees assigned to the Federal Prison Service at Alcatraz. Doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at Alcatraz, because few of them could <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs. Prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital, most famously, Stroud and Al Capone, who spent years in it.|$|E
5|$|Girlschool {{embarked}} {{in a long}} US tour {{to promote}} the album, sometimes as support to Quiet Riot and Blue Öyster Cult, but more often as headliner in small venues after uncomfortable travels.

She went to live in Los Angeles with Vicki Blue, former bassist of The Runaways. With the departure of Kelly Johnson, who was often considered the visual and musical focal point of the band, the almost bankrupt Bronze Records failed to extend the band's recording contract for a follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|Hedwig Potthast, Himmler's young {{secretary}} {{starting in}} 1936, became his mistress by 1939. She left {{her job in}} 1941. He arranged accommodation for her, first in Mecklenburg and later at Berchtesgaden. He fathered two children with her: a son, Helge (born 15 February 1942) and a daughter, Nanette Dorothea (born 20 July 1944, Berchtesgaden). Margarete, by then living in Gmund with her daughter, learned of the relationship sometime in 1941; she and Himmler were already separated, and she decided to <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> relationship {{for the sake of}} her daughter. Working as a nurse for the German Red Cross during the war, Margarete was appointed supervisor in Military District III (Berlin-Brandenburg). Himmler was close to his first daughter, Gudrun, whom he nicknamed Püppi ("dolly"); he phoned her every few days and visited as often as he could.|$|E

5|$|In the 2001 {{parliamentary}} election the party lost the gains {{it had made}} according to opinion polling but maintained its position from the 1997 election, it got 14.6% and 26 members in the parliament. The election result allowed them to unseat the Labour Party government of Jens Stoltenberg {{and replace it with}} a three-party coalition led by Christian Democrat Kjell Magne Bondevik. However, the coalition continued to decline to govern together with the Progress Party as they considered the political differences too large. The Progress Party eventually decided to <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> coalition, as it promised to invest more in defence, open more private hospitals and open for more competition in the public sector. In 2002 the Progress Party again advanced in the opinion polls and for a while became the largest party.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the tulip to Europe is usually attributed to Ogier de Busbecq, the ambassador of FerdinandI, Holy Roman Emperor to the Sultan of Turkey, who sent the first tulip bulbs and seeds to Vienna in 1554 from the Ottoman Empire. Tulip bulbs were soon distributed from Vienna to Augsburg, Antwerp and Amsterdam. Its popularity and cultivation in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands) is generally thought to have started in earnest around 1593 after the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established the hortus academicus. He planted his collection of tulip bulbs and found {{they were able to}} <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> harsher conditions of the Low Countries; shortly thereafter the tulip began to grow in popularity.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, the Siberian tiger was on {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in Russia. As a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the Soviet Union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. Poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of Russia collapsed. The major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male). Current conservation efforts are led by local governments and NGO's in concert with international organisations, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters to <b>tolerate</b> <b>the</b> big cats. Tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers. In 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in Russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity. However, in a decade later, the Siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.|$|E
