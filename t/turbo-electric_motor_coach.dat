50|$|Academy's fleet {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} <b>motor</b> <b>coaches,</b> including <b>Motor</b> <b>Coach</b> Industries motorcoaches, which are used for commuter and charter services. Nova Bus LFS, RTS, and New Flyer Industries D60LF buses are used for university contracts and charters. Services operated under contract to New Jersey Transit use NJT-owned and branded Nova Bus RTS and North American Bus Industries buses. Many of Academy's <b>Motor</b> <b>Coach</b> Industries and Nova Bus RTS bus fleet are owned by New Jersey Transit and leased to Academy. These NJT-owned buses are Academy-branded and used on services directly controlled by Academy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>coaches</b> {{can replace}} {{locomotives}} {{at the head}} of local passenger or freight trains. Especially electrified narrow gauge lines on the European continent often saw this form of operation. Many of these railways closed down, many others changed to electric multiple units. But a few lines in Switzerland, Italy and Austria still work with train consists hauled by <b>motor</b> <b>coaches.</b> It can be expected that the Bernina line of Rhaetian Railway will continue {{for a long time to}} be operated with <b>motor</b> <b>coaches</b> pulling passenger and freight trains.|$|R

2500|$|The trains {{were run}} in five-car formations, <b>Motor</b> <b>coach</b> + trailer + trailer + trailer + <b>motor</b> <b>coach,</b> with spares for overhaul. They were {{constructed}} of welded steel, and were styled in an Art Deco appearance. The <b>motor</b> <b>coaches</b> had cabs at each end, enabling single-car operation by them; {{they had two}} axle-hung traction motors rated at [...] for one hour. The new trains had on-board compressors for the air brakes, and interior lights were in two circuits, one fed from the motor car {{at one end of}} the unit, and one from the other, avoiding total lighting loss in passing conductor rail gaps. The conductor rail was altered to the outside position normal for the third-rail system. There was no train power line, and each <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> collected its own electric supply. (This new stock was eventually classified Class 487.) ...|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the University of Vermont {{began the}} Green Coach Certification {{research}} project, {{which sought to}} investigate what efficiency standards would be best applied to <b>motor</b> <b>coaches</b> to promote greater energy sustainability. Research was conducted on actual <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> companies. It also researched whether a certification program could help reduce environmental impacts from the <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> industry by educating operators and executives about the benefits, both financial and environmental, of adopting fuel saving strategies and switching to alternative sources of fuel. Upon completion of this pilot program the Certification for Sustainable Transportation was founded {{as a way to}} expand the size and scope of the initial program. The CST now works well beyond the <b>motor</b> <b>coach</b> industry, deploying its driver training programs to taxi drivers and school bus operators, and offering its eRating certification to vehicle manufacturers, public transportation industries, and pedi-cab operators.|$|R
