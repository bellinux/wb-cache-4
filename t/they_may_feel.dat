25|$|Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and {{patients}} are commonly warned <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> dizzy or faint {{after taking the}} first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine.|$|E
25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> that their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> as if their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual’s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E
25|$|Regression {{towards the}} mean – since many {{diseases}} or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary {{over time and}} patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> better anyway {{but because of the}} timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the preparation taken.|$|E
25|$|Antidepressants {{can cause}} {{emotional}} blunting, or numbness. This is {{a reduction in}} extremes of emotion, both positive and negative. While the patient <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> less depressed, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also <b>feel</b> less happiness or empathy in some situations. This may be cause for a dose reduction or medication change. The exact mechanism is unknown.|$|R

Customers <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> {{discouraged}} from patronizing establishments using them. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> also <b>feel</b> that tip jars are inappropriate at certain types of establishments such as movie-theater concession counters, dry cleaners, take-out restaurants, gym locker rooms or grocery bagger's work stations. Many feel social pressure to use them, or that they are paying too high a total price when purchasing a simple item.|$|R
25|$|The {{prohibition}} of dual citizenship is a contentious issue in Singapore. As the economy becomes more globalized and Singaporeans more mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenship even though <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> a strong emotional attachment to Singapore. Immigrants {{who have been}} resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean citizenship {{may be reluctant to}} become naturalized citizens as it would mean giving up the citizenship of their native countries.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{may feel}} {{emotions}} with greater ease, depth {{and for a}} longer time than others do. A core characteristic of BPD is affective instability, which generally manifests as unusually intense emotional responses to environmental triggers, with a slower return to a baseline emotional state. People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard for people and great disappointment in them. In Marsha Linehan's view, the sensitivity, intensity, and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have {{both positive and negative}} effects. People with BPD are often exceptionally enthusiastic, idealistic, joyful, and loving. However, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> overwhelmed by negative emotions ("anxiety, depression, guilt/shame, worry, anger, etc."), experiencing intense grief instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of nervousness.|$|E
25|$|Most people {{engage in}} sexual {{activity}} because of pleasure they derive from the arousal of their sexuality, especially if they can achieve orgasm. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from foreplay and flirting, and from fetish or BDSM activities, or other erotic activities. Most commonly, people {{engage in sexual}} activity because of the sexual desire generated by a person to whom they feel sexual attraction; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve {{in the absence of}} attraction for another, {{as in the case of}} casual or social sex. At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> for the partner.|$|E
50|$|Middle {{adulthood}} generally {{refers to}} the period between ages 25 to 69.

2500|$|American gender theorist Judith Butler {{argues that}} the process of [...] "coming out" [...] does not free gay people from oppression. Although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> free to act as themselves, the opacity {{involved}} in entering a non-heterosexual territory insinuates judgment upon their identity, she argues in Imitation and Gender Insubordination (1991).|$|E
2500|$|Although nature {{relatedness}} is {{a stable}} individual trait, it can change based on one's experience with nature, [...] meaning {{the more time}} an individual spends in nature, the more connected they feel to nature and the more concern <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> for nature. Feeling connected to nature at a state level has many benefits as well such as more positive moods and less negative moods.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mental and}} sexual {{health effects of}} {{biphobia}} on bisexual people are numerous. Studies show that bisexuals are often trapped in between the binaries of heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating a form of invalidation around their sexual identity. This often leads to recognized indicators of mental health issues such as low self-esteem and self-worth. These indicators and pressures to [...] "choose" [...] a sexual identity can, in many cases, lead to depression as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> {{they live in a}} culture that does not recognize their existence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{lifestyle}} led by undercover agents is {{very different}} compared to other areas in law enforcement, {{and it can be}} quite difficult to reintegrate back into normal duties. [...] Agents work their own hours, they are removed from direct supervisory monitoring, and they can ignore the dress and etiquette rules. [...] So resettling back into the normal police role requires the shedding of old habits, language and dress. [...] After working such free lifestyles, agents may have discipline problems or exhibit neurotic responses. [...] <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable, and take a cynical, suspicious or even paranoid world view and feel continually on guard.|$|E
2500|$|People with {{hypomania}} or mania {{may experience}} a decreased need of sleep, impaired judgment, and speak excessively and very rapidly. [...] Manic individuals {{often have a}} history of substance abuse developed over years as a form of [...] "self-medication". At the more extreme, a person in a full blown manic state can experience psychosis; a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> unstoppable, or as if they have been [...] "chosen" [...] and are on a [...] "special mission", or have other grandiose or delusional ideas. This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale, though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to the neocortical {{component}} of human functioning, when human beings lose a primary relationship, they grasp its potential repercussions (i.e. <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> uncertain {{about the future}} or fear being unable {{to climb out of}} an abyss), thus encumbering an additional layer of separation stress. [...] To abandon is [...] "to withdraw one's support or help from, especially in spite of duty, allegiance, or responsibility; desert: abandon a friend in trouble." [...] When the loss is due to the object’s voluntary withdrawal, a common response is to feel unworthy of love. [...] This indicates the tendency for people to blame the rejection on themselves. [...] "Am I unworthy of love, destined to grow old and die all alone, bereft of human connection or caring?" [...] Questioning one’s desirability as a mate and fearing eternal isolation are among the additional anxieties incurred in abandonment scenarios. The concurrence of self devaluation and primal fear distinguish abandonment grief from most other types of bereavement.|$|E

These teacher educators will usually have moved from successful, and often senior, school-teacher roles and <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> a sense of ‘expert becoming novice’ as they experience the joys and the pressures of life as an academic. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> also <b>feel</b> that there is a case of ‘novice assumed to be expert’ in the educational research element of their new role.

2500|$|Another common {{feeling that}} {{many people who are}} adopted deal with is a feeling of guilt. This guilt is felt towards both their birth {{families}} as well as their adoptive families. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> guilty towards their birth family because in many ways, they have accepted their adoptive family as their own and would not want their birth family to be upset or jealous. Many adoptees call their adoptive parents [...] "mom" [...] and [...] "dad" [...] and refer to adoptive siblings as such, which adoptees feel may hurt their biological families, should they find out. The sense of guilt towards adoptive parents comes from curiosity about biological families. Adoptees often feel that any curiosity about their origins and their birth families may hurt their adoptive one. They believe that the adoptive family will feel a sense of betrayal for wanting to know about where they came from, especially if the adoption allows for access to such information. Adoptees may also fear that their adoptive family may love them less because of their curiosity.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cognitive}} {{models of}} social anxiety disorder, those with social phobias experience dread over {{how they will}} be presented to others. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> overly self-conscious, pay high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for themselves. According to the social psychology theory of self-presentation, a sufferer attempts to create a well-mannered impression towards others but believes he or she is unable to do so. Many times, prior to the potentially anxiety-provoking social situation, sufferers may deliberately review what could go wrong and how to deal with each unexpected case. [...] After the event, they may have the perception that they performed unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will perceive anything that may have possibly been abnormal as embarrassing. These thoughts may extend for weeks or longer. Cognitive distortions are a hallmark, and are learned about in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Thoughts are often self-defeating and inaccurate. Those with social phobia tend to interpret neutral or ambiguous conversations with a negative outlook, and many studies suggest that socially anxious individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.|$|E
2500|$|Insight 3 – No {{matter how}} well they have gained {{insights}} 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2015, Treach {{said he and}} Vinnie had {{resolved}} their issues, but {{now their}} relationship is strictly [...] "business." [...] "You got teammates, sometimes, that's on the same team, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not <b>feel</b> each other. At {{the end of the}} day, you going out to win. That's what we doing," [...] Treach said. Although Vinnie and Treach are cordial, he said another Naughty By Nature album was unlikely.|$|R
2500|$|The {{third is}} the [...] "children in moderation" [...] group. In Rainey’s view, these Protestants are very pro-child but {{feel free to}} use {{artificial}} birth control to prudently plan their families. Those within this group see Divine Providence and Biblically required responsibility acting via man's free will as working complementarily. <b>They</b> thus <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> freedom to use non-"natural" [...] birth control in making personal choices in consultation with God about the number and spacing of children.|$|R
50|$|Perceptions {{of mental}} health may also alter patient beliefs about the {{effectiveness}} {{of mental health}} treatment. Patients receive cues on therapist expertise through their interactions, and <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> the therapist is inadequate. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> also <b>feel</b> that <b>they</b> do not share the same treatment goals. It's also possible that the initial perception that treatment is ineffective can lead to patient's seeking a reason to end treatment. Lastly, a client may have an expectation about how many sessions they will be attending. This number strongly predicts the number of sessions actually attended, which may differ from the number the therapist feels is necessary, leading to dropout.|$|R
2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type tend {{to agree}} with the following statements: [...] "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{cognitive}} {{responses in}} the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will begin to feel that anything and everything they do is not enough to keep their unfaithful partner from straying which in turn makes them feel incompetent. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>feel</b> incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to change their behavior in hopes of keeping or getting their partner’s attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with (Johnson, 2017). People cheat for many reasons and each of those can cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner’s actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner’s actions. The accuser begins to anticipate feeling rejected by their significant other, therefore, they have resentful cognitive responses towards the accused.|$|E
