5|$|Rock art {{is found}} {{throughout}} the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a <b>travel</b> <b>route</b> and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people.|$|E

25|$|The {{section of}} the road between Mercersburg and the Maryland border was {{constructed}} as part of two 19th-century turnpikes which served {{as part of a}} <b>travel</b> <b>route</b> between Pittsburgh and Baltimore. The state took over the road in 1917 and it became a part of the Buchanan Highway, which ran between Mount Union and the Maryland border in Carroll Valley. The {{section of the}} present route in McConnellsburg became part of the Lincoln Highway in 1913, PA 1 in 1924, and US 30 in 1926, with PA 1 removed from US 30 two years later. PA 16 was designated in 1928 to run along the Buchanan Trail between US 30 (Lincoln Way) in McConnellsburg and MD 32 (now MD 140) at the Maryland border southeast of Carroll Valley, replacing the previous PA 51 designation that had been assigned to the road a year earlier. A related route PA 851 is evidence of the route's former designation. The route was realigned across South Mountain by 1941. The west end of PA 16 was extended along Lincoln Way to US 522 in 1967 after US 30 was rerouted to bypass McConnellsburg to the north.|$|E
500|$|Lake Champlain, {{which forms}} {{part of the}} border between New York and Vermont, and the Hudson River {{together}} formed an important <b>travel</b> <b>route</b> that was used by Indians {{before the arrival of}} European colonists. [...] The route was relatively free of obstacles to navigation, with only a few portages. [...] One strategically important place on the route lies at a narrows near the southern end of Lake Champlain, where Ticonderoga Creek, known in Colonial times as the La Chute River, enters the lake, carrying water from Lake George.

500|$|Carillon, {{located near}} the {{southern}} end of Lake Champlain, occupied a place that was strategic in importance even before Samuel de Champlain discovered it in 1609, controlling access to a key portage trail between Champlain and Lake George along the main <b>travel</b> <b>route</b> between the Hudson River valley and the Saint Lawrence River. [...] When the war began, the area was part of the frontier between the British province of New York and the French province of Canada, and the British had stopped French advances further south in the 1755 Battle of Lake George. [...] However, the fort was constructed in a difficult location: in order to build on rock, the French had sited it relatively far from the lake, while it was still below nearby hilltops.|$|E

[...] The expedition arrived at its first target, Fort Halifax, a decaying relic of the French and Indian War, on the second day. [...] There was a rough track from Fort Western, so some of the men and supplies had moved overland rather than in the bateaux that had to be portaged around the falls above Fort Western to begin the trip. [...] Arnold, rather than traveling in a heavy bateau, traveled in a lighter canoe so that he might move more rapidly among the troops along the <b>travel</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} reasons the Mormons were able to colonize Arizona was the {{existence}} of Jacob Hamblin's ferry across the Colorado at Lee's Ferry (then known as Pahreah Crossing), which began running in March 1864. This location was the only section of river for hundreds of miles in both directions where the canyon walls dropped away, allowing {{for the development of a}} transport route. John Doyle Lee established a more permanent ferry system at the site in 1870. One reason Lee chose to run the ferry was to flee from Mormon leaders who held him responsible for the Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which 120 emigrants in a wagon train were killed by a local militia disguised as Native Americans. Even though it was located along a major <b>travel</b> <b>route,</b> Lee's Ferry was very isolated, and there Lee and his family established the aptly named Lonely Dell Ranch. In 1928, the ferry sank, resulting in the deaths of three men. Later that year, the Navajo Bridge was completed at a point [...] downstream, rendering the ferry obsolete.|$|E
