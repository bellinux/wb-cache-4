Our study examines this belief by exploring {{the effects of}} two such systems {{on the quality of}} employees 2 ̆ 7 desired benefit choices and satisfaction with benefits in a flexible benefits environment. Results show that employees 2 ̆ 7 current benefit choices and desired benefit changes are related to satisfaction with benefits. <b>Those</b> <b>using</b> both computerized decision aids signaled benefit choice intentions that more closely corresponded to expert system recommendations than <b>those</b> not <b>using</b> a decision aid, but <b>those</b> <b>using</b> the expert system desired to make more expert-like decisions than <b>those</b> <b>using</b> the decision support system. In addition, <b>those</b> <b>using</b> the expert system had greater satisfaction with benefits than <b>those</b> not <b>using</b> a decision aid and <b>those</b> <b>using</b> the decision support system. These results suggest that expert systems have potential for improving decision making and influencing employees 2 ̆ 7 attitudes for human resource problems...|$|R

The ability to follow separate lines of melody is an important factor in music appreciation.
