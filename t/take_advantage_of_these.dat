5|$|With the {{popularity}} of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if Brütal Legend would <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less skilled players, bonus coins and 1-ups are more abundant in earlier worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for more experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play time. The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures {{as a means of}} providing him with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a centaur but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail that allows limited flying ability. Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were designed to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> abilities. New enemies were included to add diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as Goombas, Hammer Bros., and Koopa Troopas.|$|E

25|$|The {{taxpayer}} whose residence {{has been}} ‘locked’ into a trust {{has now been}} given another opportunity to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person {{the opportunity to take}} transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that it will ever become available thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The Estonian Swedes' {{positions}} improved {{during the}} 1850s and 1860s, due to further agrarian reforms, but discrimination remained {{during the rest}} of the period of Tsarist rule in Estonia. After the First World War and the Russian Revolution, the independent Republic of Estonia was created in 1918. The constitution of independent Estonia granted the ethnic minority groups the control over their language of education, the right to form institutions for their national and social rights, the right to use their native language in official capacities where they formed majorities of the population, and the choice of nationality. Swedes, Baltic Germans, Russians, and Jews all had ministers in the new national government. Svenska Folkförbundet, a Swedish political organization, was formed. In 1925, a new law giving more cultural autonomy was passed, although the Russians and Swedes in Estonia did not <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> new freedoms, mainly for economic reasons.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the impact and creation of institutions during early state formation, economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization. They found that the beginnings of {{the success or failure of}} American colonies were based on the specific factor endowments available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as plantations, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.|$|E

The positrons travel a short distance in tissue and then annihilate with an electron giving off two nearly back-to-back gamma rays.

25|$|In 1965, mayoral {{candidate}} John Lindsay {{pledged to}} use the toll revenues from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) to offset the NYCTA's deficits. In January 1966, New York State, {{with the help of}} Governor Nelson Rockefeller. purchased the Long Island Rail Road, from it corporate parent, the Pennsylvania Railroad, becoming part of the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (MCTA). Rockefeller saw the difficulty that John Lindsey, who had since won the mayoral election, had in his plan {{to use the}} TBTA surpluses for the NYCTA, and decided to expand the MCTA to give it oversight to the NYCTA and the TBTA. The MCTA would be renamed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Tied to a bill with the creation of the MTA was a $2.5 billion bond issue that would be approved or disapproved by voters in November 1967. A majority of the bonds would go to the state's mass transit systems, with a majority going to New York City, and to Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, and Orange Counties. The day prior to the election, two brand new R40 cars were displayed on the IND Sixth Avenue Line at Herald Square. The bond issue passed, and the MTA was set to take over the NYCTA in 1968. The night before December 31, 1967, the NYCTA and the TWU made an agreement to avoid a strike. The deal gave NYCTA workers the ability to retire with about half-pay after twenty years if the employee was over fifty years old. This would later cause problems, as large numbers of transit workers would retire to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> benefits On March 1, 1968 the NYCTA, and its subsidiary, the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority (MaBSTOA), were placed under the control of, and are now affiliates of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).|$|E

The GNR granted the NSR running rights to Nottingham, Colwick, Leicester and Peterborough.

The A7 processor is designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung. The A7 processor {{is accompanied by a}} new M7 [...] "motion co-processor", a dedicated processor for processing motion data from the iPhone's accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the main processor, which integrates with iOS 7's new CoreMotion APIs. The same A7 SoC and M7 motion co-processor are also found in the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 which were released in the same quarter as the iPhone 5S.|$|E

The depression rapidly intensified as it moved to the west, becoming Tropical Storm Jose just six hours later. The global model guidance initially failed to resolve the storm's track well, with some models indicating that it would stall offshore. Jose continued to strengthen as it moved towards the coast and made landfall north of Veracruz city early on August 23 with winds reaching a peak of 60mph (95km/h). As Jose made its landfall an eye was beginning to form, although the storm was still well short of hurricane intensity. Tropical Storm Jose quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated that afternoon in the mountains of central Mexico only 24hours after forming.|$|E
