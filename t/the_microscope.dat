5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{the brain}} became more {{sophisticated}} {{with the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> {{and the development of a}} silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the 1870s. This was able to show the intricate structures of single neurons. This was used by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the then revolutionary hypothesis that the neuron is the functional unit {{of the brain}}. He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed functions for the cells he saw. For this, Golgi and Cajal are considered the founders of twentieth century neuroscience, both sharing the Nobel prize in 1906 for their studies and discoveries in this field.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} types of microscopes, {{and they may be}} grouped in {{different}} ways. One way is to describe the way the instruments interact with a sample to create images, either by sending a beam of light or electrons to a sample in its optical path, or by scanning across, and a short distance from, the surface of a sample using a probe. <b>The</b> most common <b>microscope</b> (and <b>the</b> first to be invented) is <b>the</b> optical <b>microscope,</b> which uses light to pass through a sample to produce an image. Other major types of <b>microscopes</b> are <b>the</b> fluorescence <b>microscope,</b> <b>the</b> electron <b>microscope</b> (both, <b>the</b> transmission electron <b>microscope</b> and <b>the</b> scanning electron <b>microscope)</b> and <b>the</b> various types of scanning probe microscopes.|$|R

5|$|The {{possible}} {{existence of}} unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, {{such as in}} Jain scriptures from 6th century BC India, and the 1st century BC book On Agriculture by Marcus Terentius Varro. Microbiology, {{the scientific study of}} microorganisms, began with their observation under <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> in the 1670s by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the 1850s, Louis Pasteur found that microorganisms caused food spoilage, debunking the theory of spontaneous generation. In the 1880s Robert Koch discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases tuberculosis, cholera, and anthrax.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{coupled with}} the new Linnaean system of binomial nomenclature resulted in plant encyclopaedias without medicinal information called Floras that meticulously described and illustrated the plants growing in particular regions. The 17th century also {{marked the beginning of}} experimental botany and application of a rigorous scientific method, while improvements in <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> launched the new discipline of plant anatomy whose foundations, laid by the careful observations of Englishman Nehemiah Grew and Italian Marcello Malpighi, would last for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes brittle. Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. Brittle fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under <b>the</b> <b>microscope.</b> These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E

5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels‚Äîthe Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10‚Äì13 by 6‚Äì7Œºm. The spores have an apical germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 22‚Äì35 by 7‚Äì10Œºm. There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band {{on the edges}} of the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged in the middle and tapered toward both ends) with an sharp tip, and measure 25‚Äì30 by 6‚Äì9Œºm. The cap cuticle (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline hyphae that are 0.8‚Äì5.5Œºm in diameter.|$|E

The presence of yolk platelets within the yolk nuclei lends support to classical observations on the synthesis of yolk within yolk nuclei or yolk nuclei derivatives. Small granules (about 100 A) are included within the double walled lamellae and their presence probably accounts for the basophilic nature of the entire body. The presence of small granules attached to electron-dense layers relates the yolk nuclei described here to ergastoplasm discussed by others...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Depicting the {{eyepiece}} of <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> is Gamma Microscopii, which‚Äîat magnitude of4.68‚Äîis {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229¬±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380¬±30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182¬±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is a {{relatively}} new science that became systematic after the development of <b>the</b> <b>microscope</b> in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera. Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated. Extending the use of the binomial system of nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761‚Äì1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern mycology. Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794‚Äì1878) further elaborated the classification of fungi, using spore color and various microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th‚Äì19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, the brothers Louis Ren√© and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo. The 20th century has seen a modernization of mycology that has come from advances in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and biodiversity, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy.|$|E
