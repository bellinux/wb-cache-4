25|$|The use of {{effective}} communication among patients and healthcare professionals {{is critical for}} achieving a patient's optimal health outcome. However, according to the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, ineffective communication has the opposite effect as it can lead <b>to</b> <b>patient</b> harm.

Use {{of effective}} communication can aid {{in the prevention of}} adverse events, whereas ineffective communication can contribute to these incidences. If ineffective communication contributes to an adverse event, then better and more effective communication skills must be applied in response to achieve optimal outcomes for the patient's safety. There are different modes in which healthcare professionals can work to optimize the safety of patients which include both verbal and nonverbal communication, as well as the effective use of appropriate communication technologies.|$|E

40|$|Given {{that one}} of the main roles of an NHS library is the {{provision}} of access and training to health information for NHS staff and that health librarians are skilled in accessing, using and to some extent understanding health care information, to some it may seem a logical step for NHS libraries {{to be involved in the}} provision of health information <b>to</b> <b>patients.</b> This may not necessarily mean opening up the library <b>to</b> <b>patients,</b> but supporting other NHS staff to provide information <b>to</b> <b>patients.</b> However there are also issues about duplication, appropriateness and implementation that should be taken into consideration when examining the role of the NHS library in providing information for patient care.

Although most doctors believe that errors should be disclosed <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> when they occur, in reality, most doctors and institutions do not disclose such mishaps <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> and their families.

Analysis of contextualized information delivery events across these milestones revealed three factors affecting information delivery and patients’ perception of information delivery. These factors are: temporalities in a patient's care process, invisibility of ED work <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> and a patient’s expectation and health literacy. My study shows how these factors affect information availability, and the time and content of information delivered <b>to</b> <b>patients.</b> The findings reflect on when and what information is appropriate to be delivered <b>to</b> <b>patients,</b> and how <b>to</b> design patient-centric technologies for information delivery to be appropriate {{with regards to the}} time, content and format of information delivery...|$|R
