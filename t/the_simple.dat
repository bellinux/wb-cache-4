5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk is known as <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, {{and is based on}} a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.|$|E
