5|$|As {{fighting}} raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. Strong Vincent of V Corps had {{a precarious}} hold on Little Round Top, an important hill {{at the extreme}} left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, had realized {{the importance of this}} position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the 20th Maine, ordered by Col. Joshua L.

40|$|This {{research}} {{comes as}} a response to the paucity of discussion on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> of retirement. In consideration of the relationship between work and retirement, this study examines what a feminist perspective on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> of work can contribute to the androcentric conception of retirement. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> of work is shaped by many forces, most particularly by the ideology of motherhood and the sexual division of labour. Together, these factors have ensured that women and men experience both paid and unpaid work in quantitatively and qualitatively different manners. While the construction of retirement has been around the largely male experience of fulltime, uninterrupted, paid work, women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> of work have been rendered invisible in which of the retirement discourse. By applying a feminist perspective on women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> of work, this study has been able to explore the concept of retirement with womens 2 ̆ 7 experience of work and later life at the centre of the discussion. This was made possible through using a feminist review of literature on women and work and the construction of retirement. This study also uses case studies of older women to add to the discussion of the concept of reitrement. This is a discussion which is particularly important for women, as they are the predominant survivors into retirement, and as they often experience paid and unpaid work- and thus retirement - differently from men. My personal research journal is included in this thesis in an attempt to show both the personal and public process of feminist research, and to give the reader an insight into the decisions I made during the research process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} one of {{the ways}} to improve student 2 ̆ 7 s writing ability. Having good competence of grammar is not merely in line with writing competence. Above all, creativity, knowledge and experiences are considered to be very important aspects in process of writing. Thus, incorporating concrete student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> will help students integrate prior experience and facilitate students learning abstract concept. By doing so, student can generalize notion of the topic they are going to write. Metaphor shows the way in incorporating student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> into vivid and meaningful words. Metaphor is a bridge for the interaction between the initial state and course of experiences factor. The way covers gathering student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences,</b> formulating metaphorical expression, expressing the meaning, peer review and grammar correction. In conclusion, metaphor gives opportunity for students to optimize their strength and makes use their experiences to write creatively. Metaphor also makes learners focus on the form of language.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the property and the relationship between chronic hepatitis patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> of Cognition-Recognition-Behavior through the method of experience-based analysis, which was developed {{on the basis of the}} Documentary Coding Method. The study also evaluated the efficacy of the analytical method. Methods: A set of Cognition (C) - Recognition(R) -Behavior (B) was extracted from patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> in order to implement the experience-based analysis after specifying the rules of framework that sorts the experiences and criteria of cause and effect relationships. Results: The step-by-step fourth-order analysis revealed that the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> included not only their reading on their cognition initiated from the incident, but also their behavior, and their evaluation for their behavior. Moreover, a shift in experience was taking place in a form of causal chain as a result of changes in situation. Though some symptoms at the early stage of chronic hepatitis, such as fatigue, physical weariness, and itchiness led to a strong sense of suspicion and anxiety, they were not interpreted as <<disease<<, thus no coping behaviors were taken. However, the coping behaviors for the <<disease<< were observed as soon as the patients came to understand their <<disease<< as a result of <<Jaundice<< diagnosis. Conclusion: Experience-bases analysis requires a framework which enables analysts to read into patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> in order to understand its meaning. The analytical method depicted in this study was found to be effective. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Vaginal birth after Caesarean section (VBAC) is a {{relevant}} question {{for a large}} number of women due to the internationally rising Caesarean section (CS) rate. There {{is a great deal of}} research based on quantitative studies but few qualitative studies about women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences.</b> Method: A metasynthesis based on the interpretative meta ethnography method was conducted. The inclusion criterion was peer-review qualitative articles from different disciplines about women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> of VBAC. Eleven articles were checked for quality, and eight articles were included in the synthesis. Results: The included studies were from Australia (four), UK (three), and US (one), and studied women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> in relation to different aspects of VBAC; decision-making whether to give birth vaginally, the influence of health professionals on decision-making, reason for trying a vaginal birth, experiences when choosing VBAC, experiences of giving birth vaginally, and giving birth with CS when preferring VBAC. The main results are presented with the metaphor groping through the fog; for the women the issue of VBAC is like being in a fog, where decision-making and information from the health care system and professionals, both during pregnancy and the birth, is unclear and contrasting. The results are further presented with four themes: ` to be involved in decision about mode of delivery is difficult but important, ?` vaginal birth has several positive aspects mainly described by women, ?` vaginal birth after CS is a risky project, ? and ` own strong responsibility for giving birth vaginally 2 ̆ 7. Conclusion: In order to promote VBAC, more studies are needed from different maternity settings and countries about women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences.</b> Women need evidence-based information not only about the risks involved but also positive aspects of VBA...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiences}} of men regarding the abortion decision were explored. Priorresearch examining men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> with abortion is scanty, and has notspecifically addressed men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experience</b> with decision-making regardingabortion. To address this {{gap in the}} research, a qualitative approach was usedto explore various aspects of men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> regarding the abortion decision. Fourteen male participants were interviewed at a medical clinic in Phoenix onthe day their partners had an abortion. A semi-structured interview protocol wasused. Interview data were reduced using a coding procedure, and themes weredeveloped. A conceptual structure for the themes was developed that outlinedrelationships between the themes. Two independent readers reviewed theaccuracy of the coding and validated the identified themes. Results found twomajor themes under the overarching theme of ambivalence: one, men experience ambivalent feelings about the abortion decision, and two, they usevarious processes to decrease this ambivalence. Under the first major theme,there are two subthemes: men experience emotional conflict and men experience conflict regarding power in the decision. Under the second majortheme, there are four subthemes, which correspond to four different processesmen use to decrease their ambivalence: using cognitive mechanisms, focusingon their partner, focusing on external factors, and seeking reassurance fromothers. Results expand on prior research by identifying ambivalence as adifferent conceptual framework for understanding men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>experiences</b> with the abortion decision. An additional contribution {{of this research is}} the identification of several processes men use to decrease their ambivalence. The implications for clinicians are addressed. Clinicians should assist men in clarifying their ambivalence regarding their feelings and their power in the decision, appropriately assess men 2 ̆ 7 s use of processes to decrease their ambivalence and their function in the overall decision-making process, and maintain an awareness of the relationship between and the intra- and inter-personal processes of the abortion decision...|$|R
