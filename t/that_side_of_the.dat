5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play on <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on {{one side or the}} other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road on <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials on <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E

5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, most cricketers {{considered}} it unsportsmanlike to bowl {{the ball at}} the leg stump or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by {{the early years of}} the 20th century, some bowlers—usually slow or medium-paced—used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed on <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903—04 and Frank Foster in 1911—12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in county cricket.|$|E
5|$|The citadel {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the citadel of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level {{as the rest of the}} city, a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra. The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the citadel. The location of the river also offered protection against attack from <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citadel. The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the citadel. Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E

50|$|In trees, {{the roots}} {{normally}} grow outward to {{about three times}} the branch spread. Only half of a trees root system occurs between the trunk and <b>the</b> circumference <b>of</b> its canopy. Roots on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a tree normally supply the foliage on <b>that</b> same <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree. Thus when roots on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a tree are injured, the branches and leaves on <b>that</b> same <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree may die or wilt. For some trees however, such as the maple family, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> a root injury may show itself anywhere in the tree canopy.|$|R

He came to the United States on the Marine Marlin, and recruited a number of orphans to come and learn in his Yeshiva on the boat ride to the United States.

25|$|Simply put, leg theory {{involves}} concentrating {{the bowling}} attack {{at or near}} the line of leg stump. This {{may or may not be}} accompanied by a concentration of fielders on the leg side. The line of attack aims to cramp the batsman, making him play the ball with the bat close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the off side. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{portions}} of the range are over 60 million years old, with volcanics and a forearc basin as the primary mountain building processes responsible for the range. It {{is part of the}} larger grouping known as the Pacific Coast Ranges that extends over much of the western edge of North America from California to Alaska. The range creates a rain shadow effect for the Willamette Valley that lies to the east of the mountains, creating a more stable climate and significantly less rain than the coastal region of the state. To the west where the range over-shadows the Oregon Coast, the range causes more precipitation to fall on <b>that</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, contributing to the numerous rivers that flow to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
