5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial disputes, the League {{also tried to}} intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in <b>this</b> <b>latter</b> area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, <b>this</b> <b>latter</b> {{argument}} has been fortified by {{the theory of}} connectionism.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits in their current homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> theory may explain the subspecies' phenotypic diversity.|$|E
5|$|Wain's Hotel, 310 Princes St (Category I). Built in 1879 to {{a design}} by Mason & Wales, Wain's Hotel remains Dunedin's grandest hotel building, and {{reflects}} the opulence which followed the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s. The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance façade remains largely intact. <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled spandrels {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may have purchased that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{points to}} a deeper {{understanding}} of reciprocity as the outcome of social learning which takes place between two players of the Centipede. The experimental design consists of a Trust Game followed by a Centipede Game, as <b>this</b> <b>latter's</b> environment of strategic interaction is a sort of multi-stage Trust Game and the former a one-stage Trust Game. Results indicate that the level of cooperation is sensitive to the pay-off structure (this effect being stronger when players are aware of the opponents' social preferences), that heterogeneous pairs are more cooperative, and that sefish subjects modify their behavior whenever they perceive that to trust their partners is both possible and worthwhile...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns {{can be used to}} identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read sets.

A smaller population occurs about 70 kilometres (45mi) further east at Toolinna Cove; when surveyed in August 1991, this locality had around 350 plants. <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> population represents the easternmost limit of the western Banksia species; east of Toolinna Cove no Banksia species occurs for over 900 kilometres (550mi).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although <b>this</b> <b>latter</b> species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters identify it more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{his work}} as a lawyer, Alexander Rutherford was {{involved}} in a number of business enterprises. He was President of the Edmonton Mortgage Corporation, and Vice President and solicitor of the Great Western Garment Company. <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> enterprise, which Rutherford co-founded, was a great success: established in 1911 with eight seamstresses, it had quadrupled in size within a year.

It was acquired by Levi Strauss & Co. in 1961, but continued to manufacture garments in Edmonton until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1938, Soeman {{published}} two further novels, Kasih Tersesat (Lost Love; serialized in Pandji Poestaka in 1932) and Teboesan Darah (Blood Payment; {{published in}} Doenia Pengalaman in 1939). <b>This</b> <b>latter</b> novel marked {{the return of}} Sir Joon, who had featured in several other detective stories by other authors. Soeman also published thirty-five short stories and poems, mostly in the magazine Pandji Poestaka but also in Pedoman Masjarakat and Poedjangga Baroe. Seven of Soeman's Pandji Poestaka stories were compiled in Kawan Bergeloet (Playmate), together with five original stories.

5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, now up to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat <b>this</b> <b>latter</b> problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925.

By the middle of 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect back to the old routing. The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E
