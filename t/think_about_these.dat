500|$|The Pomegranates second review {{came from}} Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the University of Tasmania, who praises Greenwood's research, {{theoretical}} approach {{and style of}} writing. He notes that her [...] "truly ground breaking" [...] approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had [...] "fascinated and thrilled" [...] him, asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection Being Changed by Jean-Guy Goulet and David E. Young. Noting that Magic, Witchcraft and the Otherworld was [...] "sometimes provocative", he disagrees with some of Greenwood's conclusions, but highlights that her arguments had made him <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> issues [...] "in much sharper focus." ...|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? What do you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E

Although the series only aired for one and a half seasons, examining and understanding the images of the tabloid journalists in "Dirt" is necessary because the relationship between the public and real-life tabloid journalists is hostile and angry. While a fraction of what the public <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> journalists comes from real-life experiences with tabloid publications and journalists, part of what the public <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> journalists comes from the images they see on television programs like "Dirt" [...] images that ultimately reinforce the tabloid journalist as corrupt, unfair, unethical, and amoral.

30|$|In Malmö, {{we interviewed}} an {{official}} at the Environmental Office working on the city’s overarching environmental goals in cooperation with Gatukontoret, which is responsible for Malmö’s green vehicle strategy. It is the energy company in Malmö and the city parking company that own the charging stations. She says that it is the energy company’s responsibility to inform the public of any associated risks; it is not the rescue services or the municipality that is responsible. She thinks that people are afraid just because new, unknown technology is involved. She says that energy companies are supposed to inform the public of any associated risks; this is not the role of the rescue services or the municipality.” We do not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> safety when it comes to EVs or the environment.

6000|$|It is remarkable, {{in looking}} back, to notice to what an extent {{this and other}} {{survivals}} of scholastic realism arrested or, at any rate, impeded the application of sound scientific principles to the investigation of biological phenomena. When I was beginning to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> matters, the scientific world was occasionally agitated by discussions respecting {{the nature of the}} [...] "species" [...] and [...] "genera" [...] of Naturalists, of a different order from the disputes of a later time. I think most were agreed that a [...] "species" [...] was something which existed objectively, somehow or other, and had been created by a Divine fiat. As to the objective reality of genera, there was a good deal of difference of opinion. On the other hand, there were a few who could see no objective reality in anything but individuals, and looked upon both species and genera as hypostatised universals. As for myself, I seem to have unconsciously emulated William of Occam, inasmuch as almost the first public discourse I ever ventured upon, dealt with [...] "Animal Individuality," [...] and its tendency was to fight the Nominalist battle even in that quarter.|$|E

'What a {{delightful}} scene, that of the Countess of Coalbrookdale! You're doing real good, I do believe, by making people <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> things more seriously, you know. As poor dear Mr. Le Breton would have said, you've got an ethical purpose--isn't that the word?--underlying even your comic operas. By the way, do you ever see the Le Bretons now? Poor souls, I hear they're doing very badly. The elder brother, Herbert Le Breton--horrid wretch!--he's here to-night; going to marry that pretty Miss Faucit, they say; daughter of old Mr. Faucit, the candle-maker--no, not candles, soap I think it is--but it doesn't matter twopence nowadays, does it? Well, as I was saying, you're doing {{a great deal of}} good with characters like this Countess of Coalbrookdale.

6000|$|My friends, {{these may}} seem deep words to some--doubtless they are, {{for they are}} {{the words of the}} Bible--so deep that plain, unlearned people can make no use of them, and draw no lesson from them. I do not think so. I think it is of endless use and endless {{importance}} to you how you think about Christ; and, therefore, how you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> forty days between our Lord's resurrection and ascension. You may think of our Lord in two ways. You may think of Him as having gone very far away, millions of millions of miles into the sky, and not to return till the last day,-- and then, I do not say that you will weep and lament. There are not many who have that notion about our Lord, and yet love Him enough to weep and lament at the thought of His having gone away. But your religion, when it wakes up in you, will be a melancholy and terrifying one. I say, when it wakes up in you--for you will be tempted continually to let it go to sleep. There will come over you the feeling--God forgive us, does it not come over us all but too often?--Christ is far away. Does He see me? [...] Does He hear me? Will He find me out? Does it matter very much what I say and do now, provided I make my peace with Him before I die? And so will come over you not merely a carelessness about religious duties, about prayer, reading, church-going, but worse still, a carelessness about right and wrong. You will be in danger of caring little about controlling your passions, about speaking the truth, about being just and merciful to your fellow-men. And then, when your conscience wakes you up at times, and cries, Prepare to meet thy God! you will be terrified and anxious at the thought of judgment, and shrink from the thought of Christ's seeing you. My friends, that is a fearful state, though a very common one. What is it but a foretaste of that dreadful terror in which those who would not see in Christ their Lord and Saviour will call on the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them, from Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb? ...|$|E
