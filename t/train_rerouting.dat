40|$|The {{real time}} railway traffic {{management}} seeks {{for the train}} routing and scheduling that minimize delays after an unexpected event perturbs the operations. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear programming formulation for tackling this problem, modeling the infrastructure in terms of track-circuits, which are the basic components for train detection. This formulation considers all possible alternatives for <b>train</b> <b>rerouting</b> in the infrastructure and all rescheduling alternatives for trains along these routes. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, we present the first formulation that solves this problem to optimality. We tested the proposed formulation on real perturbation instances representing traffic in a control area including the Lille Flandres station (France), achieving very good performance in terms of computation time...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} train conflict detection and resolution, which is dealt every day by traffic controllers to adapt the timetable to delays and other unpredictable events occurring in real-time. We describe a number of algorithmic improvements implemented in the real-time traffic management system ROMA (Railway traffic Optimization by Means of Alternative graphs), achieved by incorporating effective rescheduling algorithms and local rerouting strategies in a tabu search scheme. We alternate a fast heuristic and a truncated branch and bound algorithm for computing train schedules within a short computation time, and investigate the effectiveness of using different neighborhood structures for <b>train</b> <b>rerouting.</b> The computational experiments are based on practical size instances from a dispatching area of the Dutch railway network and include complex disturbances with multiple late trains and blocked tracks. Several small instances are solved to optimality in order to compare the heuristic solutions with the optimum. For small instances, the new tabu search algorithms find optimal solutions. For large instances, the solutions generated by the new algorithms after 20 Â s of computation are {{up to more than}} 15 % better than those achieved within 180 Â s by the previous version of ROMA.

50|$|The CNE {{had been}} forced to build the {{parallel}} Poughkeepsie and Connecticut Railroad in the late 1880s due to the Poughkeepsie and Eastern's refusal to sell. In 1910 the P&C was abandoned between Salt Point and Pine Plains, with <b>trains</b> <b>rerouted</b> over the P&E. With the 1925 abandonment of the P&E from Ancram Lead Mines northeast to Boston Corners, the P&C served as the sole route east of Pine Plains (it too was closed in 1932). Abandonment came in 1938 {{to the rest of the}} P&E.|$|R

50|$|On July 1, 1918, {{the entire}} IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line was completed. 3 <b>trains</b> were <b>rerouted</b> south of 42nd Street from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line {{to this new}} line. They now made all stops to South Ferry.|$|R
50|$|When the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line {{was first}} built, the tracks from Ploshchad Revolyutsii {{extended}} westward to Aleksandrovsky Sad rather than Arbatskaya. When the westward {{extension of the}} line was completed in 1953, <b>trains</b> were <b>rerouted</b> through the new segment.|$|R

50|$|In September 1941, Adolf Hitler, at {{the urging}} of Reinhard Heydrich and Joseph Goebbels, had decreed the {{deportation}} of German Jews to the east.

500|$|The 96th Street {{station is}} served by the Q <b>train</b> (<b>rerouted</b> from its former {{terminus}} of Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard) at all times, {{as well as some}} N trains during rush hours; it is the northern terminus of both services. It has two tracks and an island platform. The station is built so that it is more wide open than most other underground subway stations in the system. Its design was likened to a Washington Metro station by Dr. Michael Horodniceanu, President of MTA Capital Construction. The platform is approximately 49 feet (15m) below ground, making the station the shallowest of the three Phase 1 stations. The platform for the 96th Street station, like the other Second Avenue Subway stations, is [...] wide.|$|R
50|$|The track {{connection}} at Country Life Press to the West Hempstead Branch was removed on August 19, 1960, {{and on this}} same date the tracks were cut back from Country Life Press to {{the west side of}} the Franklin Avenue crossing. The remaining tracks north of West Hempstead at Hempstead Avenue were removed some time between 1967 and 1969. Freight <b>trains</b> and non-revenue <b>rerouting</b> <b>trains</b> continued down these portions up until their closure. The rights-of-way, remain intact.|$|R
25|$|Nearly all lines use {{the core}} route {{through the city}} centre in the underground, {{creating}} a bottle-neck responsible for long and increasingly frequent delays from even the smallest disruptions.

The project cost $82 million. Many [...] <b>trains</b> were <b>rerouted</b> via the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, while the [...] <b>trains</b> were <b>rerouted</b> to the 137th Street-City College station on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line.

25|$|An {{attempt was}} made to extend express service further north on January 14, 1955, when {{alternate}} rush trains ran express between 137th and 96th Streets in the peak direction.
