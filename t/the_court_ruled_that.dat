5|$|Reed v. Reed (1971), which {{struck down}} an Idaho probate law favoring men, {{was the first}} {{decision}} in which <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> arbitrary gender discrimination violated the Equal Protection Clause.

Reed and Craig later served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws discriminating by gender.|$|E

In League of United Latin American Citizens v.

Nintendo Co., Ltd.). They were ordered to pay fines and all of Nintendo's legal costs from the lawsuit. That, along with <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> there was simply no likelihood of people confusing Donkey Kong with King Kong, caused Universal to lose the case and the subsequent appeal.|$|R

Classic (1941), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> primary elections were {{an essential part of the}} electoral process, undermining the reasoning in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>ruled</b> <b>that</b> black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E
