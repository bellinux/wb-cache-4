Use of the term has since rapidly spread around the world—particularly among academics—to identify moving image and sound work by visual artists, a popular development which arose comparatively recently in the mid- to late-twentieth century.|$|R

50|$|The Toaster {{hardware}} requires {{very stable}} input signals, and therefore {{is often used}} along with a separate video sync <b>time-base</b> corrector to stabilize the video sources. Third-party low-cost <b>time-base</b> correctors (TBCs) specifically designed {{to work with the}} Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard ISA bus cards, taking advantage of the typically unused Bridgeboard slots. The cards do not use the Bridgeboard to communicate, but simply as a convenient power supply and physical location.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{measurement}} {{instruments of}} time and frequency have the stages of arming time, <b>time-base</b> time, processing time and may then re-trigger the arming. The arming time is {{from the time the}} arming is triggered to when the start event occurs on the start channel. The <b>time-base</b> then ensures that minimum amount of time goes prior to accepting an event on the stop channel as the stop event. The number of events and time elapsed between the start event and stop event is recorded and presented during the processing time. When the processing occurs (also known as the dwell time) the instrument is usually unable to do another measurement. After the processing has occurred, an instrument in continuous mode triggers the arm circuit again. The time between the stop event and the following start event becomes dead time during which the signal is not being observed. Such dead time introduces systematic measurement biases, which needs to be compensated for in order to get proper results. For such measurement systems will the time T denote the time between the adjacent start events (and thus measurements) while [...] denote the <b>time-base</b> length, i.e. the nominal length between the start and stop event of any measurement.|$|E

50|$|Only {{one type}} of {{artillery}} round other than the W48 was produced in large numbers. It was the W33 nuclear warhead for use in an 8 in artillery shell. About 2,000 of these warheads were produced from 1957 to 1965. Each XM422 projectile was 940 mm long, it had a projectile weight of 243 pounds. XM422 were fitted with a triple-deck mechanical <b>time-base</b> fuze. They were to be fired from a standard eight-inch howitzer, if {{the use of this}} weapon had ever been called for.|$|E
5000|$|Copying {{video from}} one VCR to another VCR {{displayed}} compromised playback reliability, and exponential levels of head-switching noise, chroma smearing and noise, compounded with every generation. These technical challenges motivated videotape editors and engineers to plan work around minimising generational degradation. Use of a <b>time-base</b> corrector (TBC) or [...] "dub" [...] cable were methods of minimising multi-generational quality loss. The TBC regenerates the sync tip {{portion of the}} video signal, improving playback reliability. The dub, demodulated (or [...] "demod") cable was a multi-conductor cable that circumvented a portion of video circuitry, minimising amplification noise.|$|E

50|$|Dead time {{effects on}} {{measurements}} {{have such an}} impact on the produced result that much study of the field have been done in order to quantify its properties properly. The introduction of zero dead-time counters removed the need for this analysis. A zero dead-time counter has the property that the stop-event of one measurement is also being used as the start-event of the following event. Such counters creates a series of event and time timestamp pairs, one for each channel spaced by the <b>time-base.</b> Such measurements have also proved useful in order forms of time-series analysis.|$|E

Compass-IGSO1 is the second satellite of the Compass navigation system with an optical synchronization link.

5000|$|The MC-8 {{was based}} on a {{prototype}} developed by Canadian Ralph Dyck, a composer and technologist who did research and development for Roland. [...] Roland switched to the then brand new Intel 8080A 8-bit microprocessor and increased the RAM from 512 bytes to 16KB, allowing storage of over 5,300 notes, which could be entered via the calculator keyboard (the preferred method) or recorded in real-time (not so easy). Backup was via cassette and could take 45 minutes to an hour for a three- or four-minute piece of music to back up and verify. The memory was volatile, so a loss of power meant complete loss of data. All parameters were variable so the scale and <b>time-base</b> could be assigned number values to suit the needs of the piece being programmed. This made the machine extremely versatile but somewhat unfriendly to approach for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The {{gas stream}} (frequently ambient air) {{passes through a}} filter {{material}} which traps the suspended particulates, creating a deposit of increasing density. A light beam projected through the deposit is attenuated by those particles which are absorbing (‘black’) rather than scattering (‘white’). Measurements are made at successive regular time intervals. The increase in attenuation from one measurement to the next {{is proportional to the}} increase in the density of optically absorbing material on the filter: which, in turn, is proportional to the concentration of the material in the sampled air stream. The sample is collected as a spot on a roll of filter tape. When the density of the deposit spot reaches a pre-set limit, the tape advances to a fresh spot and the measurements continue. Measurement of the sample gas flow rate and knowledge of the instrument’s optical and mechanical characteristics permit a calculation of the average concentration of absorbing particles in the gas stream during the sampling period. Aethalometers may operate on <b>time-base</b> periods as rapid as 1 second, providing quasi-real-time data. Comparison of aethalometer data with other physical and chemical analyses allows the output to be expressed as a concentration of black carbon.|$|E
