5|$|Early in 1943 Petrov {{notified}} the People's Commissar of Armaments Dmitriy Ustinov {{about the new}} project. On 13 April Ustinov informed Petrov that the State Committee of Defence had requested for five of the new guns {{to be sent to}} the <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> on 1 May. On 5 May, two pieces were received for trials; two days later, on 7 May the gun was recommended for adoption, and on 8 August 1943 it was officially adopted as the 152mm howitzer M1943. One and a half months later, the first series production D-1 howitzers were delivered to the Red Army representatives.|$|E
5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E

25|$|Stevens became {{directly}} {{affiliated with}} the ABCFM's work among the Chinese on 7 July 1835 or March 1836. After the Chinese convert and missionary Liang Fa began distributing tracts with Qu Ya'ang to the candidates attempting the prefectural and provincial examinations, Stevens joined Liang in missionizing at the Guangzhou <b>testing</b> <b>grounds.</b> He is generally {{believed to have been}} the foreign missionary who gave Hong Xiuquan his copy of Liang Fa's 1832 Good Words to Admonish the Age after his second failed imperial examination in Guangzhou. Its ideas were later adapted by Hong in his preaching of an idiosyncratic form of Christianity which led to the Taiping Rebellion of the 1850s and '60s.|$|E
25|$|The Inca state drew its taxes {{through both}} tax in kind and corvée labor drawn from {{lineages}} and administered through a bureaucracy composed largely of local nobility. The corvée labor force {{was used for}} military operations as well as public works projects, such as roads, aqueducts, and storage buildings known as tampu and qollqa. There were parallel institutions of lineage-based colonies known as mitmaqkuna, which produced goods for the state and provided strategic security in newly acquired areas, and yanakuna, which were retainers with labor obligations to higher members of the state. Lands belonging to the Sapa Inca, the state church, and to panaqas (lineages descending from individual Sapa Incas according {{to the principle of}} split inheritance) were often vertical arrayed to access a variety of resources. Indeed, it has been widely suggested that the terraces at Moray were <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> for determining which crops would grow under what conditions in order to more efficiently exploit ecozones. The terraces were apparently constructed so that different temperatures and humidities could be achieved through the creation of microclimates, and therefore produce different kinds of crops.|$|E
25|$|ELINT {{operations}} {{aimed at}} China: After China tested its first nuclear weapons on 16 October 1964, at Lop Nur, Xinjiang, India and the USA {{shared a common}} fear about the nuclear capabilities of China. Owing to the extreme remoteness of Chinese <b>testing</b> <b>grounds,</b> strict secrecy surrounding the Chinese nuclear programme, and the extreme difficulty that an Indian or American would have passing themselves off as Chinese, {{it was almost impossible}} to carry out any HUMINT operation. So, the CIA in the late 1960s decided to launch an ELINT operation along with RAW and ARC to track China's nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches. The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to Nanda Devi involved celebrated Indian climber M S Kohli who along with operatives of Special Frontier Force and the CIA – most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran STOL pilot – was to place a permanent ELINT device, a transceiver powered by a plutonium battery, that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China. The monitoring device was near successfully implanted on Nanda Devi, when an avalanche forced a hasty withdrawal. Later, a subsequent mountain operation to retrieve or replant the device was aborted when {{it was found that the}} device was lost. Recent reports indicate that radiation traces from this device have been discovered in sediment below the mountain. However, the actual data is not conclusive.|$|E

500|$|The {{observatory}} {{was for a}} time home to two automated supernova surveys. The Berkeley Automated Supernova Search, led by Saul Perlmutter, {{who went}} on to head the Supernova Cosmology Project, used the [...] telescope at Leuschner to scan the skies nightly for supernova. The Leuschner Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) began in 1992, as the Berkeley Automated Imaging Telescope (BAIT) also searched for supernova, in this case under Alex Filippenko. Both were used as <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> for automated searches at other sites, with BAIT eventually being succeeded by the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope located at Lick Observatory. While LOSS operated at Leuschner, it discovered SN 1992bt, SN 1993G, SN 1993R, SN 1993X, SN 1993Z, SN 1994D, and SN 1994ae.|$|E

500|$|Between July 1936 and April 1939, {{during the}} Spanish Civil War, the two {{opposing}} armies received {{large quantities of}} tanks from foreign powers. [...] Spain's Second Republic received tanks from the Soviet Union, {{many of which were}} captured by the Nationalists and pressed into service against their former masters, while the Nationalists were aided by the Germans and Italians. [...] The Spanish Civil War, although the <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> for the nations which would ultimately take part in World War II, proved inconclusive with regard to the proof of mechanized warfare. [...] Despite attempts by Soviet, German and Italian advisers and soldiers to use newly devised mechanized theories, the lack of quality crews and the tanks, and the insufficient number of tanks provided bad impressions on the usefulness of tanks on their own.|$|E
500|$|During August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B {{tanks were}} {{captured}} by the Soviets near Sandomierz, and were soon moved to the <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> at Kubinka. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension {{of one of the}} tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 1015km. The 8.8 cm KwK 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its [...] "colleague", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Analysis of the Tiger Ausf B armour plate showed an absence of molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), Some have said it gives the armour low malleability.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prototype}} {{was secretly}} constructed at Leytonstone and transported by {{night to the}} <b>testing</b> <b>grounds</b> at Westward Ho!, Devon. However, once there the secrecy surrounding the project broke down, as the beach chosen as a test site was also a popular destination for holidaymakers and from the first test on 7 September 1943 onwards, every trial was witnessed by large citizen audiences despite the DMWD's warnings concerning {{the safety of the}} weapon. Since nothing remotely resembling the Panjandrum had ever been constructed before, the trials began with trepidation [...] only a handful of cordite rockets were attached to the wheels, and the payload was simulated by an equivalent weight of sand. When Shute gave the signal, the rockets were ignited and the Panjandrum catapulted itself forward, out of the landing craft used as a launchpad, and a fair distance up the beach before a number of the rockets on the right wheel failed and the weapon careened off course. Several further attempts were made with more and more rockets, but on every occasion the Panjandrum lost control before reaching the end of the beach.|$|E
