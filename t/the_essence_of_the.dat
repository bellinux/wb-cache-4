5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried to retain <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world and rebuild these elements. The game's story {{was written by}} British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} stage of development, the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games.

5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E

Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive, the film was screened as a midnight movie, received positive notice, and developed a cult following. In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD, and in 2008, the film was colorized.|$|E
5|$|In September 1523, Leo Jud, Zwingli's {{closest friend}} and {{colleague}} and pastor of St. Peterskirche, publicly called {{for the removal of}} statues of saints and other icons.

Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Zurich, the dioceses of Chur and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.|$|E

Distillation was believed by medieval scholars to produce <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid being purified, and the term aqua vitae ("water of life") was used as a generic term for all kinds of distillates. The early use of various distillates, alcoholic or not, was varied, but it was primarily culinary or medicinal; grape syrup mixed with sugar and spices was prescribed for a variety of ailments, and rose water was used as a perfume and cooking ingredient and for hand washing. Alcoholic distillates were also occasionally used to create dazzling, fire-breathing entremets (a type of entertainment dish after a course) by soaking a piece of cotton in spirits. It would then be placed in the mouth of the stuffed, cooked and occasionally redressed animals, and lit just before presenting the creation.|$|E

The editor-in-chief assigned five writers to work on the series, including the novelist Willa Cather as the principal author. The book was kept out of print from early in its life by the Christian Science church, which bought the original manuscript. It was republished in 1971 by Baker Book House when its copyright expired, and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the Confrontation is {{generally}} split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands of no more than platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops.

5|$|Wasting Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to capture <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated editing techniques. The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, {{and most of the}} lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.|$|E

Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access {{to the top of the}} island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a bonus stage called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos - creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother - is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.|$|E
