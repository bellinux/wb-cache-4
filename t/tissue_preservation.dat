25|$|The depositional {{environment}} {{of the majority of}} Burgess-Shale-type assemblages is outer shelf, deeper water. The Emu Bay Shale in contrast, appears to represent deposition in restricted basins on the inner shelf, indicating that soft <b>tissue</b> <b>preservation</b> occurred in a range of environmental settings during the Cambrian. Some Emu Bay fossils display extensive mineralization of soft tissues, most often of blocky apatite or fibrous calcium carbonate, including the oldest phosphatized muscle tissue – along with records from Sirius Passet in Greenland, the first thus far reported from the Cambrian.

2500|$|In 1949, bull semen was cryopreserved for {{the first}} time by a team of {{scientists}} led by Christopher Polge. [...] This led to a much wider use of cryopreservation today, with many organs, tissues and cells routinely stored at low temperatures. Large organs such as hearts are usually stored and transported, for short times only, at cool but not freezing temperatures for transplantation. Cell suspensions (like blood and semen) and thin tissue sections can sometimes be stored almost indefinitely in liquid nitrogen temperature (cryopreservation). Human sperm, eggs, and embryos are routinely stored in fertility research and treatments. Controlled-rate and slow freezing are well established techniques pioneered in the early 1970s which enabled the first human embryo frozen birth (Zoe Leyland) in 1984. Since then, machines that freeze biological samples using programmable steps, or controlled rates, have been used all over the world for human, animal, and cell biology – 'freezing down' a sample to better preserve it for eventual thawing, before it is deep frozen, or cryopreserved, in liquid nitrogen. Such machines are used for freezing oocytes, skin, blood products, embryo, sperm, stem cells, and general <b>tissue</b> <b>preservation</b> in hospitals, veterinary practices, and research labs. The number of live births from 'slow frozen' embryos is some 300,000 to 400,000 or 20% of the estimated 3 million in vitro fertilized births. Dr Christopher Chen, Australia, reported the world’s first pregnancy using slow-frozen oocytes from a British controlled-rate freezer in 1986.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the solid-state fermentation with Rhizopus oryzae CCT 7560 of rice bran for the enrichment of proteins and the antioxidant compounds in the fermented biomass. Fermentation was performed in tray bioreactors at 30 ºC for 120 h. Protein extraction was done at alkaline pH, followed by precipitation with acetone. Phenolic compounds were extracted with cold methanol. The maximum protein was recovered from after 120 h (26. 6 %). The content of total phenolic compounds increased during the fermentation and was maximum after 96 h, which inhibited the DPPH radical by 87 %.

40|$|Mushrooms are {{consider}} as a nutritional and health beneficial product. Three most cultivated mushrooms worldwide are Agaricus bisporus, Lentinus edodes and Pleurotus spp. Mushrooms are highly perishable. They tend to lose quality after harvest, {{mainly because of}} their high respiration rate {{and the fact that}} they have no barrier to protect them from water loss. Mushrooms’ shelf-life is limited to a few days under normal refrigeration conditions, which is a constraint on the distribution and marketing of fresh product, making extension of mushroom’s shelf life a constant quest. Modified atmosphere packaging provides an affordable packaging system that partly avoids enzymatic browning, fermentation and other biochemical processes by maintaining a controlled gas atmosphere. However, modified atmosphere packaging conditions should be carefully designed.

40|$|This {{report on}} a male head {{revealed}} biologic rhythms, as gleaned from hydrogen isotope ratios in hair, consistent with a South-American origin and Atomic Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon dating (AMS) compatible with the last pre-Hispanic period (1418 – 1491 AD, 95. 4 % probability). Biopsies showed exceptionally well-preserved tissues. The hair contained high levels of toxic elements (lead, arsenic and mercury) incompatible with life. There was no evidence for lead deposition in bone consistent with post-mortem accumulation of this toxic element in the hair. We propose that the high content of metals in hair {{was the result of}} metabolic activity of bacteria leading to metal complexation in extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS).

40|$|Melatonin, {{due to its}} {{pleiotropic}} effects {{plays an}} important role improving tolerance to stresses. Plants increase endogenous melatonin synthesis when faced with harsh environments as well as exogenously-applied melatonin limits stress injuries. Presented work demonstrated that single melatonin application into the seeds during pre-sowing priming improved oxidative stress tolerance of growing seedlings exposed to paraquat (PQ). PQ is a powerful herbicide which blocks the process of photosynthesis under light conditions due to free radicals excess production, when O 2 is rapidly converted to O 2 •- and subsequently to other ROS. The parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo, Rfd, ΦPSII, qP and NPQ) in all variants of pea leaves (derived from control non treated seeds – C, and those hydroprimed with water – H, and hydroprimed with melatonin water solution 50 or 200 μM – H-MEL 50 and H-MEL 200, respectively) were analysed as a tool for photosynthetic efficacy testing. Moreover stability of the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls a, b, and carotenoids) was also monitored under oxidative stress conditions. The results suggest that melatonin applied into the seed significantly enhances oxidative stress tolerance in growing seedlings. This beneficial effect was reflected in reduced accumulation of O 2 •- in leaf <b>tissues,</b> <b>preservation</b> of photosynthetic pigments, improved functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus and higher water content in the tissues during PQ-mediated stress. Our findings provide evidence for the physiological role of this molecule and serve as a platform for its possible applications in agricultural or related areas of research...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{concerned}} with the ancient Egyptian mummification method; nevertheless, little effort {{has been made to}} explore it experimentally. The goal {{of this study is to}} apply evidence-based diagnostic criteria and state-of-the art methodology in order to improve knowledge on soft <b>tissues</b> <b>preservation</b> and postmortem alterations. Two human lower limbs (LL) from a female donor were (1) “naturally” mummified by dry heat and (2) artificially in natron. At specific time intervals a macroscopic and radiological examination of the LL was performed and skin and muscle samples were taken for histological and biomolecular analysis. Temperature, humidity, pH, and weight of the LL were systematically measured. The mummification by dry heat was stopped after 7 days due to unexpected lack of mummification progress. The mummification in natron was completed successfully after 208 days. The humidity, the external temperature, and the pH were proven with Pearson correlation and principal component analysis as important factors for the mummification process. The steady removal of water from the tissues through the natron has prevented the putrefaction. This is also evident in the absence of bacteria or fungi through the microbiological analysis. The histological analysis revealed very good preservation of the skin and the muscle tissues. In the muscular sample certain degree of structural disintegration can be seen, particularly affecting the epimysium whilst in the skin samples the epidermis, especially the stratum corneum, is mostly affected.

In this study, fragments from normal placentae were incubated at 37 degrees C either immediately after delivery or after preservation at 4 degrees C in a HEPES-buffered solution or in a Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 culture medium. Protein, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), human placental lactogen (HPL) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) contents within preserved explants {{were similar to those}} within freshly delivered ones. In contrast, HCG and HPL amounts released during incubation of preserved tissue were lower than with freshly delivered tissue. Differences were significant only during the first 3 h of incubation. Hormone releases were similarly Ca(2 +) -stimulated, and Co(2 +) - and low temperature-inhibited in preserved and freshly delivered <b>tissues.</b> After <b>preservation,</b> LDH leakage was also reduced. Furthermore, before and after 37 degrees C incubation during 6 h, preserved tissue was morphologically indistinguishable from freshly delivered tissue and showed neither higher incidence of DNA fragmentation, nor elevated caspase- 3 activity, both of which are markers of apoptosis. This study validates an original, useful and rapid method to preserve placental <b>tissue.</b> Consequently, this <b>preservation</b> model may facilitate the study of physiological processes regulating placental hormone secretion in normal and pathological conditions.
