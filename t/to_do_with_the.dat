5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe he had something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> incident. Maddy tries {{to find out what}} is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} the present paper may appear at first sight {{somewhat}} paradoxical. It may be asked what has the transit of Venus <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Meteorology? <b>The</b> answer is—the transit of Venus is the best means of procuring the sun's true distance from the earth, and the sun has everything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Meteorology. <b>The</b> relation of these subjects to each other appears an interesting question for discussion...|$|R

5|$|Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen {{created his}} own version of the TV show with a collie named Bessy in 1954. Apart from the fact that his comic strip starred the same dog breed with a similar name it had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> series overall, since the comic was a western comic.|$|E
5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis.

5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had less <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game itself and more with {{being a part of}} the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series.

5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have had anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} over what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> money generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour. Laliberté wanted {{to use it to}} expand and start a second show while Caron wanted the money to be saved, with a portion going back to the National Circus School. An agreement was never met and Caron, along with a large number of artists loyal to him, departed. This stalled plans that year to start a new touring show.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E

5|$|In a deleted scene set {{after the}} end of the episode, Walter talks with the first patient Joseph Slater, who wonders why he was chosen to have a piece of Walter's brain.

5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby. The book was initially called Gumby's Arthur Adams Specials, but was eventually published with a sticker covering Adams' {{name on the}} cover, effectively renaming the book Gumby's Spring Specials. According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, this was done on Adams' request, who wanted nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E
5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
