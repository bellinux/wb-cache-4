5|$|Both {{the opening}} and ending credits {{sequences}} incorporate shots of St Michael and All Angels Church in Hughenden Valley, Buckinghamshire, which doubles as the parish church of Father Unwin. In the opening sequence, a zoom shot establishes a backdrop of fields while the series title slowly fills <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>in</b> a motion that draws inspiration from traditional images of angels descending from Heaven.|$|E

5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns. The film performed {{better in the}} French and West German markets, {{largely due to the}} presence of Trintignant and Kinski. It has been reported that during a screening of the film in Sicily, one audience member fired a gun at <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> anger over the film's ending.|$|E
5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Atari {{released}} several computer versions {{under the}} Atarisoft label. All {{of the computer}} ports had the cement factory level, {{while most of the}} console versions did not. None of the home versions of Donkey Kong had all of the intermissions or animations from the arcade game. Some have Donkey Kong {{on the left side of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> the barrel level (like he is in the arcade game) and others have him on the right side.|$|E

5|$|In this falling block puzzle game, the player's {{objective}} is to destroy the viruses populating the on-screen playing field by using colored capsules that are tossed into the field by Mario, who assumes {{the role of a}} doctor. The player manipulates each capsule as it falls, with the goal being to align similar colors which removes the viruses. The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> each level.|$|E
5|$|Kneale {{credited}} {{the director}} Rudolph Cartier with bringing to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> Quatermass II, with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style {{that had not}} been seen in British television drama beforehand. Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third Quatermass serial, Quatermass and the Pit, in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as Anna Karenina (1961), Cross of Iron (1961) and Lee Oswald — Assassin (1966). He continued directing for television until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>In</b> 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E

5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher {{had a habit of}} signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped from the top of <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest first {{appeared}} on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> 1905. Charles Urban filmed the opening storm sequence of Herbert Beerbohm Tree's version at Her Majesty's Theatre for a -minute flicker, whose individual frames were hand-tinted, long before the invention of colour film. In 1908, Percy Stowe directed a Tempest running a little over ten minutes, which is now {{a part of the}} British Film Institute's compilation Silent Shakespeare. Much of its action takes place on Prospero's island before the storm which opens Shakespeare's play. At least two other silent versions, one from 1911 by Edwin Thanhouser, are known to have existed, but have been lost. The plot was adapted for the Western Yellow Sky, directed by William A. Wellman, in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The group come {{together}} for a dance routine on a rooftop with a backdrop of dark grey skies and strikes of lightning. All four group members are also seen pacing through a dark city wearing figure hugging outfits. The video {{draws to a close}} when the man who the group have built an unhealthy fixation to is seen tied to a chair as the group walks towards him, before the words 'To Be Continued' appear on <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> <b>In</b> an interview with Owen Myers of Popjustice, Jesy Nelson said the music video will be continued on their 2013 DNA Tour.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} paddles {{along the}} screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The player loses a life if Kirby hits {{the edge of}} the screen. Each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear. The ten different block types vary in durability and points value. A well-timed hit of the paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks. Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> the least amount of time. The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames, such as air hockey, where the player can earn extra lives. The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid. Some enemies contain bonus items. Each stage ends in a boss fight.|$|E

5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a magnifying glass to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
5|$|In April 1953, at the {{invitation}} of the French government, she traveled to the Cannes Film Festival, where she met Pierre Galante, an executive editor for the French journal Paris Match. Following a long-distance courtship and the requisite nine-month residency requirement, deHavilland and Galante married on April 12, 1955, in the village of Yvoy-le-Marron, and settled together in a three-story house near the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris' 16th arrondissement. That same year, she returned to <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> Terence Young's period drama That Lady (1955), about a Spanish princess and her unrequited love for King Philip II of Spain, whose respect she earned in her youth after losing an eye in a sword fight defending his honor. According to Tony Thomas, the film uses authentic Spanish locations effectively, but suffers from a convoluted plot and excessive dialogue, and while deHavilland delivered a warm and elegant performance as Ana de Mendoza, the film was disappointing. Following her appearances in the romantic melodrama Not as a Stranger (1955) and The Ambassador's Daughter (1956)neither of which were successful at the box officedeHavilland gave birth to her second child, Gisèle Galante, on July 18, 1956.|$|E
5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> <b>in</b> the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury.
