5|$|Myst Online was {{generally}} well received by critics. The game has average critic scores of 77% and 83% at aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively.

5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions that range from securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults. Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a Nod media manipulation, which convinces <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> the GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to a cut in GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of Nod in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

60|$|Kant {{pictures}} to himself {{the universe as}} once an infinite expansion of formless and diffused matter. At one point of this he supposes a single centre of attraction set up; and, by strict deductions from admitted dynamical principles, shows how this must result {{in the development of}} a prodigious central body, surrounded by systems of solar and planetary worlds in all stages of development. In vivid language he depicts the great world-maelstrom, widening the margins of its prodigious eddy in the slow progress of millions of ages, gradually reclaiming more and more of the molecular waste, and converting chaos into cosmos. But what is gained at the margin is lost in the centre; the attractions of the central systems bring their constituents together, which then, by the heat evolved, are converted once more into molecular chaos. Thus <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>that</b> are, lie between the ruins of <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>that</b> have been, and the chaotic materials of <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>that</b> shall be; and in spite of all waste and destruction, Cosmos is extending his borders at the expense of Chaos.|$|R

His time of 20.27seconds in the 200m final was the fastest indoor run in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> year. His fastest of the season came at the Reebok invitational and his time of 20.25seconds placed him as the 13th fastest runner in 2006. He completed a 200m NCAA Championship double by taking the outdoor title, and he also finished as runner-up in the 100m, second to Xavier Carter.|$|E

The arrival of close friend, Steve McManaman, from Real Madrid gave Fowler hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership from their time at Liverpool, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries, alleged excesses as well as named and shamed in a sex scandal covered by the News of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 Shaw {{invested}} £1,000 for a one-fifth {{share in}} the Webbs' new publishing venture, a socialist weekly magazine called the New Statesman, which appeared in April 1913.

5|$|In 1921, Mitchell first {{demonstrated}} to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> battleships and other gun dependent vessels could be sunk by aircraft loaded with heavy bombs.

Although the Navy had placed strict rules on the bombing exercise, Mitchell and his men violated the rules and attacked the battleship head on, which caused the vessel to sink in a mere 22 minutes. Although downplayed at the time this would have a dramatic effect on U.S. policy, leading to increased research and development for aircraft.|$|E
