5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, the US offered <b>the</b> <b>Honest</b> John missile. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John {{missiles}} with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments, the 24th at Nienburg (and later Paderborn), the 39th at Sennelager, and the 50th at Menden, with two batteries each. In addition, each regiment had two batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers (later replaced by M110 howitzers) with W33 nuclear warheads. A British nuclear artillery round project was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met {{the same fate}} on 10 August 1962. <b>The</b> <b>Honest</b> Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. One of <b>the</b> <b>Honest</b> John regiments, the 50th Missile Regiment, Royal Artillery, was then re-equipped with the Lance missile, with its W70 nuclear warhead. The W48 was acquired for the 155mm M109 howitzers. Both it and the W33 would remain in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the Davy Crockett, but had decided against it by February 1962.|$|E

5|$|Kings was {{recorded}} by the Opies as common in eastern England. The English Dialect Dictionary recorded much {{the same in the}} nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 Dialect of Northamptonshire. Queens is recorded as used in the kings area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to restart the game. Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker's <b>The</b> <b>Honest</b> Whore, Part One (II,i), which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced <b>the</b> <b>Honest</b> Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, President Bush {{signed into}} law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal {{legislation}} to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.

Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections, and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Project E {{nuclear warheads}} {{were also used}} on the sixty Thor Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles which were {{operated}} by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under Project Emily. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its Corporal missiles in 1958. The United States subsequently offered <b>the</b> <b>Honest</b> John missile as an interim replacement, and it remained in service until 1977, when it was in turn superseded by the Lance missile. Eight-inch and 155mm nuclear artillery rounds were also acquired under Project E. A maritime version of Project E known as Project N provided nuclear depth bombs used by the RAF Coastal Command. The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Tourneur's primary {{dramatic}} work is The Atheist's Tragedy, or <b>The</b> <b>Honest</b> Man's Revenge {{which was published}} in 1611. A case has been made by Johan Gerritsen that Tourneur {{is the author of the}} first act of <b>The</b> <b>Honest</b> Man's Fortune (1613), a play from the Beaumont & Fletcher canon usually attributed to John Fletcher, Philip Massinger and Nathan Field. In addition there is a lost play, The Nobleman, and the lost Arraignment of London written with Robert Daborne. The Revenger's Tragedy (1607), which was once attributed to Tourneur, has now been securely reassigned to Thomas Middleton.|$|E
