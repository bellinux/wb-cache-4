5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{practical}} problems, mostly arising from <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> imprecise nature of an automatic gun's firing, the great (and varying) {{velocity of the}} blades of a spinning propeller, and the very high speed at which any gear synchronizing the two has to operate.|$|E
25|$|When photographing or {{shooting}} {{video of}} shy animals which are easily disturbed, {{it is more}} likely to be successful if there is only one diver potentially disturbing the subjects. The disturbance can also be reduced by buddy diving on rebreathers, which cuts down on bubble noise, but at the cost of increased risk due to <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> higher number of failure modes characteristic of rebreathers. It is not clear which system has the lower overall risk.|$|E

25|$|The proton-lithium-6, helium-3-lithium, and helium-3-helium-3 {{reaction}} {{rates are}} not particularly high in a thermal plasma. When treated as a chain, however, they offer the possibility of enhanced reactivity due to a non-thermal distribution. The product 3He from the Proton-lithium-6 reaction could participate in the second reaction before thermalizing, and the product p from helium-3-lithium could participate in the former before thermalizing. Unfortunately, detailed analyses do not show sufficient reactivity enhancement to overcome <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> low cross section.|$|E
25|$|Players of rugby league {{all need}} to be {{particularly}} physically fit and tough because of the game's fast pace and the expansive size of the playing-field as well as <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> rough physical contact involved. Depending on their exact role or position, a player's size, strength and/or speed can provide different advantages (or disadvantages). Effective teamwork is also extremely important as all players must work in concert with each other {{if they are to}} be successful.|$|E
25|$|The key {{disadvantages}} {{include the}} relatively low rotational speed with the consequential higher torque and hence higher cost of the drive train, <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> lower power coefficient, the 360-degree rotation of the aerofoil within the wind flow during each cycle and hence the highly dynamic loading on the blade, the pulsating torque generated by some rotor designs on the drive train, {{and the difficulty of}} modelling the wind flow accurately and hence the challenges of analysing and designing the rotor prior to fabricating a prototype.|$|E

Karamanlis attempted to defuse the tension between Greece and Turkey, which were {{on the brink of}} war over the Cyprus crisis, through the diplomatic route. Two successive conferences in Geneva, where the Greek government was represented by George Mavros, failed to avert a full-scale invasion and occupation of 37 percent of Cyprus by Turkey on 14 August 1974.|$|E
25|$|In Catholic teachings, {{the object}} of the devotion to the Heart of Mary is her {{physical}} Heart that burned so intensely with love for God. Because of <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> close relationship of Mary and Jesus in the Catholic teachings on salvation, the Heart of Mary is associated with the Heart of Jesus. The Sacred Heart is viewed as the source of God's boundless love and charity, while the devotion to the Immaculate Heart stresses the nature of Mary's love and concern for all who call upon her.|$|E
25|$|The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher {{will not}} cover cases of harm to persons within the {{premises}} where <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> dangerous activity is carried out, {{for the rule}} requires escape of the thing, which causes harm from the premises. The new rule makes no distinction between the persons within the premises where the enterprise is operating or and persons outside the premises because escape of the thing causing harm from the premises is not {{a necessary condition for}} the applicability of the rule. Further, the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, though strict {{in the sense that it}} is not dependent on any negligence on the part of the defendant and in this respect similar to the new rule, is not absolute as it is subject to many exceptions but the new rule in Mehta’s case is not only strict but absolute and is subject to no exception.|$|E

50|$|The BWO is {{a voltage}} tunable oscillator, whose voltage tuning rate is {{directly}} related to the propagation characteristics of the circuit.

25|$|The Green Sun Princes' {{disadvantage}} is {{that they}} are few in number; only 50 infernal essences are controlled by the Yozis, and they do not yet have the ability to corrupt further Solar Essences as the Deathlords can. On the other hand, the Infernals have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation. The Infernals are closely tied to their Yozi masters, and experience Urge, psychological motivations towards missions set by their patrons. Unlike Abyssals, Infernals rarely regret their state, and instead revel in their mission to overthrow the upstart gods and return creation to its original rulers. It is implied, however, that due to <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> poor treatment by the Yozis (being unable to fully comprehend things outside of their domain and thus with little respect for anything else) and obvious insanity, the vast majority will grow dissatisfied and go rogue, using their link to Primordial power to mutate into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision they possess.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{example is}} the Soviet S4M pistol, {{designed}} to be used expressly {{for the purpose of}} assassination. It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet {{in such a way that}} ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away. Due to the politically devastating nature inherent in this design, the S4M was kept highly secret. Information on the pistol was not known by western governments until well after the end of the Cold War.|$|E

500|$|Games journalists regard Undead Nightmare {{as among}} the best {{expansion}}s. Kotaku wrote of its originality, despite the trite zombie theme, and added that the expansion functioned best when Rockstar used the game's silly pretense to exercise their sense of humor, with undead versions of normal animals, and new mythical creatures. The reviewer related the game's level of entertainment to it being the first Rockstar release in years to [...] "wholeheartedly embrace <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> madcap nature of open world games". Undead Nightmare took a good title and [...] "put it over the top", as USgamer put it. Hardcore Gamer cited the expansion {{as an example of}} downloadable content that would have never fit in the main game but instead let the developers explore other ideas.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were generally}} well received. Bramwell called the graphics [...] "unchanged and increasingly antiquated" [...] and criticized {{the presence of}} [...] "sharp, angular character models, eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when the player is trying to turn round and ends up banging into a curb". Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and praised the realism they brought to <b>the</b> <b>inherently</b> fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that [...] "THUGs cityscapes are incredibly well designed" [...] and singled out the GameCube version of Underground as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels [...] "big and beautiful". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism. Perry appreciated the [...] "hilariously hurtful" [...] injury sounds and the extensive song list. By contrast, IGN's Craig Harris praised the graphics of the Game Boy Advance version but was more mixed on the soundtrack.|$|E
