Reports finding that all 87 agencies participating in the Data Cell had established telework policies and 73 percent of the policies met the Telework Act Requirements. More than 684,000 federal employees were deemed eligible to telework, this represents approximately 32 percent of all federal employees. More than 144,000 federal employees had written <b>teleworking</b> agreements with their agencies. 27 percent of teleworkers worked remotely three or more days per week. In addition to the findings, the reports examine <b>teleworking</b> at the Department of Defense. According to the report, {{there are more than}} 793,000 employees in the DoD and of those employees, 134,477 were deemed eligible for <b>teleworking.</b> Overall, the federal government seems to have embraced <b>teleworking</b> and is attempting to create more remote working opportunities for employees. In closing, the report listed several ways that the government could make more jobs available through telework. Suggestions include using telework as a tool to retain employees at or near retirement age and using telework to expand hiring of highly trained disabled veterans.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>telework</b> was {{introduced}} in the 1970 's as a way to substitute telecommunications technology for the commute to work (Nilles 1998). <b>Telework</b> promised many environmental, family, employee, and business benefits. With continued advances in information and communication technology, there were great expectations for the growth of <b>telework</b> and its benefits. While the practice of <b>telework</b> has grown, in many respects the high expectations have not been fulfilled.

40|$|This study investigates how nation-level {{cultural}} values (‘individualism’ and ‘collectivism’) and intra-organizational task control mechanisms influence {{the level of}} organizations’ use of formal <b>telework</b> practices. Employing a multi-level analysis on survey data (2009 / 10), including 1577 organizations within 18 nations, we found that ‘high use of formal <b>telework</b> practices in organizations’ was more likely when: (1) organizations operated in nations characterized by strong national values; and when they employed (2) ‘hard’ indirect controls (i. e. individual performance-related pay and 360 º performance-evaluations). High <b>telework</b> use was less likely when organizations employed direct controls (i. e. higher proportions of managers) and ‘soft’ indirect controls (i. e. higher proportions of professionals). ‘Low use of formal <b>telework</b> practices’ was more likely when organizations employed ‘soft’ indirect controls. Our findings suggest that national {{cultural values}} can function as ‘soft’ indirect controls to mitigate the ‘telework risk’ of high levels of <b>telework</b> practices. Internal ‘soft’ task controls only sufficed for managing low levels of <b>telework</b> practices.

Variations of this motto include: [...] "Work is something we DO, not a place that we GO" [...] and [...] "Work is what we do, not where we are." [...] Telecommuting has been adopted by a range of businesses, governments and not-for-profit organizations. Organizations may use telecommuting to reduce costs (telecommuting employees do not require an office or cubicle, a space which has to be rented or purchased, provided with lighting and climate control, etc.). Some organizations adopt telecommuting to improve workers' quality of life, as <b>teleworking</b> typically reduces commuting time and time stuck in traffic jams. As well, <b>teleworking</b> may make it easier for workers to balance their work responsibilities with family roles (e.g., caring for children or elderly parents). Some organizations adopt <b>teleworking</b> for environmental reasons, as telework can reduce congestion and air pollution, as it can reduce the number of cars on the roads.|$|E

Based on the Job Demands-Resources Model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007) and the professional isolation literature (e. g., Golden, Vega, & Dino, 2008), we developed and tested a set of hypotheses.
