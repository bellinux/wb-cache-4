5|$|Human {{rights in}} Turkey {{have been the}} subject of some {{controversy}} and international condemnation. Between 1998 and 2008 the European Court of Human Rights made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding the right to life, and freedom from torture. Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy. Turkey's human rights record continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> obstacle to future membership of the EU.|$|E

There are also other significant sources of funding from the group, including funding from sympathisers based in the US and other countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the animated film, Yellow Submarine was not generally considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> release. Issued two months after The Beatles, {{it was one of}} the few Beatles releases that failed to top the charts in either the United Kingdom or the United States, peaking instead at number 3 and number 2, respectively. In Canada, Yellow Submarine topped the RPM national albums chart for two weeks, ending the White Album's 12-week run at number 1. On America's Billboard Top LPs chart, it was kept from the top by the same album.|$|E

5|$|Now {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{turning point}} {{in the history of the}} Hollywood blockbuster, the film was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) on limited release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film grossed over $817.4 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996, and briefly, the second highest-grossing film worldwide of all time behind 1993's Jurassic Park. , it ranks 55th on the list of highest-grossing films, and was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-1990s. The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing. A sequel, , was released on June 24, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Only three {{fatalities}} were reported, one direct {{death in}} Florida from high surf, one indirect {{death in a}} traffic accident in North Carolina and a second indirect death due to a fall in Nova Scotia. Damage is estimated at around $70million, mostly in North Carolina {{but also in the}} Bahamas and Nova Scotia and on the Florida coast. While the storm was initially estimated to have caused as much as $1billion in damages, that number was determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> overestimate.|$|E
5|$|The total {{casualty}} {{figures for}} North Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, Hmong, and Thai units are unknown. According to official Vietnamese history, the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion lost one soldier killed and two wounded in their fight for Lima Site 85. Against those losses, the Vietnamese claimed {{a total of}} 42 Hmong and Thai soldiers were killed, {{and a number of}} others were wounded. A large number of weapons were captured by the NVA, including one 105mm howitzer, one 85mm artillery piece, four recoilless rifles, four heavy mortars, nine heavy machine guns, and vast amounts of ammunition. The North Vietnamese victory proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> one, as they had succeeded in knocking out a major asset of the USAF, which had inflicted heavy damages to North Vietnam's limited industrial infrastructures.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Kupres was {{the first}} {{concrete}} result of the renewed BosniakCroat alliance in the Bosnian War, and the advance to Kupres {{was the first}} military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement. Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further advantages for them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the Split–Livno–Kupres–Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition, especially after the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994. The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia. Finally, {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when Operation Winter '94 was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent capture of Bihać by the VRS. The battle is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War.|$|E
5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds, calling them croton finches because of their liking for the croton bush, but the pet trade appears not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor at present.|$|E
