5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a}} new constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> over their weapons. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who {{was telling the truth}} was difficult and remains so.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas Iscariot was {{a disciple}} of Jesus. Before the Last Supper, Judas {{went to the}} chief priests and agreed <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> over Jesus in {{exchange}} for 30 silver coins.

In January 563, however, the new prefect of Africa, John Rogathinus, refused <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> over {{the money and}} had Cutzinas murdered, prompting an uprising from the latter's children.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E

On their way out of the parking lot, their car is pulled over by police Chief Wiggum, along with Eddie and Lou. They administer a breathalyser test to Homer, which he fails. He is arrested, his license is revoked, and he must attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, {{bringing}} with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} send an envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on {{the terms of a}} peace. Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Austria {{called for}} Prussia <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> over {{administration}} of Schleswig-Holstein, which had {{until that point}} been jointly administered by the two powers, to the Duke of Augustenberg. Prussia refused, and Otto von Bismarck sent troops into Austrian-administered Holstein. This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with Hesse siding with the Austrians, technically making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E

The letter was found to ask for such details as salary and other films that were downloaded, as well as punitive damages, which are illegal to seek under Australian law.|$|E
5|$|In October 97 these {{tensions}} {{came to a}} {{head when}} the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage. He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians. Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius, Domitian's former chamberlain, were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E

Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man as hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Confederacy.|$|E
