5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Combs</b> {{family was}} one of the oldest European {{families}} in the United States. John Combs, the family patriarch, arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in 1619, and in 1775 Benjamin John Combs came westward from Virginia into Clark County, Kentucky. He was followed into Kentucky in 1790 by two of his brothers, including Jack Combs, Bert Combs' great-grandfather.|$|E
5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E
5|$|During {{the primary}} campaign, Chandler focused his attacks on <b>the</b> <b>Combs</b> {{administration}} {{rather than the}} inexperienced Breathitt. A seasoned campaigner, he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during <b>the</b> <b>Combs</b> administration. Breathitt struck back with accusations that, as a senator, Chandler had {{voted in favor of}} declaring war on Japan during World War II, but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter. He further charged that Chandler's son-in-law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government. The younger Breathitt, thirty-eight years old when the campaign began, adapted well to the relatively new medium of television, while the aging Chandler did not. Breathitt won the primary by more than 60,000 votes and carried {{all but one of the}} state's congressional districts. Chandler's running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt's running mate, John B. Breckinridge, showing that the defeat was not so much a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler. This campaign ended Chandler's political career.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> Holden <b>comb</b> was {{suited for}} <b>the</b> <b>combing</b> of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are {{fed into the}} machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by <b>the</b> lashing action of the filling heads. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle rotates, <b>the</b> fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by <b>the</b> keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle carries <b>the</b> remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur <b>combs,</b> <b>the</b> drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final <b>combing</b> by removing <b>the</b> long fibres from the pins of <b>the</b> nacteur <b>comb</b> and <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle; <b>the</b> short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in <b>the</b> nacteur <b>combs</b> are transferred to <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E
25|$|V. crabro {{prefers to}} build nests in dark places, usually hollow tree trunks. After {{the site has}} been chosen, the queen lays eggs in <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> inside the nest. The workers dispose of any eggs that are not from their queen directly, due to worker policing. Based on {{laboratory}} data, the egg-laying rate is roughly 2.31 eggs per day. However, in this same lab nest, the cell construction rate was only 1.63 cells per day.|$|E
25|$|P. sericea is {{a species}} that is {{historically}} and culturally significant to the Pankararé Indians who live in northwest Brazil. They have developed a folk taxonomy of many social bees and wasps that inhabit the area. Polybia sericea is classified as a fierce wasp {{that is likely to}} bite more than once. This classification contrasts with other findings that describe this species as docile, and not aggressive unless provoked. The Pankararé often roast <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> of Polybia sericea larvae, and then extract them to be eaten alone or mixed with manioc flour. In addition, they use this species in their healing practices. A bath of smoke from burning the nests of Polybia sericea is used to treat evil eye and stroke.|$|E
40|$|We explore downsampling {{of optical}} {{frequency}} combs {{by way of}} pulse gating for efficient spectral broadening and f- 2 f interferometry. We downsample a 250 MHz repetition-rate comb to 25 MHz, thereby enabling detection of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> carrier-envelope offset frequency. Pulse gating can both increase timing jitter of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> pulse train and induce spurious frequency offsets of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> spectrum. To investigate these effects, we characterize the phase-noise spectrum of <b>the</b> downsampled <b>comb,</b> determine <b>the</b> effects of timing jitter deliberately imposed on the pulse gate, and demonstrate the null frequency shift of <b>the</b> <b>comb's</b> optical spectrum {{to the level of}} several microhertz...|$|R

25|$|The {{subterranean}} nests provide suitable {{living conditions}} for many arthropods. The most common nest associates are Triphleba lugubris. The highest abundance of T. lugubris is found during late September to mid-October. The females of T. lugubris are typically the first arthropods {{to locate and}} exploit V. pensylvanica colonies under conditions favorable for nest associates. Large numbers of T. lugubris larvae reside {{near the bottom of}} nest between the leaves of nest envelopes. T. lugubris is the only nest associate that contributes to colony decline by destroying pupae in the nests. While the larvae feed on dead yellowjacket brood and adults collected beneath <b>the</b> <b>combs,</b> they also feed on V. pensylvanica pupae. Similarly, yellowjacket pupae have also been found to feed on the larvae and pupae of T. lugubris living in the food source.|$|E
500|$|Reports {{show this}} {{behavior}} in hives in the US in 1918 and 1919. [...] Coined [...] "mystery disease" [...] by some, it eventually became more widely known as [...] "disappearing disease". Oertel, in 1965, reported that hives afflicted with disappearing disease in Louisiana {{had plenty of}} honey in <b>the</b> <b>combs,</b> although few or no bees were present, discrediting reports that attributed the disappearances to lack of food.|$|E
500|$|There {{are eight}} rows of combs that run from {{near the mouth}} to the {{opposite}} end, and are spaced evenly round the body. The [...] "combs" [...] beat in a metachronal rhythm rather {{like that of a}} Mexican wave. From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows, and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows. This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> to the balancers, via water disturbances created by the cilia.|$|E
40|$|Fiber-ring-based optical {{frequency}} comb generators are analyzed {{to understand their}} behavior and limitations. A numerical frequency-domain model is described for studying dispersion and other phase mismatch causing effects in the fiber ring cavity, {{as well as for}} predicting the spectral and temporal evolutions of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> in time. <b>The</b> results from this analysis are verified with experimental measurements. A flat optical comb, with a terahertz span within a 6 -dB power envelope and containing 100 comb lines, with a suppressed central comb line, is demonstrated. <b>The</b> <b>comb</b> shows an excellent coherence dependent on the phase noise from the radio frequency synthesizer that drives <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> generator. Improvement in the error correction loop also enables <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> spacing to be set at precise 12. 5 -MHz intervals without having to adjust the system. Fast frequency switching of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> line spacing is demonstrated for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>comb</b> line spacing,can be switched to any operation frequency with a resolution of 12. 5 MHz between 6 and 12. 5 GHz, as limited only by the microwave circuit used. The switching time is less than 1 s, and the spectral profile of <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> is maintained...|$|R

500|$|On January 3, 1962, Chandler {{opened a}} {{campaign}} headquarters in Frankfort, announcing {{his bid for}} an unprecedented third term as governor with the slogan [...] "ABC [...] in '63". His opponent in the primary was Edward T. [...] "Ned" [...] Breathitt, Jr., the choice of outgoing Governor Bert Combs. Chandler reverted to his familiar campaign themes, charging <b>the</b> <b>Combs</b> administration with wasting state funds {{in the construction of}} a floral clock at the state capitol and denouncing Combs for re-instituting the state sales tax. However, he found it very difficult to adapt to campaigning via television, an increasingly important medium, and his attacks mostly fell flat.|$|E
500|$|With {{little but}} Combs' {{inexperience}} to run against, Chandler portrayed Combs as a pawn of former governors Clements and Wetherby, whom he derisively nicknamed [...] "Clementine" [...] and [...] "Wetherbine". He accused both administrations of wasteful spending, specifically attacking {{the construction of}} the Kentucky Turnpike and Freedom Hall as unnecessary expenditures. Some of Chandler's attacks were more personal in nature; he charged that when Clements was governor, he spent $20,000 ($ in [...] dollars) on a new rug for his office, and that Wetherby had used African mahogany to panel his office, instead of [...] "good, honest Kentucky wood". Though receipts later showed that carpeting for the entire first floor of the capitol had cost only $2,700 and that Wetherby's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a Kentucky contractor, Chandler's charges remained effective at keeping <b>the</b> <b>Combs</b> campaign on the defensive.|$|E
500|$|Ctenophores {{used to be}} {{regarded}} as [...] "dead ends" [...] in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.|$|E

50|$|The {{most popular}} method of {{harvesting}} honey from a top-bar hive is by cutting <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> from <b>the</b> top-bar, crushing <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> and straining <b>the</b> honey. This results in honey {{with a higher}} pollen content than honey that is extracted by flinging out without crushing <b>the</b> <b>comb.</b> Top-bar hive comb can be extracted by flinging motion, e.g. in a hobbyist or commercial rotary extractor, {{but it can be}} problematic, because (a) if no foundation was used, <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> will break more easily during rotary movement, (b) top-bar hives combs have irregular or non-standard sizes that do not fit into commercially available extractors, (c) if <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> is not uniformly flat, {{it may be difficult to}} uncap the cells, which is required for rotary extraction, and (d) not all rotary extractors have cages or mesh to prevent loose pieces of comb from falling into the drum.|$|R

60|$|The Spanish fowl {{offers a}} more curious case; the male has an immense comb, {{but some of}} the {{successive}} variations, by the accumulation of which it was acquired, appear to have been transferred to the female; for she has a comb many times larger than that of the females of the parent species. But <b>the</b> <b>comb</b> of <b>the</b> female differs in one respect from that of the male, for it is apt to lop over; and within a recent period it has been ordered by the fancy that this should always be the case, and success has quickly followed the order.

2500|$|Jean Ritchie {{was born}} to Abigail (née Hall) and Balis W. Ritchie of Viper, an unincorporated {{community}} in Perry County in the Cumberland Mountains of south eastern Kentucky.

In 1917, the great collector Cecil Sharp collected songs from Jean's older sisters Una and May. Many of the Ritchies attended the Hindman Settlement School, a folk school, where people were encouraged to cherish their own backgrounds and where Sharp also found many of his songs. Jean's father Balis had printed up a book of old songs entitled Lovers' Melodies, and music making was an important activity in the Ritchie home.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, the German yellowjacket (V. germanica) first {{appeared}} in Ohio, and has now become the dominant species over the eastern yellowjacket. It is bold and [...] aggressive, and can sting repeatedly and painfully. It will mark aggressors, and will pursue them. It is often confused with Polistes dominula, an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities—not necessarily underground—with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on {{the source of the}} wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within <b>the</b> <b>combs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Consisting of a papery {{envelope}} covering several horizontal combs, R. romandi nests {{are referred}} to as ‘paper bag nests’ [...] because they are made of plant fibers glued together with saliva yo form a dry papery substance. [...] The nests can be up to one meter long and are usually off the ground in trees or eaves of buildings. To begin building a nest, a number of wasps gather at the nesting site, and begin building several combs simultaneously. This simultaneous building leads to semi-spiral shape within the nest because irregular connections are made when <b>the</b> <b>combs</b> are connected at their growth fronts. The envelope is either constructed after the construction of the first few combs or during that process; the timing of envelope construction depends on swarm size, and nest location. More combs are then added, and the envelope is then completed to cover all combs. The number of entrance holes depends on nest size. R. romandi never builds double sided combs and the number of cells in each comb varies. The cells are all of similar size, indicating that size dimorphism is insignificant in R. romandi colonies.|$|E
