5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the optimistic}} Australian {{assessments}} of Viet Cong capability, {{rather than having}} left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians {{in order to preserve}} their strength. Regardless, D445 Battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while the headquarters of the Viet Cong 5th Division was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains, with its fighting formations widely dispersed. The Viet Cong 275th Regiment was reported to have moved north to War Zone D for retraining and refitting, and the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich to replace it in the north-east of the province, and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile, casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. Unsure of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move,</b> the Viet Cong 5th Division adopted a cautious posture, with only the 1st Battalion, 275th Regiment remaining in the May Tao mountains while the 274th Regiment dispersed east of Route 2 {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E

25|$|If X plays corner opening move (best {{move for}} them), O should take center, {{and then an}} edge, forcing X to block in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> This will stop any forks from happening. When both X and O are perfect players and X chooses to start by marking a corner, O takes the center, and X takes the corner {{opposite}} the original. In that case, O is free to choose any edge as its second move. However, if X is not a perfect player and has played a corner and then an edge, O should not play the opposite edge as its second move, because then X is not forced to block in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> and can fork.|$|E

25|$|It is {{impossible}} to force checkmate with a king and two knights, although checkmate positions are possible (see the first diagram). In the second diagram, if Black plays 1... Ka8? White can checkmate with 2. Nbc7#, but Black can play 1... Kc8 and escape the threat. The defender's task is easy — he simply has to avoid moving into a position in which he can be checkmated on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move,</b> and he always has another move available in such situations.|$|E
25|$|Zugzwang {{most often}} {{occurs in the}} endgame {{when the number of}} pieces, and so the number of {{possible}} moves, is reduced, and the exact move chosen is often critical. The first diagram shows the simplest possible example of zugzwang. If it is White's move, they must either stalemate Black with 1.Kc6 or abandon the pawn, allowing 1...Kxc7 with a draw. If it is Black's move, the only legal move is 1...Kb7, which allows White to win with 2.Kd7 followed by queening the pawn on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> was to India in 1846. Initially the {{regiment}} {{was based in}} Calcutta (Kolkata) and Dinapore, however, in 1848 it moved to the Punjab where, although not directly engaged in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, a second battle honour — PUNJAUB — was awarded. From here {{the regiment}} {{was one of the}} first British units to serve on the North West Frontier and spent 1849–1851 in and around the Kohat Pass area. The governor-general of India, had instructed Sir Colin Campbell to take the 98th on a series of punitive raids against Pathan tribesmen, in order to force them to pay taxes levied by the East India Company, but Campbell refused and was forced to resign and return to England.|$|E

25|$|Clearing is {{when the}} player in {{possession}} of the ball is pressed hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply {{in order to get}} out of a dangerous situation. When opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players high up in the field who are pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot.|$|E
25|$|After {{the massacres}} perpetrated by the Mark I robots, Judge Stich {{was unable to}} bear {{his share of the}} {{responsibility}} for the disaster and he went insane. He was committed to a psychiatric ward, from where he would persistently escape and search the sewers for the rogue Number Five. It was therefore generally assumed that McGruder had learned her lesson and that the project had been discontinued. It suited McGruder to allow people to think so. However, she still authorised the development of Mark IIs, this time under the purview of Tek-Judge Quiggley. After another year of work, Quiggley almost had the improved robots ready for a second field test when Number Five re-emerged from the sewer and began a third campaign of murder. This time Number Five had learned to go to ground after each attack, and all efforts to locate it failed. Taking personal charge of the search, McGruder brought forward the new robots' field test and deployed them on the streets, reasoning (wrongly as it transpired) {{that the best way to}} anticipate <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> of a robot was to use other robots to hunt it.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} {{the military}} garrison in Oporto revolted, formed a provisional governmental junta, and marched on Coimbra {{to defend the}} liberal cause. But the general in command of these troops was indecisive, and Miguel was able to raise his own troops, create a battalion of volunteers and blockade Oporto. In Lagos a similar revolt was attempted, but immediately quashed when the liberal General Saraiva was shot by the Miguelist General Póvoas. On this occasion, João Carlos Saldanha (later Duke of Saldanha) and Pedro de Sousa Holstein (later 1st Duke of Palmela), who had arrived from England on board the British ship Belfast in order to lead constitutional forces, quickly re-embarked, judging the liberal cause lost. The liberal army escaped to deplorable conditions in Galicia where they awaited <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move.</b> In the former regency's court there were few strong supporters of a constitutional monarchy; Princess Isabella Maria was supported by weak-willed ministers or incompetents and was personally too timid {{to stand up to}} Miguel. The liberal elite and their supporters escaped into exile. All of Portugal recognized the sovereignty of the monarch, except the islands of Madeira and Terceira; Madeira was easily subjugated, but Terceira remained faithful to the liberal cause.|$|E
5000|$|Anticipating <b>the</b> <b>next</b> move: Each <b>move</b> {{played in}} a local board determines where <b>the</b> opponent's <b>next</b> <b>move</b> may be played.

Therefore, players are forced to consider the larger game board instead of simply focusing on the local board.|$|R

25|$|Allied codebreakers read much {{enciphered}} German message traffic, {{especially that}} encrypted with the Enigma machine. The Allies' Ultra programme was initially of limited value, {{as it took}} too long {{to get the information}} to the commanders in the field, and at times provided information that was less than helpful. In terms of anticipating <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> the Germans would make, reliance on Ultra sometimes backfired. Part of the reason the initial German attacks in March 1941 were so successful was that Ultra intercepts had informed Wavell that OKW had clearly directed Rommel not to take any offensive action, but to wait until he was further reinforced with the 15th Panzer Division in May. Rommel received this information, but placed more value on his own assessment of the situation. Trusting that the Germans had no intention of taking major action, the British command did not respond until it was too late. Furthermore, Rommel did not generally provide OKW or the Italian Comando Supremo details of his planned operations, for he thought the Italians too prone to leak the information. Thus on 21 January 1942, when Rommel struck out on his second offensive from El Agheila, Commando Supremo was just as surprised to learn of it as the British were. Ultra intercepts provided the British with such information as the name of the new German commander, his time of arrival, and the numbers and condition of the Axis forces, but they might not correctly reveal Rommel's intentions.|$|E
25|$|Today, in the Samoa 'ava ceremony, {{the role}} of the aumaga is a {{comprehensive}} term, but in former times the 'ava makers were a much more select guild. In the preparation of the 'ava for a ceremony the services of a young woman or young man, or one or more young ladies and young men may be utilised. It is customary for the daughters of all chiefs to be taught how to prepare the 'ava. If the person mixing the 'ava is a young woman, it is customary for her to be the virgin daughter of a chief (matai). The 'ava mixer, sits behind the tanoa bowl and thoroughly mixes the 'ava as another member of the aumaga adds water from time to time. As the mixing proceeds, the 'ava mixer from time to time wrings the liquid from the strainer and folding the same into half its usual length passes it to another member of the aumaga standing outside or {{near the edge of the}} house who frees the strainer of the woody particles of the 'ava by several violent flicks. He then quickly passes the strainer back to the mixer who proceeds until all the particles of the dried root are removed. The stylised movements and serious concentration in the making of the 'ava are part of the ritual pattern in the ceremony. The water poured into the bowl as the mixing proceeds is done from either the left or right, not from in front. The action of mixing is one of contracting and expanding the fingers of the two hands as the strainer is slowly worked towards the mixer. When the mixing is completed the rim of the bowl is wiped to remove any water or woody material and the strainer is folded up and placed on the rim of the bowl. The mixer then places both hands on the bowl and sits quietly awaiting <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>move</b> in the ceremony.|$|E
