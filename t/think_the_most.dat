5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>most</b> depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

[...] King wrote, [...] "Following the Hammer films, this becomes, I <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important moment in the post-1960 horror film, signaling a return to an all-out effort to terrify the audience...and a willingness to use any means at hand to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E

5000|$|Bostrom {{identifies}} {{four types}} of existential risk. [...] "Bangs" [...] are sudden catastrophes, which may be accidental or deliberate. He <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely sources of bangs are malicious use of nanotechnology, nuclear war, {{and the possibility that}} the universe is a simulation that will end. [...] "Crunches" [...] are scenarios in which humanity survives but civilization is irreversibly destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> likely causes of this, he believes, are exhaustion of natural resources, a stable global government that prevents technological progress, or dysgenic pressures that lower average intelligence. [...] "Shrieks" [...] are undesirable futures. For example, if a single mind enhances its powers by merging with a computer, it could dominate human civilization. Bostrom believes that this scenario is most likely, followed by flawed superintelligence and a repressive totalitarian regime. [...] "Whimpers" [...] are the gradual decline of human civilization or current values. He <b>thinks</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely cause would be evolution changing moral preference, followed by extraterrestrial invasion.|$|R

2500|$|In August 2010, before Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit {{was set to}} take {{center stage}} at EA's press conference during Gamescom, it was {{announced}} by art director Henry LaBounta that Criterion collaborated with Battlefield creators EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) in building the massive open world of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. Early in November 2010, Patrick Söderlund, Senior Vice President of EA Games Europe, said this of the collaboration: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important thing, when you have two high-quality developers working together, for it to work, {{they need to have}} mutual respect. They need to have that respect, to say ‘Ok, we trust you to do this.’ This was a case where that was so obvious, where the Criterion team had a full trust in the DICE team to do what they were doing, and vice versa." ...|$|E

[...] Ford responded, [...] "I don't know why Mr. Corker keeps bringing up my family[...] [...] [...] It's you and I running for the Senate. It's our ideas, our plans to make the future better for everybody. Let's stick to you and I. And if you come up with a recipe to pick family, say it. Otherwise be quiet and let's run for the Senate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I would have to say that I shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E

2500|$|After harming his own National Football League lineman {{career by}} {{overtraining}} and focusing {{too much on}} weight and bulk, Marv studied Eastern Bloc training methods and was hired by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis as the NFL's first strength-and-conditioning coach. Marv later opened his own athletic research center and applied the techniques to his young son, introducing athletic training before Marinovich could leave the crib and continuing it throughout his childhood and adolescence. Marv saw an opportunity to use techniques, focusing on speed and flexibility, that later {{formed the basis for}} modern core training. During her pregnancy, Trudi used no salt, sugar, alcohol, or tobacco; as a baby, Marinovich was fed only fresh vegetables, fruits, and raw milk. Marv Marinovich commented [...] "Some guys <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important thing in life is their jobs, the stock market, whatever. [...] To me, it was my kids. The question I asked myself was, How well could a kid develop if you provided him with the perfect environment?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sapir (סַפִּיר = in the masoretic text) / Sapphiros (in the Septuagint) - despite {{appearing}} {{to refer to}} Sapphire, Sapphire was essentially unknown before {{the era of the}} Roman Empire and its use in Greek texts is believed to be a mere transliteration of the Hebrew. Once it became more known, it was treated as merely being a form of hyacinth or of jacinth. It is more likely that the term Sapir referred to a mineral of similar colour to Sapphires, and that the name gradually came to refer to the latter mineral, on account of its colour; scholars <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> likely candidate is lapis lazuli, a stone with a deep, ocean-blue colour which was frequently sent as a gift to Akhenaten from Babylon. Theophrastus mentions the stone sapphirus as being [...] "dark" [...] and having the [...] "colour of verdigris," [...] as well as being [...] "speckled as of with gold." [...] By all accounts, his description fits the lapis-lazuli.|$|E
