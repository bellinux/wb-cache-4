On 18 March, 33 P-39s, 92 P-40s and 52 P-400s were on hand. While there were three USAAF pursuit groups in Australia, the 8th, 35th and 49th, Wurtsmith's was the only one considered combat ready. Of the 102 pilots in his group, only Wurtsmith, with 4,800 hours of pursuit time, and his executive officer, Major Donald R. Hutchinson, with 2,600 hours, were veteran pilots. Five others had more than 600 hours and nine had about 15 hours. The remaining 89 pilots had no pursuit <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

25|$|At first, Shui Ta only appears when Shen Teh is in a {{particularly}} desperate situation, but as {{the action of the}} play develops, Shen Teh becomes unable {{to keep up with the}} demands made on her and is overwhelmed by the promises she makes to others. Therefore, she is compelled to call on her cousin's services for longer periods until at last her true personality seems to be consumed by her cousin's severity. Where Shen Teh is soft, compassionate, and vulnerable, Shui Ta is unemotional and pragmatic, even vicious; it seems that only Shui Ta is made to survive in the world in which they live.

25|$|Her Metropolitan Opera debut {{took place}} on 26 November 1961, when she sang Lucia. After a total of 223 {{performances}} {{in a number of}} different operas, her last appearance there was a concert on 12 March 1989. During the 1978–82 period her relationship with the Met severely deteriorated when Sutherland had to decline the role of Constanze in Mozart's Die Entführung aus dem Serail, more than a year before the rehearsals were scheduled to start. The opera house management then declined to stage the operetta The Merry Widow especially for her, as requested; subsequently, she did not perform at the Met during that <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> even though a production of Rossini's Semiramide had also been planned, but later she returned there to sing in other operas.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks earlier}} in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste no <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in {{defeating}} Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests {{that they need to}} come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E

500|$|When {{ambulance}} {{crew members}} Reg Jones and John Saua {{arrived at the}} Samarkand, {{the door to the}} flat was wide open, the gas fire was on, the curtains were drawn, and the apartment was dark. The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: [...] "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [...] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the aspirator... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillow—black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down... We felt his pulse... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{plot and}} {{production}} were praised. For Mellor, [...] "In barely any <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> we'd been told a complete {{story that was}} satisfying, romantic and unexpectedly uplifting." [...] Owen, similarly, argued that the episode [...] "achieved what it wanted to, ending with a fantastic reveal [...] {{and each of the}} storylines were resolved quite nicely", though Lawrence felt that the [...] "twist" [...] involving Janet's ability to lip-read was [...] "obvious". Patrick Mulkern (Radio Times) commended the production, and the inclusion of Janet, while Phil Harrison (The Guardian) called the episode an [...] "object lesson in economical narrative". Mellor summarised the strength of the production and writing by saying that the elements [...] "slotted in with real efficiency. Seeding the UV light early on provided a satisfying pay-off, and the shifts to Janet's aural point of view, along with the use of subtitles and director Guillem Morales' continually inventive shifts in , kept things varied and lively." [...] Nonetheless, she considered the costumes a missed opportunity, perceiving no meaning behind the choices. The episode's greatest achievement, for Mellor, was the [...] "lyrical cleverness".|$|E

With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team."

500|$|Grace {{works closely}} with several allies during his <b>time</b> <b>at</b> <b>All</b> Souls, {{but he is the}} one of few people who is fully aware of the hospital's supernatural occurrences. He collaborates with RN Glory St. Claire, who has a long history with the {{facility}} and [...] "knows more than she can say or, at least, explain". She is characterized by her telepathic powers and older age. According to St. Claire, [...] "the dead have power" [...] in the hospital and the [...] "forces of good" [...] residing inside All Souls had foretold of Grace's arrival for several decades. She connects with Grace by holding his hands to allow him to see the [...] "tortured soul" [...] in the hospital. Grace finds further support from Dr. Nicole De Brae (Serena Scott Thomas), Dr. Bradley Sterling (Daniel Cosgrove), and Patrick Fortado (Adam Rodriguez). De Brae acts as the hospital's chief of staff and Sterling works alongside Grace as a medical intern. Fortado is Grace's close friend, a paraplegic who has great skill at hacking. The exact nature of De Brae's loyalty is called into question, with Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wondering if she will serve as a love interest or be revealed as one of the hospital's spirits. Other members of the medical staff include the psychologist Dr. Philomena Cullen (Reiko Aylesworth) and the orderly Joey (Christian Tessier).|$|E

40|$|Using {{stochastic}} dominance, in {{this paper}} we provide a new characterization of point processes. This characterization leads to a unified proof for various stability results of open Jackson networks where service times are i. i. d. with a general distribution, external interarrival times are i. i. d. with a general distribution and the routing is Bernoulli. We show that if the traffic condition is satisfied, i. e., the input rate is smaller than the service rate at each queue, then the queue length process (the number of customers at each queue) is tight. Under the traffic condition, the p th moment of the queue length process is bounded for all t if the p+ 1 th moment of the service <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> queues are nite. If, furthermore, the moment generating functions of the service <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> queues exist, then all the moments of the queue length process are bounded for all t. When the interarrival times are unbounded and non-lattice (resp. spread-out), the queue lengths and the remaining service times converge in distribution (resp. in total variation) to a steady state. Also, the moments converge if the corresponding moment conditions are satisfied...|$|R
