5|$|A {{long-term}} {{goal of the}} IFAF is for American football <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic sport. The only time that the sport was played was at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but as a demonstration sport. Among the various problems the IFAF has to solve in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> the IOC are building a competitive women's division, expanding the sport into Africa, and overcoming the current worldwide competitive imbalance that {{is in favor of}} American teams.|$|E

5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> other archaeologists.|$|E

5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after that. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> national central banks for ten years or more.|$|E
5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted that several of the boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} season, under new manager Giovanni Trapattoni, Baggio {{finished}} runner-up to Marco van Basten for the Serie A top scorer title, scoring 18 goals and providing 8 assists, as Juventus finished runners-up to Fabio Capello's Milan in Serie A, and to Parma in the Coppa Italia Final, in which Baggio {{scored in the}} first leg from a penalty. It was during his second season with the club that Baggio came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> the Juventus fans, as he {{was seen as a}} leader around whom the club's play revolved. However, Trapattoni often deployed Baggio in a more advanced role, which led to minor disagreements between the player, his coach and Juventus management.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 19th century, the {{principle}} of priority in naming gradually came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> botanists, as did the need for a mechanism by which names in current usage could be conserved against archaic or obscure prior names. By the 1920s, Dryandra R.Br. was effectively conserved against Josephia Knight, although a mechanism for formal conservation was not put in place until 1933. Brown's specific name, however, was not conserved, and Karel Domin overturned Dryandra floribunda R.Br. by transferring Knight's name into Dryandra as Dryandra sessilis (Knight) Domin in 1924. This name was current until 2007, when all Dryandra species were transferred into Banksia by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele. The full citation for the current name is thus Banksia sessilis (Knight) A.R.Mast & K.R.Thiele.|$|E

5|$|Already the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland has a {{great impact}} on the king's powers. From 1505 the king could not pass laws himself without the {{approval}} of the sejm, this being forbidden by Polish szlachta privilege laws like nihil novi. According to the nihil novi constitution, a law passed by the sejm had to be agreed by the three estates (stany sejmujące; the king, the senate and deputies from the sejm proper - the lower chamber). There were only few areas in which the king could pass legislation without consulting the sejm: on royal cities, peasants in royal lands, Jews, fiefs and on mining. The three estates of the sejm had the final decision in legislation on taxation, budget and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign policy (including hearing foreign envoys and sending diplomatic missions) and ennoblement. The sejm received fiscal reports from deputy treasurers, and debated on most important court cases (the sejm court), with the right of amnesty. The sejm could also legislate {{in the absence of the}} king, although such legislation would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> the king ex post.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>by</b> others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about {{her side of the}} story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E
