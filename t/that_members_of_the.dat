5|$|After 10:00 am the {{situation}} rapidly deteriorated when provocateurs came into action, claiming <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negotiating delegation had been arrested. The local {{units of the}} regular police (Milicja Obywatelska) were unable to contain the crowd and {{the situation}} turned into a violent uprising as the crowds stormed the prison at Młyńska Street, where some protesters believed {{the members of the}} delegation to have been imprisoned; hundreds of prisoners were released around 10:50 am. At 11:30 am, the arms depot at the prison building was seized and the firearms were distributed among the demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|Akane and Kogami arrest Makishima but he escapes. Akane is {{disappointed}} when Kogami leaves {{the police force}} to hunt him alone. Akane soon discovers <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sibyl System, a private organization that manages the Psycho-Pass technology, want to use her to capture Makishima alive. Akane agrees on the condition they rescind their orders to kill the defecting Kogami. Despite her efforts, Akane fails to stop Kogami from killing Makishima. The Sibyl System members allow her to live on condition she does not reveal the truth about them. In the epilogue, Akane becomes the de facto leader of Unit One; she is seen briefing a newly recruited Inspector in the finale of season one.|$|E
5|$|Article 12(2) {{is subject}} to an express {{contrary}} authorization by the Constitution.

Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates, {{at least one of}} whom must be from a minority community.

5|$|At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is {{the site}} of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for the occupant of the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and other sources of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{while still}} in the hospital, Kesselring {{accepted}} the honorary presidency of three veterans' organisations. The first was the Luftwaffenring, consisting of Luftwaffe veterans. The Verband deutsches Afrikakorps, the veterans' association of the Afrika Korps, soon followed. More controversial was {{the presidency of the}} right-wing veterans' association, the Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten. Leadership of this organisation tarnished his reputation. He attempted to reform the organisation, proposing that the new German flag be flown instead of the old Imperial Flag; that the old Stahlhelm greeting Front heil! be abolished; and <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Social Democratic Party of Germany be allowed to join. The response was very unenthusiastic.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, kitsunetsuki {{was noted}} {{as a disease}} {{as early as the}} Heian period and {{remained}} a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.|$|E

5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group killed themselves {{because they believed}} the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they {{saw it as a}} way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more {{abundant}} form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. It is uncertain whether they represent {{the site of a}} former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E
5|$|Among the pre-race {{favorites}} was {{the entire}} Spanish contingent of riders. It included two winners of Grand Tours in Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre, along with highly regarded countrymen Alejandro Valverde, {{winner of the}} 2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and the reigning Spanish national road race champion, and Samuel Sánchez, who had won three stages in the 2007 Vuelta a España. They also had 2008 Tour de France points classification winner and three-time world champion Óscar Freire available {{to work on their}} behalf. Valverde was seen as the strongest threat among the Spaniards. Other medal hopefuls included the defending Olympic champion Paolo Bettini of Italy, Germany's Stefan Schumacher, and Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour de France (2007 and 2008). It was thought <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall strong squads from Germany and Luxembourg could also contend for victory. The German team contained Schumacher and many veterans of Grand Tours such as Jens Voigt to work in support, while Luxembourg had the Schleck brothers Andy and Fränk, along with Kim Kirchen, all of whom had worn leader's jerseys during the 2008 Tour de France.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy should not be admitted to the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
5|$|Coke {{undertook}} {{the central}} role in framing and writing the Petition of Right. The ongoing struggles over martial law and civil liberties, along with {{the rejection of the}} Resolutions seriously concerned the Commons. Accordingly, Coke convinced the Lords to meet with the Commons in April 1628 in order to discuss a petition to the King confirming the rights and liberties of royal subjects. The Commons immediately accepted this, and after a struggle, the Lords agreed to allow a committee chaired by Coke to draft the eventual document. Hearing of this, the King sent a message to Parliament forbidding the Commons from discussing matters of state. The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their fear that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. Coke, despite the fear in Parliament, stood and spoke, citing historical precedents supporting the principle <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commons could, within Parliament, say whatever they wished – something now codified as Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

In December 2004 Rush pleaded guilty at the Inala Magistrates' Court in Queensland to 16 offences including drug possession, fraud, theft and drunk-driving. A warrant for his arrest in Australia remains in place over the theft of $A4,797 from the Commonwealth Bank via a forged cheque. Czugaj, also of Brisbane, has 14 convictions for offences including theft, wilful damage, traffic offences and fare evasion.|$|E
