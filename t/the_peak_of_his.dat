5|$|Macartney's {{international}} farewell on the 1926 tour of England {{saw him at}} <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> batting powers. Unlike {{the previous}} tour in 1921, Macartney was also prominent with the ball.|$|E
5|$|Gunn feels <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> playing {{career was}} making {{what he calls}} the save of his life in the UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich in 1993. This event was called the summit of Norwich City's history by The Independent. He is one of only nine Norwich players to win the club's Player of the Year award twice. He was made an inaugural member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. He {{was a member of the}} Scotland {{national}} football team, making six appearances for his country in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|After {{his playing}} career ended, Blake {{went on to}} become a plumber. He spent nearly 50 years in the {{plumbing}} business and was formerly the president of Plumbers Local 360. Blake was married to his wife, Carol Jean, for 47 years before her death. With Carol, he had a son, Ed, and a daughter, Peggy. His son, also named Ed Blake, was a former pitcher who played in the Baltimore Orioles' farm system from 1970 to 1973, playing for the AA affiliate Asheville Orioles at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. His grandson, Ed Blake III, has continued in the footsteps of his father and grandfather as a pitcher in high school. Blake died in Swansea, Illinois at the age of 83 after a long illness, and is interred at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Belleville, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|His {{passion for}} journalism {{drove him to}} <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. In his stay with Times, he would ask to become an {{international}} correspondent, specifically to Southeast Asia, to build up on his portfolio as a journalist. His transfer to the Manila Times helped him a garner a wider audience and readership, doubling his numbers from Chronicle.|$|R
50|$|He has one {{victory in}} Alpine Skiing World Cup. <b>The</b> first <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career was in 1994 Winter Olympics, where he {{finished}} 4th in slalom. In {{the following years}} he was treated for injuries until <b>the</b> second <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career in years 2000-2002, when he won a race in Yongpyong and a bronze medal in Alpine World Ski Championships 2001, both of them in slalom. He retired in 2005 after the race in Kranjska Gora.|$|R
50|$|Stylistically, Petrucciani is most {{frequently}} compared to Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett for his lyricism and Oscar Peterson for his virtuosity. His playing was often quite dramatic; critics {{accuse him of}} over-indulgence and cheap showmanship; sometimes dismiss his music as being too accessible. Petrucciani was loose and playful in a rhythm section, and gave attention to a strong articulation of the melody. He sometimes paused at <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> solo lines before descending again, as if in appreciation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> idea.|$|R
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{power and}} influence, and Hitler {{designated}} {{him as his}} successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Negus {{family moved}} to Haslemere, Surrey. During the Second World War, Negus again served in a medical capacity, {{this time with the}} Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at Horton Hospital, Epsom, from 1939 to 1946. In 1940, on the {{retirement}} of his colleague Charles Hope, he had been appointed senior surgeon at King's College Hospital, and in 1946 he reached <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> profession as a consulting surgeon. During this post-war period one of Negus's patients was the former (and future) prime minister Winston Churchill, who in 1950 was diagnosed by Negus with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Negus retired from clinical and teaching work in 1952 at the age of 65.|$|E
5000|$|In Tashkent, {{he turned}} {{for a while}} to working with folk material, {{producing}} among other works the first Uzbek ballet, Pakhta (Cotton). The works <b>of</b> <b>his</b> last years in Moscow show a simplification <b>of</b> <b>his</b> characteristic language to admit an expanded conception of tonality (for instance in the 24 Preludes for violin and piano), but are still highly professional. Among Roslavets' later compositions, the Chamber symphony (1934-35) demonstrates one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> [...] "new system of sound organisation" [...] in its later phase.|$|R

5|$|His operas remain {{extremely}} popular, especially <b>the</b> three <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 'middle period': Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata, and the 2013 bicentenary <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{birth was}} widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances.|$|R
5|$|Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was {{his final}} major {{compositional}} project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, {{though he never}} published it. During this time Sibelius was at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of {{at least the first}} movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused {{to allow her to}} join Olivier in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E
5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a strategy that altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Emir Assaf, they were confirmed as the rulers of Keserwan by Sultan Selim I following the Ottoman conquest in 1516. Emir Assaf died two years later and was succeeded by his son Hasan, who was in turn killed by his brother Qa'itbay. The latter ruled Keserwan until his death without children in 1523, after which he was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur. Mansur had a long reign and was accorded by the Ottomans numerous districts in Mount Lebanon and its environs as tax farms. He eliminated many of his Sunni rivals, and his local power relied on a Maronite support base and his Maronite agents, namely members of the Hubaysh clan, {{who served as a}} check on the Shia Muslim sheikhs of Keserwan. At <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power, Mansur's realm stretched from Beirut to Homs.|$|E
5|$|Wilton H. St Hill (6 July 1893 – c. 1957) was a West Indian cricketer {{who played}} in West Indies' first Test match during their inaugural Test tour of England. A {{right-handed}} batman {{who played in}} a variety of batting positions, he represented Trinidad in first-class cricket between 1912 and 1930 and played in three Test matches in total. Although his Test record was poor, he was highly regarded in Trinidad. In particular, writer C. L. R. James considered St Hill to be among the top batsmen in the world and dedicated a chapter of Beyond a Boundary to him. At <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, Lord Harris described him as the best batsman in the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Born in England, Brooks {{emigrated to}} Australia {{as a toddler}} and started {{swimming}} lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, {{but it was not}} until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> swimming career came in the 4100m medley relay, when he caught and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.|$|E

5000|$|Boris Papandopulo (Honnef am Rhein, today's Bad Honnef, February 25, 1906 [...] - [...] Zagreb, October 16, 1991) was a Croatian {{composer}} and conductor of Russian Jewish descent. He {{was the son}} of Greek nobleman Konstantin Papandopulo and Croatian opera singer Maja Strozzi-Pečić {{and one of the most}} distinctive Croatian musicians of the 20th century. Papandopulo also worked as music writer, journalist, reviewer, pianist and piano accompanist; however, he achieved <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career in music as a composer. His composing oeuvre is imposing (counting cca 460 works): with great success he created instrumental (orchestral, concertante, chamber and solo), vocal and instrumental (for solo voice and choir), stage music and film music. In all these kinds and genres he left a string of anthology-piece compositions of great artistic value.|$|R
5|$|Freedom of Worship is {{the second}} {{of a series of}} four oil {{paintings}} by Norman Rockwell entitled Four Freedoms. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941, known as Four Freedoms. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution are freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the Allies' World War II policy statement, the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). For the essay accompanying Freedom of Worship, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fame. At the time, Durant {{was in the midst of}} working on his ten-volume The Story of Civilization, coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
5|$|He then struck 114 as {{his state}} {{defeated}} the tourists by an innings, {{and he made}} 40 and a duck as the Australians took the series lead in the Second Test. He made 70 and 71 in the Third Test loss in Sydney, {{one of the few}} players able to combat Lance Gibbs effectively, top-scoring in the first innings and second top-scoring in the second innings. He then made 65 in the second innings in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, where Australia held on by one wicket for a draw. He contributed 48 in the second innings of the Fifth Test as Australia appeared headed for a series victory. However, a late collapse ensued, and Australia scraped home by two wickets to take the series 2–1. O'Neill ended the series with 522 runs at 52.20. O'Neill gained attention during the summer for frequently losing his wicket by impulsively sweeping. This was attributed to the dominance of his bottom hand, which saw his bat swinging across the line of flight of the ball. Despite the criticism, he was at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> international career, having made 1398 runs at 58.35 in his first 18 Tests.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{returned}} to Australia in 1980 {{for the national}} championships and gained selection for the Moscow Olympics by winning the backstroke double. Kerry declined financial inducements and resisted political pressure from the government of Australia to boycott the Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He {{went on to win}} bronze in the 200m backstroke after missing the final in the 100m. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career came in the 4100m medley relay, where he led off the winning team. The race remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at the Olympics. After the games, Kerry took an extended break from the sport, before returning for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He claimed a bronze in the medley relay and came fifth in the 100m backstroke. He then retired and took up a television and modelling career in the United States. After returning to Australia, he ran and owned Dunhill Management, one of the largest recruiting firms in the nation, with his brother. In 2001, the Kerry brothers sold Dunhill for , with up to A$13.8million in additional payments depending on the success of the company. They later founded a new recruitment firm, K2.|$|E

25|$|During {{his club}} career, Litmanen {{represented}} Reipas, HJK, MyPa and Lahti in Finland, and Ajax, Barcelona, Liverpool, Hansa Rostock and Malmö FF abroad. Once {{considered one of}} the best attacking midfielders in the world, he became the first Finnish footballing superstar while playing for Ajax in the mid-1990s, winning the Champions League in 1995, <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> year <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career.|$|R
50|$|Olsen {{teamed with}} Dr. Hannibal (Steve Gillespie). This was <b>the</b> {{successful}} <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career. He feuded with many Japanese like Tarzan Goto, Hayabusa, Mr. Gannosuke and Atsushi Onita. He feuded with other wrestlers such as Sabu, The Sheik and Mike Awesome, {{who was known}} as the Gladiator. In February 1993, he and Dr. Hannibal joined the original Team Canada, which included The Gladiator, Big Titan, and Ricky Fuji.|$|R
5|$|Macartney scored 2,207 runs {{during the}} tour {{at an average}} of 45.04. During the English season, he reached <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{performance}} as an all-rounder, taking 38 wickets. He made six centuries, including two in one match against Sussex. Apart from his 99 at Lord's, Macartney did not pass 34 in the other Tests and ended with 197 runs at 32.83. He did not bowl heavily during the series, taking six wickets at 23.66. It was not a happy tour for the Australians; without the senior players, there were frequent reports of drunken brawls and verbal abuse towards the locals. Macartney was one of only four players to accept the guaranteed tour fee of 400 pounds; the others signed up to a percentage share of the profits and the commercial failure of the tour left them with {{less than half of the}} flat fee.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the {{original}} version had included Sheikh Patrash Pasha showing Tintin a copy of Tintin in America, in the 1955 version this was changed to the earlier Tintin in the Congo, and Hergé would change it again for subsequent printings, this time to Destination Moon (1953), an Adventure set chronologically after Cigars. Benoît Peeters exclaimed that with this scene, the reader can imagine Tintin's surprise at encountering an adventure {{he had not yet}} had and which included the characters of Captain Haddock and Cuthbert Calculus whom he had not yet met. Another anachronism in this version appears when Snowy refers to Marlinspike Hall, the ancestral home of Captain Haddock, from the much later volumes of the series. Harry Thompson opined that the most important changes to the book were artistic, for in the late 1950s Hergé was at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> artistic ability.|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{successfully}} withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman {{governors of}} the Sidon and Damascus provinces, {{who attempted to}} limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt secure enough to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold {{in the summer of}} 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.|$|E
