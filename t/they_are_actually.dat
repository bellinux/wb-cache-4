5|$|Although certain {{levels of}} {{antioxidant}} vitamins {{in the diet}} are required for good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) are needed from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Floating, serene aliens {{known as}} Engineers, or Huragok, were pulled from Combat Evolved, but made later {{appearances}} in the Halo novels. They also appeared in Halo Wars, Halo 3: ODST, and Halo: Reach. They serve no actual combat role, although in Halo 3: ODST, Halo Wars and Halo Reach they can aid players or enemies. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> artificial lifeforms created by the vanished technologically superior race known as the Forerunners, and are enslaved by the Covenant to build, repair and maintain their technology.|$|E
5|$|Grant, {{demanding}} {{the truth from}} the Kirbys, learns <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> a middle-class divorced couple, {{who are looking for}} their son Eric, and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who have been missing on the island for eight weeks. Later, the group finds the parasail with Ben's corpse attached. The group takes the parasail, and then encounter raptor nests. They find an abandoned InGen compound, where Amanda is ambushed by a raptor. The group manages to trap it, but it escapes and contacts the rest of its pack. The group flees into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede, separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Grant retrieves Billy's satchel, while Udesky is left on the ground barely alive by the raptors, who set a trap in an attempt to lure the others out of the tree they had climbed into. Amanda is nearly killed by the raptors when she tries to descend to help Udesky, and upon the failure of their trap, the raptors kill Udesky before departing.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

25|$|In addition, cranky {{scientific}} theories do {{not in fact}} {{qualify as}} theories as this term is commonly understood within science.
