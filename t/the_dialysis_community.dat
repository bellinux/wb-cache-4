Recent evidence on hospitalizations and mortality, however, challenged {{the benefit of}} lower dialysate sodium prescriptions and ignited a debate in <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> <b>community.</b> We therefore studied the relationship between dialysate sodium and blood pressure over the longer term. METHODS We used multiply adjusted linear mixed models to estimate the association between dialysate sodium and predialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP) as well as change in SBP (delta SBP; postdialysis minus predialysis) in 23, 962 patients from the international Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study.

40|$|The Renal Access Nurse has {{recently}} {{become an integral}} member of the renal health care team in Australia. Research {{has shown that the}} introduction of a Renal Access Nurse into <b>dialysis</b> units enhances <b>the</b> referral process for new access, improves survival rates, and success of access creation. Australia has been relatively slow in the introduction {{of the role of the}} Renal Access Nurse. The USA, UK and Europe have been utilising Renal Access Nurses in renal units for many years and their roles are firmly entrenched. The first Renal Access Nurse was introduced in Victoria in 2003, increasing to 7 in 2007. It was evident in 2006 that a networking system for Renal Access Nurses was needed in Victoria, so RAN-Vic was born. RAN-Vic consists of 6 Renal Access Nurses from the major hubs in Melbourne and Geelong, thus covering a large part of <b>the</b> Victorian <b>dialysis</b> <b>community</b> through satellite units throughout the state. The group meet quarterly, with the main goals being to network, share ideas, support each other with challenges arising from the new role, benchmark, undertake quality initiatives and education of renal nursing staff.

40|$|Background: In Australia over 1100 {{people are}} living on {{dialysis}} while waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. Worldwide {{there are an estimated}} 170, 000 people who wait an average of three years before an organ becomes available. Objective: To provide an understanding of the lived experience of people waiting on dialysis for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. Approach: A qualitative descriptive research design was used. Participants were recruited from a large metropolitan hospital. Two focus groups were conducted with six participants ranging in age from 29 - 63 years, with dialysis experience of 10 - 72 months. Data saturation was achieved and thematic analysis was used to interpret the data providing a descriptive account of the experience of waiting for a kidney transplant. Findings: Waiting for a kidney transplant takes place in the context of living on dialysis. Four main themes were identified: living on dialysis is physically and mentally demanding; living with uncertainty; altered relationship dynamics; and feelings towards the deceased donor. Conclusions: This study provides a descriptive summary of {{what it is like to}} live on dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor from the perspective of the person waiting. People are burdened by; uncertainty; the experience of the dialysis therapy; and the thought of the human cost of transplantation. These findings suggest that this cohort may benefit from strategies to relieve uncertainty such as effective communication from the treating team and peer support from <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> <b>community...</b>|$|E

Objective: We seek differences among incident HD patients according to the distance between home and <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center. Methods: We included 179 CKD patients undergoing HD. Patients were stratified in two groups: "living near <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center" (patients whose hometown was in cities up to 100 km from <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center) or as "living far from <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center" (patients whose hometown was more than 100 km from <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center). Socioeconomic status, laboratory results, awareness of CKD before starting HD, consultation with nephrologist before the first HD session, and type of vascular access when starting HD were compared between the two groups. Comparisons of continuous and categorical variables were performed using Student's t-test and the Chi-square test, respectively. Results: Ninety (50. 3 %) patients were classified as "living near <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center" and 89 (49. 7 %) as "living far from <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center". Patients living near <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center {{were more likely to}} know about their condition of CKD than those living far from <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> center, respectively 46. 6 % versus 28. 0 % (p = 0. 015).

40|$|Acute {{aluminum}} encephalopathy in a dialysis center {{caused by}} a cement mortar water distribution pipe. BackgroundIn Curaçao, distilled seawater from the water plant was used without further purification for hemodialysis for several decades. A new distribution pipe supplying water to a dialysis center on the island was installed in May 1996. To protect it from corrosion, this pipe was lined on the inside with a cement mortar. Because of the aggressiveness of the distilled water, calcium and aluminum (Al) leached from the cement mortar into the water used to prepare dialysate. This caused a possible hard water syndrome and definite acute Al intoxication. MethodsWe reviewed clinical details and outcome at follow-up, and arranged laboratory and toxicological studies of serum and hemodialysis water. ResultsOf the 27 patients who had a similar exposure (∼ 60 hours) to the contaminated dialysate, 10 died from acute Al encephalopathy, whereas 17 patients had no or only minor symptoms and survived. The nonsurvivors were older (64 ± 3 years vs. 52 ± 2 years, P 0. 05). Serum Al concentrations, available in seven nonsurvivors, {{were significantly higher than}} in the survivors (808 ± 127 vs. 255 ± 25 μg/L, P < 0. 01). ConclusionsThe water distribution pipe was lined with a cement mortar that was probably inappropriate for transporting drinking water. Water distribution facilities as well as <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> <b>community</b> {{should be aware of the}} possibility of Al leaching from cemented water distribution pipes. Similar Al loads appear to induce a more severe intoxication in malnourished, older patients with smaller Al distribution volumes and anuria...|$|E

The sampling procedure was a purposive sampling. Twenty two patients with Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) disease who were haemodialysed at 5 th Azar hospital of Gorgan Dialysis Center (2005). Twenty two age and sex matched healthy control were recruited for this study. Plasma level of malondialdehyde and uric acid were significantly increased and reduced in the postdialysis group when compared with predialysis and control group, respectively (p< 0. 001). The plasma level of albumin and total bilirubin were significantly increased in postdialysis group when compared with predialysis group (p< 0. 001). The increasing level of plasma lipid peroxidation and the significant difference of non-enzymic antioxidants in the haemodialyzed pateints after <b>the</b> process of <b>dialysis,</b> maybe related with the pateint uremia, the quality of consumed water in <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> procedure, <b>dialysis</b> membrane and <b>the</b> loss of these antioxidants through membranes and hemoconcenteration of them during <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> process and <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> process (may increase lipid peroxidation during <b>the</b> <b>dialysis</b> process).
