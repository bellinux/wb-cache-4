5|$|For {{his second}} voyage Morrell {{took charge of}} a new ship, <b>Tartar,</b> which sailed from New York on July 19, 1824 for the Pacific Ocean. In {{the next two years}} <b>Tartar</b> first {{explored}} the American coastline from the Straits of Magellan to Cape Blanco (now in Oregon). He then sailed westward to the islands of Hawaii, known at that time as the Sandwich Islands, where Captain James Cook had met his death nearly 40 years earlier. Thereafter <b>Tartar</b> returned to the American coast and tracked slowly southwards back to the Straits of Magellan.|$|E

5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two Polaris nuclear ballistic missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 <b>Tartar</b> SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.|$|E
5|$|Ivan IV {{regarded}} the Livonian Confederation's {{approach to the}} Polish–Lithuanian union for protection under the Treaty of Pozvol as casus belli. In 1554 Livonia and Russia had signed a fifteen-year truce in which Livonia agreed not to enter into an alliance with Poland–Lithuania. In January 1558, Ivan reacted with the invasion of Livonia. The Russians were seen by local peasants as liberators from the German control of Livonia. Many Livonian fortresses surrendered without resistance while Russian troops took Dorpat in May, Narva in July, and laid siege to Reval. Reinforced by 1,200 landsknechte, 100 gunners and ammunition from Germany, Livonian forces successfully retook Wesenberg (Rakvere) along {{with a number of}} other fortresses. Although the Germans raided Russian territory, Dorpat, Narva and many lesser fortresses remained in Russian hands. The initial Russian advance was led by the Khan of Kasimov Shahghali, with two other <b>Tartar</b> princes {{at the head of a}} force that included Russian boiars, <b>Tartar</b> and pomest'e cavalry as well as cossacks, who at that time were mostly armed foot soldiers. Ivan gained further ground in campaigns during the years 1559 and 1560. In January 1559, Russian forces again invaded Livonia. A six-month truce covering May to November was signed between Russia and Livonia while Russia fought in the Russo-Crimean Wars.|$|E

Gosiewski then ravaged Ducal Prussia, burning 13 towns and 250 villages, in a {{campaign}} that entered folklore {{because of the high}} death toll and the high number of captives deported to the Crimea.|$|E

5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove <b>tartar</b> (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
5|$|Plaque is a biofilm {{consisting}} of {{large quantities of}} various bacteria that form on teeth. If not removed regularly, plaque buildup can lead to periodontal problems such as gingivitis. Given time, plaque can mineralize along the gingiva, forming <b>tartar.</b> The microorganisms that form the biofilm are almost entirely bacteria (mainly streptococcus and anaerobes), with the composition varying by location in the mouth. Streptococcus mutans {{is the most important}} bacterium associated with dental caries.|$|E
5|$|Poland did {{not follow}} up this victory {{politically}} or militarily. A cease-fire contracted at Stary Targ (the Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 favored the Swedes, who received the right to tax Polish trade moving over the Baltic (3.5% {{of the value of}} goods), retained control of many cities in Royal Prussia, and were recognized as the dominant power on the southern Baltic coast. Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he had been called back to Ukraine to crush a <b>Tartar</b> incursion.|$|E

50|$|The Lament for the Destruction of Hungary by the <b>Tartars</b> (Latin Planctus destructionis regni Hungariae per Tartaros) is a {{prominent}} piece of medieval Latin Hungarian poetry. It {{was written in}} 1242, shortly after the invasion of Hungary by the <b>Tartars</b> of Batu Khan, by a monk in the retinue of King Béla IV.|$|R
50|$|In 1241, the <b>Tartars</b> invaded Hungary {{and killed}} Herzog Coloman {{on the river}} of Šaj. King Bela IV was on the retreat which enabled Ninoslav to restore control over most of Bosnia.

5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe <b>Tartar,</b> Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the <b>Tartar</b> design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1323, Polo was {{confined}} to bed, due to illness. On January 8, 1324, despite physicians' efforts to treat him, Polo was on his deathbed. To write and certify the will, his family requested Giovanni Giustiniani, a priest of San Procolo. His wife, Donata, and his three daughters were appointed by him as co-executrices. The church was entitled by law to {{a portion of his}} estate; he approved of this and ordered that a further sum be paid to the convent of San Lorenzo, the place where he wished to be buried. He also set free Peter, a <b>Tartar</b> servant, who may have accompanied him from Asia, and to whom Polo bequeathed 100 lire of Venetian denari.|$|E

Thus, at present, the Holy Land might be recovered {{with the help of the}} <b>Tartars</b> and the realm of Egypt, easily conquered without peril or danger.

5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (<b>Tartar</b> Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
5|$|Old Jock (18591871), was a Fox Terrier famous {{during the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. A mostly white dog, he ran briefly with a hunting kennel before {{becoming}} a show dog, most notably with a victory at the show which popularised the Fox Terrier. His main show rivalry was with a dog named <b>Tartar,</b> and along with a dog named Trap, the three were popular sires of the Fox Terrier breed. He was also involved in the early formation of the Jack Russell Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and <b>tartar.</b> A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E

5|$|Cortina has {{attracted}} many distinguished guests, often inspiring {{them in their}} creative work. They include the Italian novelists Dino Buzzati (1906–1972), author of The <b>Tartar</b> Steppe, Goffredo Parise (1929–1986) and Fernanda Pivano (1917–2009). Ernest Hemingway, author of A Farewell to Arms, also arrived {{in the area in}} 1918 as a young ambulance driver. Other notable visitors include John Ball (1818–1889), the Irish mountaineer and naturalist who climbed Monte Pelmo in 1857, the Italian mountaineers Emilio Comici (1901–1940), Angelo Dibona (1879–1956) and Lino Lacedelli (1925–2009), the Italian skier Kristian Ghedina (born 1969), the Italian bobsledder Eugenio Monti (1928–2003), the Austrian mountaineer Paul Grohmann (1838–1908) and the Austrian skier Toni Sailer (1935–2009).

5|$|Iron Arm, Golden Sabre {{was written}} by Wang Yun Heng and Xiao Yun Long and {{published}} in 1986. This novel, which serves as Zhou's own fictional biography, is a prequel to The Story of Yue Fei because it details his adventures decades prior to taking Yue Fei as his student. It follows {{his life as a}} young martial arts instructor in the Song army's Imperial guard, his struggles against the Xixia and Liao <b>Tartar</b> barbarian tribes and his tutelage of Water Margin outlaws. The last few chapters incorporate the storyline from the four chapters that he appears in The Story of Yue Fei.

5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a <b>Tartar</b> missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the cost of building the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E
