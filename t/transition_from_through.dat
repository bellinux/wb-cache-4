40|$|Structural {{elements}} of a syn-kinematic pluton in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia reflect evolving rheology during progressive crystallisation, representing a <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> magmatic, <b>through</b> high-temperature sub-solidus to low-temperature deformation. Magmatic elements include: (1) NNE-trending, sub-vertical, kilometre-scale folds (outlined by xenolith trains) that have a magmatic axial planar foliation defined by aligned K-feldspar, (2) cross-cutting, ENE-trending, sub-vertical shear zones intruded by numerous ≤metre-scale granite sheets, and (3) a narrow, concordant magmatic K-feldspar foliation in the granite host-rock adjacent to the shear zones. Microstructures, such as fractured feldspars healed by quartz that is continuous with matrix grains, further suggest that deformation occurred while the pluton was magmatic. High-temperature structural elements include ‘checkerboard’ sub-grain boundaries in quartz, whereas deformation at lower temperatures is indicated by kinked feldspar, recrystallised microcline and undulose quartz. A NNE-trending, sub-vertical sub-solidus foliation, defined by elongate quartz aggregates, overprints all the above mentioned features. Generation of these sequential structural elements correspond to the <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> Newtonian-fluid, <b>through</b> Bingham-type, to Newtonian-solid behaviour as the crystal fraction of the felsic magma increased.
