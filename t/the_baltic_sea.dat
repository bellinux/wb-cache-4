5|$|Friedrich Carl {{served with}} the fleet until 1 March 1909, when she was {{withdrawn}} {{for use as a}} torpedo training ship. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, when she was again placed in active service with the cruiser division in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> In October 1914, Friedrich Carl was the first German warship to carry seaplanes. The ship carried two planes provisionally and had no permanent modifications made to support them. She was made the flagship of Rear Admiral Behring, the commander of the German cruiser squadron in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea.</b> The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. The German naval command was aware that British submarines were operating in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> and so ordered Behring to attack the Russian port at Libau to prevent it from being used as a British submarine base.|$|E
5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> or up to 18‰ in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea</b> and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade.

The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> controlled the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> <b>Sea,</b> collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
