Firstly by looking at quality issues which are important to all professional information seeking tasks, and which should not be overlooked in order for advances in information retrieval to be acceptance by this community; and secondly to provide an example of a specific information retrieval task which, not only requires all the common quality criteria to be met, but is also common to three different professional groups. It is hoped that by considering common tasks such as this, fruitful directions for future research in IR which will benefit a wider number of information seekers will be realised. For the professional information user confidence in quality derives from data integrity, meaning information security, repeatability, <b>transparency,</b> timeliness, <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> of information source, system and solution. Secondly an example of a use case common to three professional user groups will be used to illustrate these quality requirements, and to also describe again the complexity of professional information needs, but also, hopefully to illustrate some further area where information retrieval advances would be welcomed. ...|$|R
40|$|The act of {{engaging}} in sound and ethical practitioner research, regardless of context, encourages and indeed demands an alignment between the ethical framework employed in the research enterprise and the 'everyday ethics' of practice. This paper explores the ethical dimensions of what Cochran-Smith and Lytle have termed the dialectic of practitioner inquiry. The paper argues that the reflexive nature of the theory/practice dynamic means that, {{in the context of}} sustained practitioner inquiry, the ethics of research and the ethics of practice both hold the potential to be shaped by and to shape the other. Elsewhere in discussions of the issue of quality in practitioner and other practice-based research, Groundwater-Smith and Mockler have argued that ethical professionalism can and does work as a platform for quality, pushing practitioner inquiry 'beyond celebration'. This paper builds on these ideas and, in exploring the intersection of inquiry and practice in practitioner research, examines the implications of issues relating to: informed consent; 'voice' <b>and</b> ownership; <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> negotiation; <b>confidentiality,</b> anonymity <b>and</b> trust; and deliberative action in the context of both practitioner inquiry and classroom practice. © 2014 © 2014 Educational Action Research...|$|R

In such a transparent environment, it becomes easier for suppliers to obtain information that may allow them to infer their rivals' costs. Is this good news or bad news? In this study, {{we focus on the}} informational effects of business-to-business (B 2 B) exchanges, and explore firms' incentives to join a B 2 B exchange that provides an online platform for information transmission. We then study the equilibria by developing a game-theoretic model under asymmetric information. We examine whether the incentives to join a B 2 B exchange would be different under different competition modes (quantity and price), different information structures, and by varying the nature of the products (substitutes and complements). Our results challenge the "information transparency hypothesis" (i. e., open sharing of information in electronic markets is beneficial to all participating firms). In contrast to the popular belief, we show that information transparency could be a double-edged sword. The individual rationality of participation in the online exchange reflects the tradeoff between information <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> data <b>confidentiality.</b> This may have important implications for the microstructure design (e. g., data access rules) of B 2 B electronic marketplaces. information economics, information transparency, economics of electronic markets, online exchange, asymmetric information, game theory, information transparency hypothesis, B 2 B...|$|R

Openness {{is defined as}} the extent to which interested parties are enabled to participate in EFSA’s decision making processes. Openness and transparency are recognised as two of the principles available to the European Union, whose implementation may contribute to legitimise its existence and administrative action vis-à-vis the European citizens and taxpayers. This also holds true for Union agencies and transparency is one of EFSA’s core organisational value together with openness, scientific excellence and independence. In this context EFSA’s Management Board adopted in 2003 EFSA’s approach to “openness, transparency and confidentiality” and in 2005 it issued a decision concerning implementing measures of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> EFSA’s Scientific Committee issued in 2006 and 2009 two opinions on transparency in risk assessment one related to procedural aspects and the other related to scientific aspects...|$|E

40|$|The EU {{securities}} {{market regulation}} {{is under a}} reform. The new Market Abuse Regulation (the MAR) was passed in summer 2014 and it will come into force and replace the current Market Abuse Directive (the MAD) in July 2016. The MAR has been enacted as a regulation and it thus has a direct effect, i. e. it will be directly applicable in all Member States. The MAR will tighten the ongoing disclosure regulation, which means in practice that issuers are required to disclose more information than ever before. Most importantly, the MAR extends the obligation to disclose also to uncertain information relating to future events. Consequently, such a far-reaching disclosure obligation requires correction not to jeopardise issuer interests. Correction {{is provided by the}} delayed disclosure provision, the interpretation of which will be the hot question of the EU disclosure regulation in the near future. The delayed disclosure mechanism will serve as a safe harbour to issuers. However, entry to the safe harbour is strictly regulated by three criteria (i. e. legitimate interests of the issuer, misleading the public and confidentiality of the information) which need to be met in order to grant the access to the harbour. The interpretation of the criteria is a dilemma and a solution to it needs to be found to strike an optimal balance between disclosure and delayed disclosure. In other words, there is a conflict of transparency, favoured by investors, and confidentiality, favoured by issuers, and a balance between these conflicting interests is needed. Finding the optimal balance is not only in the interest of issuers and investors but also of the market in general, as disclosure is a key to efficient and well-functioning securities markets. The answer to the dilemma lies in how broadly or narrowly the criteria for delayed disclosure are interpreted, and this thesis thus focuses on searching for the optimal balance by means of interpretation. The thesis concentrates on the following research problems: 1) what is the current status of the disclosure regulation across Europe, 2) on what grounds may an issuer delay the disclosure of inside information, and 3) how should the disclosure and delayed disclosure be balanced i. e. what should the balance be between <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality?</b> Discussing the first question lays the foundation for the thesis. The implementation of MAD in chosen Member States, i. e. Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, will be discussed in order to map the current status of the disclosure regulation and the challenges that will be faced in the era of the MAR. Discussing the second question includes a thorough analysis of the criteria for delayed disclosure, the interpretation of which is the key to finding the optimal balance for <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> Again, the practices adopted across Member States will be analysed in order to get an overall picture of the functioning of the delayed disclosure mechanism. Finally, the third question leads to the core of the thesis and to the proposed solution on how the conflict of <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> should be solved and how the disclosure and delayed disclosure should be balanced. The thesis contributes mainly to the EU securities market law, but interfaces to other fields of law, company and criminal law in particular, have also been taken into account. A pluralistic method has been adopted in the thesis and it contains elements from legal dogmatics, law and economics as well as from comparative law. Legal dogmatics is the core, whereas law and economics and comparative law bring perspective to the thesis and diversify the analysis. Further, a market-based interpretation method has been applied, which combines the teleological interpretation method typical for EU law and economic argumentation needed in securities market law. Using the market-based method in interpreting the disclosure regulation is crucial in order to take into consideration the market environment and the purpose of the regulation and to find an optimal balance for disclosure and delayed disclosure...|$|E

40|$|The {{contractual}} {{nature of}} arbitration {{as a form}} of alternative dispute resolution in the context of cross-border/international disputes traditionally emphasises confidentiality as one of the fundamental characteristics of international arbitration. Confidentiality is often assumed to be a common feature and advantage of international commercial arbitration, and the privacy of arbitral proceedings has facilitated and encouraged recourse to arbitration. However, the issue of confidentiality has a different dimension and is limited in the context of international investment and trade disputes. The participation of States, State entities, sub-divisions and agencies in international disputes shifts the emphasis from privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> to <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> accountability. This study analyses the role of confidentiality in investor-State arbitration, noting that confidentiality is not always preserved in many respects and stages throughout the arbitration proceedings. The paper considers the issues that challenge the legal effectiveness of confidentiality in international investor-State arbitration and the development towards transparency. In particular, the paper examines the participation of non-disputing/third parties in investor-State arbitration, the different approaches of major arbitral institutions towards the issue of <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>and</b> the arguments for <b>and</b> against <b>confidentiality</b> in relation to transparency.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{economic}} rationality and ethical behavior cannot be reduced {{one to the}} other, casting doubts on the validity of formulas like 'profit is ethical' or 'ethics pays'. In order to express ethical dilemmas as opposing economic interest with ethical concerns, we propose a model of rational behavior that combines these two irreducible dimensions in an open but not arbitrary manner. Behaviors that are neither ethical nor profitable are considered irrational (non-arbitrariness). However, behaviors that are profitable but unethical, and behaviors that are ethical but not profitable, are all treated as rational (openness). Combining ethical concerns with economic interest, ethical business is in turn an optimal form of rationality between venality and sacrifice. Because every one prefers to communicate that he acts ethically, ethical business remains ambiguous until some economic interest is actually sacrificed. We argue however that ethical business {{has an interest in}} demonstrating its consistency between communication and behavior by a transparent attitude. On the other hand, venal behaviors must remain confidential to hide the corresponding lack of consistency. This discursive approach based on <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> helps to further distinguish between ethical and unethical business behaviors.

40|$|The {{negotiations}} between the EU and the US over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have generated {{a lot of discussion}} about investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). This discussion provided the inspiration for this thesis, with the TTIP in the background, setting the scene. In this thesis I study the nature of ISDS and the principle of transparency within investor-state arbitration. I aim to determine whether the use of ISDS is restricted to international arbitration and whether ISDS can be considered to constitute a system or regime. Furthermore, I consider whether the introduction of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (2014, the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules) changes investor-state arbitration in relation to transparency. To achieve this, I examine ISDS provisions in several different international investment agreements (IIAs) and evaluate the ways in which transparency is incorporated into investment law. Moreover, I compare the provisions on <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in institutional arbitration rules with the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules. I have formed several conclusions, including that the ISDS provisions may contain methods other than international arbitration and that ISDS does not constitute a system. Furthermore, the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules do change – theoretically, at least – investor-state arbitration to become more transparent. Whether the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules will make investor-state arbitration fully transparent depends on the actions of the contracting state parties when negotiating new IIAs and whether they choose to incorporate the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules in the IIAs already concluded...|$|E
