40|$|A new handoff {{management}} scheme for wireless ATM networks is proposed. In this scheme, all cells {{are connected to}} their neighboring cells by permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) and to the access switch (AS) by switched virtual circuits (SVCs) which are only for new calls. Some carefully chosen cells, called rerouting cells, are also connected to the AS by PVCs.

If a mobile roams to a rerouting cell, its <b>traffic</b> <b>path</b> is rerouted to a PVC between the AS and rerouting cell. By using PVC's for handoff calls, we can guarantee fast and seamless handoff. At the same time, our scheme improves the path efficiency by limiting the maximum number of hops that a path can be extended.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{critical}} event monitoring in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where {{only a small number}} of packets need to be transmitted most of the time. When a critical event occurs, an alarm message should be broadcast to the entire network as soon as possible. To prolong the network lifetime, some sleep scheduling methods are always employed in WSNs, resulting in significant broadcasting delay, especially in large scale WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel sleep scheduling method to reduce the delay of alarm broadcasting from any sensor node in WSNs. Specifically, we design two determined <b>traffic</b> <b>paths</b> for the transmission of alarm message, and level-by-level offset based wake-up pattern according to the paths, respectively. When a critical event occurs, an alarm is quickly transmitted along one of the <b>traffic</b> <b>paths</b> to a center node, and then it is immediately broadcast by the center node along another path without collision. Therefore, two of the big contributions are that the broadcasting delay is independent of the density of nodes and its energy consumption is ultra low. Exactly, the upper bound of the broadcasting delay is only 3 D+ 2 L, where D is the maximum hop of nodes to the center node, L is the length of sleeping duty cycle, and the unit is the size of time slot. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate these notable performances of the proposed method compared with existing works. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) {{architecture}} [2] {{has recently}} become the preferred method for addressing QoS issues in IP networks. An end-to-end differentiated service is obtained through the concatenation of per-domain services and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between adjoining domains along the <b>traffic</b> <b>path,</b> from source to destination. Per-domain services are realized by traffic conditioning {{at the edge}} and simple differentiated forwarding mechanisms {{at the core of}} the network. One of the forwarding mechanisms recently standardized by the IETF is the Assured Forwarding (AF) [4] Per Hop Behaviors (PHB). The basis of the AF PHB is differentiated dropping of packets during congestion at a router. To build an end-toend service with AF, subscribed traffic profiles for customers are maintained at the traffic conditioning nodes at the edge of the network. The aggregated traffic is monitored; and packets are marked at the traffic conditioner. When a...|$|E

In this paper we address an open problem in the book "Optimal transportation networks" by Bernot, Caselles and Morel and we improve the stability for optimal traffic paths in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, with respect to variations of the given measures $(\mu^-,\mu^+) $, which was known up to now only for $\alpha> 1 -\frac 1 d$. We prove it for exponents $\alpha> 1 -\frac 1 {d- 1 }$ (in particular, for every $\alpha \in (0, 1) $ when $d= 2 $), for a fairly large class of measures $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$...|$|E
40|$|In OpenFlow, {{control and}} data plane are {{decoupled}} from switches/routers. Direct programming of routers/switches is realised {{from one or}} more servers (so called controllers). In {{the case of an}} in-band OpenFlow network, the control traffic (traffic to or from the controllers) is sent on the same channel used to transport data traffic. Therefore, when a failure occurs along the data <b>traffic</b> <b>path,</b> both control and data traffic can be affected. This paper explains how failure recovery can be deployed in such a network. To achieve carrier-grade quality, the network should be able to recover from the failure within 50 ms. We apply two well-known recovery mechanisms -restoration and protection-for the control and the data traffic, and run extensive emulation experiments. The emulation results show that restoration does not allow to recover within 50 ms. Moreover, the restoration of the control traffic delays the restoration of the data traffic. The emulation results also show that protection for both control and data traffic can meet the carrier-grade recovery requirement, even in a large-scale network serving many flows...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In sensor {{networks}} it {{is critical}} to conserve energy as replacing batteries is an expensive manual operation. Energy needs to be saved when events are detected as well as when there is no event. Current sleep-scheduling approaches for sensor networks that address energy consumption either only save energy when idling or have high latencies and low channel utilization. Our contribution is an energy efficient sleepscheduling protocol called BSMac for sensor networks while maintaining high throughput and low latency. BSMac is based on a new architecture called BoostNet in which the base station broadcasts critical scheduling coordination information using large transmission range to reach all sensor nodes in one hop. Nodes assigns colors sequentially to the outgoing links along the <b>traffic</b> <b>path,</b> and nodes not on the data path operate at a low dutycycle. To accommodate different traffic patterns, the number of colors is critical. To achieve optimal throughput, the base station experiments the network with different maximum number of colors periodically. The performance of BSMac is evaluated using simulations. In comparison to CSMA based approach, BSMac can reduce energy consumption by up to 80 % while maintaining similar throughput and latency. I...|$|E

The term ASTN replaces the term ASON (Automatically Switched Optical Network) and is often used interchangeably with GMPLS (Generalized MPLS).

The requirements of the ASON/ASTN architecture can be satisfied using GMPLS protocols developed by the IETF or by GMPLS protocols that have been modified by the ITU. Furthermore, the GMPLS protocols are applicable to optical and non-optical (e.g., packet and frame) networks, and can be used in transport or client networks. Thus, GMPLS is a wider concept than ASTN.|$|R
