5|$|After Simpson's {{decision}} {{to focus on}} Fightstar, the band entered Criterion Studios in London with producer Mark Williams to begin work on their first EP, <b>They</b> <b>Liked</b> You Better When You Were Dead. It was released as a mini-album, containing nine tracks written during the six months Simpson and Westaway lived together. Recording sessions were often interrupted, since Simpson {{was in the midst}} of a sold-out series of Wembley shows with Busted.|$|E
5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> it. For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> it very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E
5|$|Later studies {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} the effect. Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg sought to explore how automatic the preference process was. They did this with both numbers and letters. They divided participants into two groups. The first group was asked to give quick, intuitive reactions stating preferences for the stimuli. The second group was asked to reason why <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> some numbers better than others and to analyse which features of the numbers <b>they</b> <b>liked.</b> As the researchers had predicted, they found that both the birthday-number effect and name-letter effect disappeared in the ‘thinking’ condition. They argued that thinking about reasons instigates deliberative overriding of implicit self-esteem effects. This conclusion was supported by looking at correlations between the effects: whereas in the feeling condition {{the strength of a}} participant's birthday-number effect was correlated to his or her name-letter effect, no such correlation was found in the thinking condition.|$|E

5|$|Queen Elizabeth II {{has long}} been {{associated}} with corgis. After a visit to Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath in 1933, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their family that <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> the Corgis owned by the Marquess. Their father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), purchased the Pembroke Corgi Rozavel Golden Eagle, from the Rozavel kennels in Surrey. It was renamed Dookie.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, Lundgren had {{relationships}} with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> Marbella {{so much that}} they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Fightstar are a British post-hardcore {{band from}} London, England that formed in 2003. The band is {{composed}} of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and co-vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Fightstar are known to incorporate metal, alternative rock, emo and other genres into their general post-hardcore sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former pop career with Busted. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut EP, <b>They</b> <b>Liked</b> You Better When You Were Dead, was a critical success.|$|E
5|$|In November of that year, Prost had {{a meeting}} with the head of Honda's R {{department}} and F1 racing program, Nobuhiko Kawamoto in Geneva. He expressed his feelings that Honda was giving Senna preferential treatment, and Kawamoto then confirmed Prost's fears, explaining that the Honda engineers were of a new generation, and that <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> Senna's panache and samurai-like driving. Kawamoto was able to convince Prost that he would work something out on the Honda end of the McLaren-Honda partnership for the 1989 season, but this was not to be.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 poll {{conducted}} by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and publicized just two days before Russia's flag day (22 August), 56% of respondents stated that they felt proud when hearing the national anthem. However, only 39% could recall {{the words of the}} first line of the anthem. This was an increase from 33% in 2007. According to the survey, between 34 and 36% could not identify the anthem's first line. Overall, only 25% of respondents said <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> the anthem.|$|E

5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> it so their concerns were addressed.|$|E
5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> it enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E
5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E

5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever <b>they</b> <b>liked.</b> For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E
5|$|Max and Steph become {{attracted}} to each other. Max plunges into grief and remorse for bringing estranged wife Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) {{into the lives}} of the people he cares about. Steph feels sorry for him and invites him out. Max tries to kiss her. Steph and Max began to misread each other and, even as they developed feelings for each other, assume there is no chance at a relationship. When Max took Tom to the safari park to see an elephant named Romeo, that Steph had sponsored for him, Steph found him and they finally told each other that <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> each other and agreed to get into a relationship. Tom initially disapproves of their relationship, but comes around to the idea.|$|E
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students to rate, {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{coverage}} is erratic, {{a direct result}} of the sources that Bewick consulted: his own knowledge of British animals, the available scholarly sources, combined with George Culley's 1786 Observations on Livestock and the antique John Caius's 1576 On English Dogs. Bewick had to hand the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman's account of his visit to the Cape of Good Hope on Cook's expedition of 1772 to 1776, and animals from the Southern Cape figure largely in the book. It was an energetic muddle, but it was at once greeted with enthusiasm by the British public. <b>They</b> <b>liked</b> the combination of vigorous woodcuts, simple and accurate descriptions, and all kinds of exotic animals alongside things they knew.|$|E
5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E
25|$|Inside is a {{large-scale}} on-stage experiment by Dimitris Papaioannou {{that took place}} in a room set inside the Pallas Theatre in central Athens. Inside this room, for twenty nights in the Spring of 2011, a simple series of movements documenting our daily return home was uniformly repeated by thirty performers in countless combinations and superimpositions. Six hours on stage with no beginning, middle or end.
