This is now {{the site of the}} Multnomah County Courthouse. In Portland, he was a promoter of the city and helped to get Canyon Road built to ensure the city would become the commercial center of Oregon. Chapman practiced law, and in October 1851 he was held in contempt of court by Oregon Supreme Court justice Orville C. Pratt. Chapman was ordered to be sent to jail in the county seat of Hillsboro for 20 days and disbarred, but never went <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> the order was revoked when Pratt was replaced on the court by justice Thomas Nelson. Chapman had accused Pratt of mistreating lawyers in an affidavit.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.|$|E

25|$|The most {{determined}} {{resistance to}} the Diem regime occurred outside the Diệu Đế Pagoda. As troops attempted to stretch a barbed wire barricade across the bridge leading to the pagoda, a large crowd of pro-Buddhist laypeople and anti-government protesters tore it down with their bare hands. The crowd then fought the heavily armed military personnel with rocks, sticks and their bare fists, throwing back the tear gas grenades that were aimed at them. After a five-hour battle, the military finally won control of the bridge at dawn by driving armored cars through the angry crowd. The defense of the bridge and Diệu Đế had left an estimated 30 dead and 200 wounded. Ten truckloads of bridge defenders were taken <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> an estimated 500 people were arrested in the city.

25|$|The IWW first {{attracted}} {{attention in}} Goldfield, Nevada in 1906 {{and during the}} Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Further fame was gained later that year, when they took their stand on free speech. The town of Spokane, Washington had outlawed street meetings, and arrested Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a Wobbly organizer, for breaking this ordinance. The response was simple but effective: when a fellow member was arrested for speaking, {{large numbers of people}} descended on the location and invited the authorities to arrest all of them, until it became too expensive for the town. In Spokane, over 500 people went <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> four people died. The tactic of fighting for free speech to popularize the cause and preserve the right to organize openly was used effectively in Fresno, Aberdeen, and other locations. In San Diego, although there was no particular organizing campaign at stake, vigilantes supported by local officials and powerful businessmen mounted a particularly brutal counter-offensive.|$|E

500|$|After season four, {{most of the}} {{original}} staff left the show. Before David Mirkin arrived to take over as showrunner for season five, Oakley, Weinstein, O'Brien and Dan McGrath were the only writers working {{on the show and}} spent a month mapping out most of the season's episodes. Oakley and Weinstein wrote several episodes for season five, penning the [...] "Terror at 5½ Feet" [...] segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV", [...] "$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)", [...] "Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy", the show's 100th episode [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] and [...] "Lady Bouvier's Lover". For season six they wrote [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", basing much of the episode on the Watergate scandal, in which they had a great interest, as well as [...] "Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy" [...] and [...] "Bart vs. Australia". For [...] "Bart vs. Australia", the writing staff wanted to produce an episode in which the Simpsons family traveled to a foreign country; they selected Australia because they thought that everyone in Australia had {{a good sense of humor}} and [...] "would get the jokes", with the episode being intentionally inaccurate. The episode proved somewhat controversial; some Australian fans said the episode was a mockery of their country. Shortly after it had aired, the Simpsons staff received over a hundred letters from Australians who were insulted by the episode. The pair wrote the two-part episode [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?", which was initially proposed by series creator Matt Groening. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go <b>to</b> <b>jail</b> <b>and</b> it could change the dynamic of the show.
