40|$|Line {{simplification}} is {{an important}} function in GIS and cartography and is widely used in commercial GIS software packages. Most line simplification algorithms require the user to supply a <b>tolerance</b> <b>value,</b> {{which is used to}} determine the extent to which simplification is to be applied [...] All simplification algorithms induce positional errors in the data set, because they produce a discrepancy between the original line and its simplified version. The amount of this error depends on both the <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> and the shape of the line. This is the reason that many researchers have focused on measuring the geometric characteristics (or complexity) of lines. Using one <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> for all lines in the data set results in different positional errors for different lines. What is usually important for the user, is to maintain a specific level of quality, and not the <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> itself. The question is, 'how does one specify a <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> for each line based on the user specified level of accuracy'? This paper presents a solution to solve this problem.

Fine sediment composition was characterized as the total amount (mg/cm 2), size distribution, and organic matter content of particles from 1. 5 to 250 microns in the upper streambed substrate. Macroinvertebrate assemblages differed among 7 sites spaced throughout 169 stream kilometers.

Promoter : Prof. Ace Suryadi, PhD, MSc. Co Promoter: Dr. H. Sunatra, SH, MS, Member: Dr. Elly Malihah, Msi. Juvenile {{delinquency}} such {{as student}} fighting have make the community felt anxious. That delinquency is student’s self expression {{which is caused}} by identity conflict. As for solution to overcome this student fighting case is telling story learning model on Civic Education lesson, through self application by internalisation of its <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> {{at the time the}} conflict happened that resulted in students fighting. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse the internalization of <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> through telling story model on Civic Education learning to overcome fighting problem among students of senior high school in Sukabumi. The approach which is used to reveal the problem is qualitative, with Grounded Theory from United Nations Development Programme Bureu For Development Policy Democratic Governance Group, through the set of data which is obtained through interview, observation toward several places such as: police station, school and MGMP, with bibliography documentation study and reference, with intention to minimize the fighting criminal among students; maintain the application of <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> internalization on Civic Education Learning even though there is opinion and character differences, because there is influence from environment as conflict trigger that resulted in students fighting. The result of finding show that (1) the factor which cause fighting among students is continually suspicion from one school to another school to revenge because there is history from its almamater which is impacted on next generation, so student fighting for them is solidarity toward their friend. Alternatively, internalization of <b>tolerance</b> <b>value</b> should instilled to students continually, particularly students who engage in fighting action; (2) Telling story model on Civic Education is influential, particularly in searching solution from thinking and opinion of knowledgeable and experienced people that is from Civic Education teacher. It is hoped that its application result can reduce criminality rate of juvenile delinquency such as student fighting. The recommendation of this study are: Overcoming the student fighting should started from parents, by showing attitude to become model and willing to give optimal and sincere attention to their children, so the process of searching self identity as part of citizen can make students to have something to hold on with in accord with Civic Education and it is hoped that the aim of its learning can achieve multi dimension intelligence level. Because of Civic Education material is concrete and its learning is knowledge based, so it is hoped that the process can direct to citizenship skill value, civic skills included capable to solve their own problems (civic disposition) ...|$|E
