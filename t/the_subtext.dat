Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E

40|$|Although {{many studies}} have been devoted {{to the role of}} music in the works of Thomas Mann, very little {{attention}} has been paid to this aspect in his novel Der Erwählte. This novel presents two main ideas, an ethical and an aesthetical one, which are connected with each other and with Mann’s critical attitude towards music, a criticism which he expressed in most of his works. Nevertheless, many remarks by Mann prove that he consciously strove for musicality in his writings, especially through textual stratification. The analysis of <b>the</b> <b>subtexts</b> of a fragment from Der Erwählte in this study serves to substantiate the argument that the fragment might be called ‘polyphonic’: <b>the</b> <b>subtexts</b> sound together simultaneously with the ‘supratext’, yet possess an identity of their own and form a harmonious entity. Mann’s ambiguous attitude towards music presented him with problems. The final discussion in this study deals with his attempts to resolve this dilemma...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} gendering {{processes in}} two distinct models of work organization. It {{is a widespread}} belief that, compared to hierarchical (Tayloristic) organizations, team-based work offers opportunities for a high quality of working life to {{a broader range of}} employees, both men and women. Our research, however, suggests that gender inequality is (re) produced in both settings and results from <b>the</b> so-called gender <b>subtext.</b> <b>The</b> gender <b>subtext</b> is <b>the</b> set of often concealed power-based processes (re) producing gender distinction in social practices through organizational and individual arrangements. We draw a comparison between <b>the</b> gender <b>subtext</b> of Tayloristic and team-based work organizations through a theoretical analysis, illustrated by empirical data concerning the functioning of <b>the</b> gender <b>subtext</b> in organizations in the Dutch banking sector. Taylorism and team-based work differ in their conceptualization of organization and job design, but, when it comes to <b>the</b> gender <b>subtext,</b> it is six of one and half a dozen of the other. We argue that in both approaches a gender <b>subtext</b> contributes to <b>the</b> emergence of different but gendered notions of the ‘disembodied worker’. In both cases the notion of the abstract worker is implicitly loaded with masculine connotations. This gender bias is supported by two factors influencing the gendering of jobs: the gender connotations of care responsibilities and of qualification profiles. These implicit connotations produce and reinforce unequal opportunities for men and women to get highly qualified or management jobs. Our research, therefore, questions the self-evidence of stating that team-based work will offer opportunities for a higher quality of working life for women...|$|R

500|$|The [...] fantasy {{television}} series introduced its main characters, Xena and Gabrielle, as close companions; fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons, although the lesbian content remained at <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> level. The series {{has been cited}} as [...] "trail-blazing" [...] and breaking down barriers, allowing the production of subsequent programming such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which introduced a number of LGBT characters. The most famous is the major character, Willow and her partners Tara and Kennedy. Although praised for their [...] "healthy relationship" [...] and being the first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime-time television, others criticised the use of witchcraft {{as a metaphor for}} lesbian sex. Tara's death directly after reconciliatory sex with Willow caused an outcry among the LGBT community, who saw it as a [...] "homophobic cliché". Andrew Wells, a recurring villain and eventual ally, was strongly implied to be gay, although closeted. The series was influential on subsequent television speculative fiction, including Torchwood.

500|$|According to Drew Miller of Stylus, {{the soundtrack}} [...] " [...] {{unconscious}} voice" [...] to the characters' psyches and complements <b>the</b> <b>subtext.</b> The most obvious use of pop music [...] "accompanies and gives context to" [...] Lester's attempts to recapture his youth; reminiscent {{of how the}} counterculture of the 1960s combated American repression through music and drugs, Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music. Mendes' song choices [...] "progress through the history of American popular music". Miller argues that although some may be over familiar, there is a parodic element at work, [...] "making good on [...] encouragement that viewers look closer". Toward {{the end of the}} film, Thomas Newman's score features more prominently, creating [...] "a disturbing tempo" [...] that matches the tension of the visuals. The exception is [...] "Don't Let It Bring You Down", which plays during Angela's seduction of Lester. At first appropriate, its tone clashes as the seduction stops. The lyrics, which speak of [...] "castles burning", {{can be seen as a}} metaphor for Lester's view of Angela—"the rosy, fantasy-driven exterior of the 'American Beauty—as it burns away to reveal [...] "the timid, small-breasted girl who, like his wife, has willfully developed a false public self".|$|E

500|$|The Great Silence {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by various film critics and historians as a subversion of various conventions of the Western film genre. Corbucci, a left-wing radical who made his political views either <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> or subject of several of his films, wrote the film's story as an allegory highlighting the corruptions stemming from authoritarian forms of capitalism, which are personified by the sadistic, greedy bounty killers led by Loco (who use the bounties to fuel their desires for violence and money while acting under the law), {{as well as the}} schemes of the banker Pollicutt. This is partially in line with the [...] "Classical Plot" [...] of both American Westerns (such as Shane) and certain Spaghetti Westerns (such as A Fistful of Dollars), in which, according to Will Wright, a [...] "lone stranger rides into a troubled town and cleans it up, winning the respect of the townsfolk and the love of the schoolmarm." [...] As a result of his sympathetic portrayal of the outlaws and the demoniac characterization of the people who hunt them, Corbucci's presentation of bounty killers is far more negative than such figures in Sergio Leone's films – the closing title card of The Great Silence contrasts with the opening title card of For a Few Dollars More.|$|E
500|$|The Infected, a core {{concept of}} the game, were {{inspired}} by {{a segment of the}} BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the {{concept of the}} fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus; Straley attributed this to the team's focus on the characters, as opposed to the virus. They preferred to explain the events through subtext, rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection. Straley compared <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite (2013). He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry, which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry. [...] "I've seen enough good stories in books and film. Now I want to see them in video games," [...] said Straley. The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance. Throughout development, the team assured everyone that the Infected were strictly different from zombies.|$|E

She saw the dead city as representing [...] "a system, an order, a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways." [...] In contrast, she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as [...] "more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome." [...] As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it, Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism; <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> is that [...] "in ransacking the Roman outpost, Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society". Fortunately for Morocco, [...] "the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition"—very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across.

2500|$|Ancient Greek {{religious}} texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. <b>The</b> <b>subtexts</b> varied, from <b>the</b> mystical to the didactic.

[...] Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song [...] "lethally catchy". Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons' 1980 song [...] "Can You Feel It".

500|$|Williams {{has stated}} that the game's events are open to interpretation. Many {{different}} theories have been discussed by the development staff. Davis described the game's pacing as [...] "deliberate", {{but he added that}} there are moments where the pacing slows down significantly and allows the player {{to learn more about the}} game's story through inspecting environmental objects. The city of Dubai is filled with graffiti, which is used to give players information regarding the factions and the backstory. According to Yager, the graffiti was designed to give players a perspective that is different from the main game, and to help make the location more realistic. The team also hoped to make players feel lost when playing the game. As a result, the team added hallucination to the game. The team hoped that by using hallucination as a plot device, they could create a snowball effect and engage players more fully in the story as they complete the game. These hallucinations sometimes occur through <b>the</b> <b>subtext,</b> in which players may not realize their presence. Williams added that having subtext is important, and that the [...] "best stories are the ones that have stuff hidden in them".

500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} feature live action footage {{in the game}} after {{becoming}} frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on [...] for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is [...] "very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling a lot of <b>the</b> <b>subtext</b> into her performance", which led him {{to believe that she}} was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering font size, as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role. Seifert began to feel pressure midway through filming, when she realised that [...] "the whole game is hinging" [...] on her performance. She described the shoot as [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "rather exhausting", and felt as if she was [...] "subtly being scrutinised" [...] by Barlow, which helped her performance. Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert's performance, taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock, who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance. Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have [...] "added some twists and turns" [...] for players that Barlow had not anticipated. The game's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days, in a process that Barlow called [...] "natural". Barlow travelled to Seifert's home county of Cornwall to film. He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production, because [...] "everywhere has crappy looking rooms", with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro. When filming was complete, Barlow wanted {{to give the impression that}} the videos had been recorded in 1994, but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately.
