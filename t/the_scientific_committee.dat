50|$|After {{reviewing}} its {{handling of}} the BSE crisis, the European Commission restructured its committees, replacing some and creating new committees. All of these committees were then overseen by <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> Steering <b>Committee</b> (formerly <b>the</b> Multi-disciplinary <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee),</b> which also handled some specific issues such as BSE. The responsibility for all of <b>the</b> advisory <b>scientific</b> <b>committees</b> was also transferred to DG XXIV, which dealt with Consumer Policy and Consumer Health Protection. This transfer was made to preserve the independence of those committees, by separating the tasks of expert advice from the direct policy and legislative parts of the Commission.|$|R

25|$|After the {{moratorium}} came into force in 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee</b> was commissioned {{to review the}} status of the whale stocks and develop a calculation method for setting safe catch limits. At the IWC's annual meeting in 1991, <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee</b> submitted its finding that there existed approximately 761,000 minke whales in Antarctic waters, 87,000 in the northeast Atlantic, and 25,000 in the North Pacific. With such populations, it was submitted, 2000 minke whales could be harvested annually without endangering the population. Despite this, the IWC Plenary Committee voted to maintain the blanket moratorium on whaling, arguing that formulas for determining allowable catches had not yet been adequately evaluated.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, {{acting on}} the {{recommendation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee,</b> the IWC adopted a computerized formula, the Revised Management Procedure (RMP), for determining allowable catches of some whale species.
