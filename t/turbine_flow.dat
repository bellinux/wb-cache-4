These approaches are based on the notions of adaptive methods and smart algorithms, which use instantaneous measures of the quality and other features of the numerical flowfields as a basis for making changes {{in the structure of the}} computational grid and of algorithms designed to function on the grid. The application of these new techniques to several problem classes are addressed, including problems with moving boundaries, fluid-structure interaction in high-speed <b>turbine</b> <b>flows,</b> flow in domains with receding boundaries, and related problems...|$|R

The multi-block capability of the code makes it particularly useful for the complex geometries of such flows. One of the goals of the UEET program is to reduce <b>turbine</b> cooling <b>flow</b> while increasing <b>turbine</b> inlet temperature. The Glenn-HT code gives researchers a tool to analyze the flow within the very complicated geometries associated with actual cooled turbine designs.

The condensate is then pumped through feedwater heaters that raise its temperature using extraction steam from various turbine stages.

50|$|The engine needs {{compressed}} air for itself just to run successfully. This air comes {{from its own}} compressor and is called secondary air. It does not contribute to making thrust so makes the engine less efficient. It is used to preserve the mechanical integrity of the engine, to stop parts overheating and to prevent oil escaping from bearings for example. Only some of this air taken from the compressors returns to the <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> to contribute to thrust production. Any reduction in the amount needed improves the engine efficiency. Again, it will be known for a particular engine design that a reduced requirement for cooling flow of x% will reduce the specific fuel consumption by y%. In other words, less fuel {{will be required to}} give take-off thrust, for example. The engine is more efficient.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turbine</b> <b>flow</b> meters {{are used}} for the {{measurement}} of natural gas and liquid flow. Turbine meters are less accurate than displacement and jet meters at low flow rates, but the measuring element does not occupy or severely restrict the entire path of flow. The flow direction is generally straight through the meter, allowing for higher flow rates and less pressure loss than displacement-type meters. They are the meter of choice for large commercial users, fire protection, and as master meters for the water distribution system. Strainers are generally required to be installed {{in front of the}} meter to protect the measuring element from gravel or other debris that could enter the water distribution system. Turbine meters are generally available for 4 to 30 cm (-12 in) or higher pipe sizes. Turbine meter bodies are commonly made of bronze, cast Iron, or ductile iron. Internal turbine elements can be plastic or non-corrosive metal alloys. They are accurate in normal working conditions but are greatly affected by the flow profile and fluid conditions.|$|E
50|$|Sequential turbos {{refer to}} a set-up in which the motor uses one {{turbocharger}} for lower engine speeds, and a second or both turbochargers at higher engine speeds. Typically, larger high-flow turbochargers are not as efficient at low RPM, resulting in lower intake manifold pressures under these conditions. On the other hand, smaller turbos spool up quickly at low RPM but cannot supply enough air at higher engine speed. During low to mid engine speeds, when available spent exhaust energy is minimal, only one relatively small turbocharger (called the primary turbocharger) is active. During this period, all of the engine's exhaust energy is directed to the primary turbocharger only, providing the small turbo's benefits of a lower boost threshold, minimal turbo lag, and increased power output at low engine speeds. As RPM increases, the secondary turbocharger is partially activated in order to pre-spool prior to its full utilization. Once a preset engine speed or boost pressure is attained, valves controlling compressor and <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> through the secondary turbocharger are opened completely. (The primary turbocharger is deactivated {{at this point in}} some applications.) In this way a full twin-turbocharger setup provides the benefits associated with a large turbo, including maximum power output, without the disadvantage of increased turbo lag.|$|E

To predict the characteristics between the output frequency and flow in the nonlinear range, the <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> sensor model was built.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years the demand of energy from {{renewable}} sources {{has been increasing}} due to increased environmental awareness and foreseeable shortage of non-renewable energies. This has had a strong impact on wind energy powerplants. In fact in order to supply large quantities of energy high-density clusters of wind turbines have been designed. However, the actual production has been lower than the expected because of wake interactions, which are more severe as more densely the turbines are placed, and turbulent motion. It follows {{that in order to}} optimize the power extraction from wind a deep understanding of wakes features and dynamics is required. Historically employed engineering models do not provide such a detailed knowledge and their predictions on wakes characteristics may be quite erroneous due the simplifying assumptions they rely upon. Conversely Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) take into account the dynamics of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>flows</b> without making a priori hypotheses on airflow behaviour. Therfore LES results are expected to be more detailed and accurate. In the present thesis, LES of wind <b>turbine</b> <b>flows</b> have been performed.

As an important flow meter, turbine meter is widely used in many fields for its high accuracy, good repeatability, small size and light weight.
