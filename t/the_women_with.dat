5|$|Among {{those with}} whom Vaughan Williams became {{friendly}} at Cambridge were the philosophers G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, the historian G. M. Trevelyan and the musician Hugh Allen. He felt intellectually overshadowed by some of his companions, but he learned much from them and formed lifelong friendships with several. Among <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher, the daughter of Herbert Fisher, {{an old friend of}} the Vaughan Williams family. She and Vaughan Williams grew close, and in June 1897, after he had left Cambridge, they became engaged to be married.|$|E
5|$|He {{also took}} to the streets in a mobile clinic, driving to parks and out to the suburbs with other psychoanalysts and physicians. Reich would talk to the {{teenagers}} and men, while a gynaecologist fitted <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> contraceptive devices, and Lia Laszky, the woman Reich fell in love with at medical school, spoke to the children. They also distributed sex-education pamphlets door to door.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that she was one of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying {{to get in touch with}} her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E

25|$|The House of Lords {{has also}} been {{targeted}} by protesters. On 2February 1988, the House debated the Local Government Bill's controversial Clause 28, a measure to prohibit the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Following the division, in which the clause passed, a number of lesbian demonstrators in the public gallery started chanting slogans, and three of them tied ropes to the railing and climbed down onto {{the floor of the}} Chamber. Lord Monkswell, who had provided <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> passes to attend the debate, later apologised to the House for the incident but did not criticise the protest.|$|E
25|$|The job {{training}} of women was so completely {{integrated with the}} entire AAF training program that virtually no separate statistics are available {{as a basis for}} comparing the record of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> male trainees. Obviously, this policy meant that the Wacs had to be as well qualified as men to enroll in and graduate from a training course. It is known only that approximately 2,000 women completed courses in AAF technical schools, including those for Link-trainer instructors, airplane mechanics, sheet-metal workers, weather forecasters, weather observers, electrical specialists of several kinds, teletype operators, control-tower specialists, cryptographers, radio mechanics, parachute riggers, bombsight-maintenance specialists, clerks, photo-laboratory technicians, and photo-interpreters.|$|E
25|$|According to the Oraon, {{the most}} evil Churels have their eyes sewn up with thorns and {{their hands and}} legs are broken.

The Gonds of Southern Mandla protect themselves from Churels “by tying down the corpse of a woman who dies in childbed with the child surviving”. The Bhumia, who are highly suspicious of witchcraft, rest <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> their faces down to stop them from returning as Churels, while men are laid to rest on their backs.|$|E

25|$|Rogers' {{volunteer}} work in World War I exposed {{her to the}} status of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> the United States Army, and the much more egalitarian role of women in the British Army. With this inspiration and model, Edith Rogers introduced a bill to the 76th Congress in early 1941 to establish a Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) during World War II. The bill was intended to free men for combat duty by creating a cadre of 25,000 noncombatant clerical workers. The bill languished in the face of strong opposition to women in the army, and indifference in the face of higher priorities like the lend-lease bill, price controls, and ramping up war production.|$|E
25|$|O'Keeffe {{traveled}} to New Mexico by 1929 {{with her friend}} Rebecca Strand and stayed in Taos {{at the home of}} Mabel Dodge Luhan, who provided <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> studios. O'Keeffe went on many pack trips, exploring the rugged mountains and deserts of the region that summer and later visited the nearby D. H. Lawrence Ranch, where she completed her now famous oil painting, The Lawrence Tree, currently owned by the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut. O'Keeffe visited and painted the nearby historical San Francisco de Asis Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos. She made several paintings of the church, as had many artists, and her painting of a fragment of it silhouetted against the sky captured it from a unique perspective.|$|E
25|$|From 1906 until mid-1914, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom was {{the party}} seen as most {{supportive}} of women's suffrage—the right {{of women to}} vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women. In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict. Millicent Garrett Fawcett of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting {{them the right to}} vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).|$|E

25|$|Shape - The third episode {{features}} Trinny and Susannah {{exploring the}} theme of shape, where they promote wearing clothes suitable to body shape rather than clothing size. Trinny and Susannah get 60 size 16 women to wear an identical size 16 dress in order to discover how many women the dress fits properly. They find that the dress only fits two women, despite all 60 being classed as a size 16. To explore how women see their own bodies, the duo take their pink box in which women can draw their impressions of themselves, finding that they all see their bodies in different shapes. Then 60 of the women from the investigation are introduced to 12 different objects which Trinny and Susannah believe can represent all women's body shapes. The shapes include 'apple', 'hourglass', 'skittle', 'vase', 'cornet', 'lollipop', 'column', 'bell', 'goblet', 'cello', 'pear' and 'brick'. The different objects are displayed around a gallery where twelve women with tightly fitted outfits, to show their figures clearly, stand next to the object which they best represent to demonstrate the general idea. Each model is then given a makeover {{according to the rules}} which Trinny and Susannah have applied to each body shape. The rest of the women are then required to go shopping to buy themselves clothes, complying with the rules. Only <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> the correct shape clothes receive their money back. Also around the town are the 12 live manikins, standing by a list of the rules for their body shape.|$|E

500|$|Rodríguez Vergara {{observes that}} the General {{is like a}} supernatural being, {{simultaneously}} dying and being surrounded by symbolic circumstances such as rain, fiestas, and the plague. The novel begins with Bolívar immersed in purifying waters, {{in a state of}} ecstasy and meditation that suggests a priestly ritual. One of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> whom the General sleeps, Queen Marie Louise, is described as a virgin with the profile of an idol—an allusion to the Virgin Mary. The General rides a mule into the last towns on his journey towards death, echoing Christ's entry into Jerusalem. He dies of mysterious and unknown causes, and the people burn his belongings in fear of catching his illness. In Rodríguez Vergara's view, [...] "Bolívar was sacrificed as a scapegoat to purge the guilt of the community." ...|$|E
500|$|Not until news of {{the victory}} at San Jacinto spread did the {{refugees}} return to their homesteads and businesses, or whatever was left after the destruction caused by both armies. Throughout Texas, possessions had been abandoned and later looted. Businesses, homes and farms were wiped out by the devastation of war. Often {{there was nothing left}} to go back to, but those who went home began to pick up their lives and move forward. San Felipe de Austin never really recovered from its total destruction. The few people who returned there moved elsewhere, sooner or later. Secretary of War Rusk would later commend the women of Texas who held their families together during the flight, while their men volunteered to fight: [...] "The men of Texas deserve much credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe could not but be brave; but <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> <b>with</b> their little children around them, without means of defense or power to resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage." ...|$|E
500|$|In any case, {{during her}} time in Montreal, Cadron-Jetté made the {{acquaintance}} of Ignace Bourget, Bishop of the Diocese of Montreal. She met Bourget through her attendance at Saint Jacques Cathedral, where he became her spiritual director. Cadron-Jetté joined his Archiconfrérie du Très Saint et Immaculé Coeur de Marie, a group formed by Bourget to pray for the conversion of sinners. Beginning in 1840, Bourget began to call upon Cadron-Jetté to find crisis accommodation for unwed mothers who had approached him for confession and help. This accommodation was to be secret, as unwed mothers carried a significant social stigma {{at the time and}} were often the targets of hostility, and it was to be [...] "with a kind and prayerful woman". Cadron-Jetté undertook this work, and between 1840 and 1845 helped around 25 women during their pregnancy, childbirth, and recovery. She would often place <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> her (now-independent) children, and sometimes offered the women accommodation in her own home. [...] After the birth of each child, Cadron-Jetté would take the newborn to be baptised at Montreal's Notre Dame church, and stand as godmother for the child.|$|E
