40|$|Abstract—Differentiated service (DiffServ) {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to assure the achievable minimum bandwidth to aggregate flows. However, analyses in the literature show that the current DiffServ networks are biased {{in favor of an}} aggregate flow that has a smaller committed information rate (CIR) when aggregate flows with different CIRs share a bottleneck link. In order to mitigate this unfairness problem, we propose an adaptive marking scheme which provides the relative bandwidth assurance in proportion to the CIRs of the aggregates. By introducing a virtual target rate (VTR) and adjusting it depending on the provision level of the network, each aggregate can obtain its <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of the bandwidth, regardless of traffic load. This scheme is based on a feedback approach. It utilizes only two-bit feedback information conveyed in the packet header and can be implemented in a distributed manner. Furthermore, the proposed scheme does not require calculating <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> of aggregates or any additional signaling protocol. Using steady state analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the scheme can provide aggregate flows with <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> of bandwidth, which is proportional to the CIRs, under various network conditions.

40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} are widely considered nowadays {{one of the}} main causes for global climate change. Every product's supply chain consists of several energy usage processes. Three new approaches (end-userpays; production based; and profit based) regarding the allocation of the cost related to the carbon footprint (CF) produced, among producers and users are being presented. These approaches vary according to the 'blame' attached to each stakeholder involved, during the several phases of the 'product's' life cycle. According to the first approach, CO 2 emissions occur as the need for the product/service exists. The second approach allocates the CF production-related cost in each step of the supply chain according to not only how much of this CF is produced in each step, but considering also the CF produced in the previous steps. The allocation follows the profit rate (profit/selling price) of each step of the supply chain. At the third approach, the profit rate used {{has to do with the}} profit of each step compared to the total profit of the entire supply chain.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} packet-drop mechanisms in conjunction with fair queuing link scheduling and hierarchical link <b>sharing.</b> Under <b>fair</b> queuing, the link share of a flow changes dynamically due to the arrivals and departures of flows and their bursts. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced {{in the case of}} hierarchical link sharing. Packet-drop mechanisms play an integral role for bandwidth-adaptive flows, such as TCP, that are expected to adjust their rates to the flows' changing <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of the link bandwidth. We show experimentally that, under the existing drop policies (including random early detection and per-flow schemes such as the longest queue drop) implemented with fair scheduling policies, TCP flows are slow to adjust their rates to their changing share of the link bandwidth. To overcome this problem, we propose a new packet-drop policy that simultaneously exploits two dimensions [...] when to drop and what to drop. We demonstrate that, under our packet-drop policy and with fair queuing, TCP flows adapt to <b>their</b> changing <b>fair</b> <b>share</b> of the link bandwidth when competing with di erent types of cross-traffic (e. g., bandwidth adaptive, rate controlled, greedy and on-off).

50|$|According to Robert Trivers’s {{theory on}} relatedness, each {{offspring}} {{is related to}} itself by 1, but is only 0.5 related to their parents and siblings. Genetically, offspring are predisposed to behave in their own self-interest while parents are predisposed to behave equally to all their offspring, including both current and future ones. Offspring will selfishly attempt to take more than <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> <b>shares</b> of parental investment while parents will attempt to spread out their parental investment equally amongst their present young and future young.There are many examples of parent-offspring conflict in nature. One manifestation of this is asynchronous hatching in birds. A behavioral ecology hypothesis is known as Lack's brood reduction hypothesis (named after David Lack). Lack's hypothesis posits an evolutionary and ecological explanation as to why birds lay a series of eggs with an asynchronous delay leading to nestlings of mixed age and weights. According to Lack, this brood behavior is an ecological insurance that allows the larger birds to survive in poor years and all birds to survive when food is plentiful. We also see sex-ratio conflict between the queen and her workers in social hymenoptera. Because of haplodiploidy, the workers (offspring) prefer a 3:1 female to male sex allocation while the queen prefers a 1:1 sex ratio. Both the queen and the workers will attempt to bias the sex ratio in their favor. In some species, the workers {{gain control of the}} sex ratio, while in other species, like B. terrestris, the queen has a considerable amount of control over the colony sex ratio. Lastly, there has been recent evidence regarding genomic imprinting that is a result of parent-offspring conflict. Paternal genes in offspring will demand more maternal resources than maternal genes in the same offspring and vice versa. This has been show in imprinted genes like insulin-like growth factor-II.|$|R
