500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There was a knock at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon {{attended}} a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who {{was playing with}} Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I walked in <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard them playing, {{it was like a}} revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
60|$|So in I went. Mother Goose herself opened <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> was.|$|R
60|$|While I {{was in her}} house, {{which was}} near four months, she had no less than twelve ladies of {{pleasure}} brought to bed within <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think she had two-and-thirty, or thereabouts, under her conduct without doors, whereof one, as nice as she was with me, was lodged with my old landlady at St. Jones's.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} person outside <b>the</b> <b>door</b> coughed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hastened to open it, for I knew the cough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Satisfy your curiosity, Mr. Linwood, by all means," [...] Charlotte {{answered}} {{in the same}} tone. [...] "Open <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will follow you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean that}} when I {{was a student}} at college, feeding on four dollars a week, this {{opportunity}} was knocking at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> missed it?" ...|$|E
60|$|A tapping came at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{heard the}} glutinous accents of M'ling speaking. I {{pocketed}} {{one of the}} revolvers (keeping one hand upon it), and opened to him.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Farrell {{discussed}} his aborted {{plans for a}} Satellite Party play, stating, [...] "I was actually working on something, a project {{a couple of years}} ago, that was actually a Satellite Party. It had to do with <b>The</b> <b>Doors.</b> I even got to produce a song, a previous unproduced and unrecorded song, by <b>The</b> <b>Doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do this beautiful play called “The Satellite Party” in Vegas. It didn’t work out." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} again. She went to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called, <b>I</b> {{following}} her with my eyes. Lindy {{came with a}} bowl of water.|$|R
50|$|Meen tai tuun, paan oven kii ja oon hiljaa ("I go or come, (<b>I)</b> put <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closed <b>and</b> (<b>I)</b> am quiet").|$|R
60|$|She {{looked back}} at us from <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a last {{impression}} of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.|$|E
60|$|The barking of the {{vigilant}} dogs {{had drawn}} me instantly to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember how positively certain I then felt that Sidney had kissed Mariposilla during her groundward journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "O," [...] said Rollo, laughing, [...] "I {{never thought}} of that. Go down, Nathan," [...] he continued, [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will go round and knock out the fid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{the dismal}} evening, and--and everything,' said Affery. 'And here! The wind has been <b>and</b> blown <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't get in.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} <b>the</b> {{warehouse}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{saw that it}} was now open and that a man was standing upon the threshold. I turned towards him doubtfully.|$|R
6000|$|Can I go no nearer, never towards <b>the</b> <b>door?</b> <b>The</b> ghosts <b>and</b> <b>I</b> we mourn together, and shrink In {{the shadow}} of the cart-shed. Must we hover on [...] the brink Forever, and never enter the {{homestead}} any more? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{be safer}} and quieter {{while you are}} sitting. I heard a knock at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not doubt that it is Clara. She said she would be here." ...|$|E
6000|$|He moved vaguely towards <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> followed. But I turned yet {{once more}} in the toils of my {{conscience}} and curiosity. [...] "Can we do nothing for you, madam?" [...] I said forlornly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} mean enough," [...] she answered, [...] "to listen at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{heard you talking}} of your father. I {{want to hear more}} about him. That is why I came in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Rollo, [...] "and {{we must go}} out <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't care much," [...] he continued, [...] "for it {{is pretty}} near dinner time." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> opened, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> looked, half {{laughing}} and half crying in my pleasant agitation, for my mother. It was not she, but a strange servant.|$|R
6000|$|... "'We've got to skip,' I {{whispered to}} him, putting my mouth {{close to the}} crack of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> before <b>I</b> could get away he cried, oh! so mournfully: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Open {{the door}} for one moment, that you may listen to me. Open <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will tell you all. I will go {{instantly}} when I have spoken to you, Linda; I will indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was not sparing of {{strength}} when he thrust me back {{from him as}} he began to unbar <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would have hindered him; but said as I staggered against the wall almost overthrown: ...|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} {{there was a knock}} at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hurried out. The postmaster's boy was there with a telegram. I tore it open, glanced at it, and dashed back into the room.|$|E
60|$|WISE MAN [in a low, solemn voice]. Just now, {{before you}} came in, some one came to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> looked up I saw an angel {{standing}} there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, excuse me," [...] said he. He reopened <b>the</b> {{bathroom}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> took {{my finger}} {{out of the}} crack of it. After I had performed the marvellous digito-nasal feat I said: ...|$|R
5000|$|Bragg has {{admitted}} his Olympic disappointment lives with him - when watching the 100 m [...] "I cried," [...] Bragg said. [...] "I had successes; {{that was the}} major disappointment.

[...] He has described his 1952 injury as a total fluke - whilst on the warmup strip [...] "Someone opened one of <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made a quick motion to my left to avoid hitting it [...] [...] [...] oops, the hamstring went.".|$|R
60|$|I {{was soon}} {{within sight of}} Mr. Peggotty's house, and of the light within it shining through the window. A little floundering across the sand, which was heavy, brought me to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went in.|$|E
6000|$|So I wrote: [...] "I {{put it in}} the coffin. It was {{in there}} when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{it came to}} me what it was {{the gentleman}} had been saying to me: [...] "I say, sir, you with the bit of wood in your mouth, you have been and shut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't get in." ...|$|E
60|$|Rosy. Efacks, I can do nothing, but there's the German quack, {{whom you}} wanted to send from town; I met him at <b>the</b> next <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know he has antidotes for all poisons.|$|R
6000|$|... "Garny, old horse," [...] he said, [...] "freeze {{onto the}} handle of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and,</b> when <b>I</b> give <b>the</b> word, fling wide the gates. Then watch that animal get the {{surprise}} of a lifetime." ...|$|R
