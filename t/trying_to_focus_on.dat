The promotion {{of democracy and}} harmonised inter-ethnic relations had been defined as the main goal of the new state. Since the first democratic elections in 1991, the Albanians in Macedonia used all constitutional and political opportunities to play a significant political role in the country. There were several Albanian political parties, whose behaviour and rhetoric (just {{as in the case}} with the parties of the Macedonian political block), depended on whether they were in the governing coalition or not. Despite these political fluctuations, the Albanian parties were included as coalition partners in all post-communist Macedonian governments.|$|E

There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position.
