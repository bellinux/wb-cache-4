500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office <b>thinks</b> <b>so</b> as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does not think it is anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E
500|$|Rumours {{has been}} {{acclaimed}} by music critics since its release. Robert Christgau, reviewing in The Village Voice, gave the album an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as}} [...] "more consistent and more eccentric" [...] than its predecessor. He added that it [...] "jumps {{right out of the}} speakers at you". Rolling Stone magazine's John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album's most pleasing elements; he stated, [...] "Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record, Rumours proves that the success of Fleetwood Mac was no fluke." [...] In a review for The New York Times, John Rockwell said the album is [...] "a delightful disk, and one hopes the public <b>thinks</b> <b>so,</b> too", while Dave Marsh of the St. Petersburg Times claimed the songs are [...] "as grandly glossy as anything right now". Robert Hilburn was less receptive and called Rumours a [...] "frustratingly uneven" [...] record in his review for the Los Angeles Times, while Juan Rodriguez of The Gazette suggested that, while the music is [...] "crisper and clearer", Fleetwood Mac's ideas are [...] "slightly more muddled". The album finished fourth in The Village Voices 1977 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{analysed}} {{the role}} of terrorism in the novel. Patrick Reilly calls the novel [...] "a terrorist text {{as well as a}} text about terrorism" [...] due to Conrad's manipulation of chronology to allow the reader to comprehend the outcome of the bombing before the characters, thereby corrupting the traditional conception of time. The morality which is implicit in these acts of terrorism has also been explored: is Verloc evil because his negligence leads to the death of his brother-in-law? Although Winnie evidently <b>thinks</b> <b>so,</b> the issue is not clear, as Verloc attempted to carry out the act with no fatalities, and as simply as possible to retain his job, and care for his family.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{appearing}} {{regularly for}} England in FIFA World Cup qualifying matches and friendly matches, Defoe was not {{named in the}} provisional England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany and named only on a five-man standby list. He joined the squad for training in Germany, but returned to England when Wayne Rooney was cleared to play after having suffered a foot injury in April. He confessed that he was baffled by his omission, saying, [...] "I've been involved in every squad {{for the last two}} years and feel I've played a part in helping us to qualify. I have never felt fitter and sharper than I was in training and believe I could have scored goals in the tournament. It's a strange decision and everybody I speak to <b>thinks</b> <b>so</b> as well." [...] Eriksson explained why Defoe was not selected for the England squad: [...] "Jermain had a very bad season. I don't think he deserved to go to the World Cup." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{official}} cover (standard version) {{was revealed}} on February 29, 2012. The cover art {{was shot in}} January {{of the same year}} by Steven Gomillion and Dennis Leupold of the photography team, Gomillion and Leupold. On the album cover, a light shines down on Brown, who poses against a blue backdrop, dressed in a blue [...] "sleek, slim-fitting suit with a skinny tie and thick black framed glasses", while the word [...] "Fortune" [...] appears behind him in different languages. Brown and his art director Courtney Walter {{came up with the idea}} of using hieroglyphics for the album's title. In an interview by telephone with Erik Parker of CBS Local, Gomillion said Brown [...] "knew before the last album came out what this one would look like. He <b>thinks</b> <b>so</b> far ahead". Regarding the use of the color blue, Gomillion said [...] "The funny thing about that blue is it basically just happened. It matched the suit and it gives a kind of futuristic vibe. You'll see blue throughout the [...] packaging". Sarah Brotherton of MTV News wrote that the cover shows [...] "a more mature, sleek side" [...] to Brown. Becky Bain of Idolator noted that Brown [...] "seems to have finally dropped his beloved graffiti imagery and is going for a futuristic vibe". A reviewer for Rap-Up described it as a [...] "slick cover". Alex Loinaz of E! Online compared Brown's look to that of actors Keanu Reeves in The Matrix films, and Colin Firth in A Single Man (2009).|$|E
