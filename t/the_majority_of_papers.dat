50|$|After 1996, {{adaptive}} hypermedia grew rapidly. Research teams commenced {{projects in}} adaptive hypermedia, and many students selected the subject area for their PhD theses. A book on adaptive hypermedia, {{and a special}} issue of the New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (1998) were published. Two main factors accounted for this growth. Due a diverse audience, the internet boosted research into adaptivity. Almost all the papers published before 1996 describe classic pre-Web hypertext and hypermedia; <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> published since 1996 are devoted to Web-based adaptive hypermedia systems. The second factor was is the accumulation and consolidation of research experience in the field. Early papers provided few references to similar work in adaptive hypermedia, and described original laboratory systems developed to demonstrate and explore innovative ideas. After 1996, papers cite earlier work, and usually suggest either real world systems, or research systems developed for real world settings by elaborating or an extending techniques suggested earlier. This {{is indicative of the}} relative maturity of adaptive hypermedia as a research direction.|$|E

50|$|In May 1899, the {{newspaper}} followed a proven publicity and readership recruitment model by organising the Tour de France Automobile {{in conjunction with}} the Automobile Club de France. The newspaper's price rose to 5 centimes, like <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> in this era, and its number of pages rose from 4 to 6. The same year the businessman Maurice Bunau-Varilla, at first one of the paper's shareholders, joined its board of directors, becoming its president in 1901. Borne along by effective advertising, by the catchy tone of its articles and its brave reporting, Le Matin continued to increase its circulation, from 100,000 copies in 1900 to around 700,000 in 1910 and more than a million around 1914. Le Matin was thus one of the four biggest daily French newspapers in the period before World War I, employing 150 journalists such as Gaston Leroux, Michel Zevaco and Albert Londres, along with 500 technicians and other workers. Félix Fénéon's Nouvelles en trois lignes appeared anonymously throughout the paper in 1906. In 1918, it made the first recorded use of jazband (French for a jazz band), and was subsequently cited in both Über englisches Sprachgut im Französischen and Grand Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Française although they mis-typed the date as 1908. Also in the inter-war period the paper had the Russian-exile cartoonist Alex Gard on its staff.|$|E

40|$|The {{philosophical}} {{study of}} {{mind in the}} twentieth century was dominated by a research program that used a priori methods to address foundational questions. Since that time, however, the philosophical study of mind has undergone a dramatic shift. To provide a more accurate picture of contemporary philosophical work, I compared a sample of highly cited philosophy papers from the past five years with a sample of highly cited philosophy papers from the twentieth century. In the twentieth century sample, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> used purely a priori methods, while only a minority cited results from empirical studies. In the sample from the past five years, the methodology is radically different. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> cite results from empirical studies, a sizable proportion report original experimental results, and only a small minority are purely a priori. Overall, the results of the review suggest that the philosophical study of mind has become considerably more integrated into the broader interdisciplinary field of cognitive science...|$|E

40|$|Research {{into social}} media has proliferated {{significantly}} {{over the last}} few years.

This paper provides a report on a systematic literature search of social media research papers in major Information Systems (IS) outlets including journals and conferences from January 2009 to January 2013. The survey of literature indicates that there is a continuous {{increase in the number of}} social media research articles published {{over the last few}} years. Furthermore, we found that <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> were data driven and not theory driven and a greater number of papers were published in conferences than in journals. In summary, we suggest that research into social media has been emerging over a period of time and there are numerous opportunities for researchers to conduct rigorous studies in this area. Moreover, it is anticipated that the review presented in this paper will be a good resource for future research into social media and will stimulate further interest in this area...|$|E
