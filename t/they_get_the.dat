When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. <b>They</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} transport, {{they are}} {{surprised}} when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> car to the target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop {{the part of the}} road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to Union Station.|$|E

25|$|Like most Germanic languages, Dutch forms noun compounds, {{where the}} first noun modifies the {{category}} given by the second (hondenhok = doghouse). Unlike English, where newer compounds or combinations of longer nouns are often written in open form with separating spaces, Dutch (like the other Germanic languages) either uses the closed form without spaces (boomhut = tree house) or inserts a hyphen (VVD-coryfee = outstanding member of the VVD, a political party). Like German, Dutch allows arbitrarily long compounds, but the longer <b>they</b> <b>get,</b> <b>the</b> less frequent they tend to be.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} is using this model as a scam, the {{confidence}} trickster would take {{the majority of the}} money. They would do this by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> first seven payouts, at eight times the buy-in sum, without paying a single penny themselves. So if the buy-in were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme {{for as long as possible}} to allow them to skim even more from it before it collapses.|$|E

25|$|The {{president}} is elected in {{a majority vote}} if the voter turnout is at least 50%. If the voter turnout is less than 50%, the candidate is declared a winner only if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> votes of at least 1/3 of all eligible voters. If {{there are more than}} two candidates and no candidate wins in the first round, a second round of voting is held on a Sunday no more than two weeks after the first round. The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting and the candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner. If two or fewer candidates stand for election and none manage to win in the first round, a new election is held no more than three months after the election date.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, they assume that regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary benefits <b>they</b> <b>get,</b> <b>the</b> more they prefer the ruling class. Fourth, people care not only about redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also they want to see a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E

25|$|Hypokalaemia, {{a genetic}} disease which is {{characterized}} by low serum potassium levels, has also {{been seen in the}} British Burmese and can similarly be traced to certain bloodlines. The gene is recessive, and both parents must carry it for the kittens to develop the problem. A carrier mated to a non-carrier may pass the problem on unnoticed for several generations. Clinical signs include skeletal muscle weakness, which is often episodic in nature and either affects the whole cat or is localised to the neck muscles. As a consequence the cat can have difficulty in walking and holding their head correctly. In extreme cases, the clinical symptoms can result in death if unattended medically. Hypokalaemic cats can usually lead a normal life if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> correct potassium supplement. Onset of symptoms often occurs around puberty and many may never experience another attack. A DNA test is now available to identify cats affected by or carrying this recessive gene.|$|E
25|$|Night jumpers {{should be}} made aware of the dark zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have {{a good view of the}} landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower <b>they</b> <b>get,</b> <b>the</b> darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations {{should be made}} to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.|$|E
25|$|Interior {{space is}} limited, and divers {{generally}} travel and kit up while {{sitting on the}} tubes opposite a central cylinder rack where the fully rigged scuba sets are stowed. Water entry is commonly by simultaneous rolling backwards over the side, {{and return to the}} boat by climbing back in over the tubes one at a time after removing the heavy parts of the diving equipment and handing it up to the crew. Some boats have ladders which hook over the tubes to make boarding easier for the less athletic diver, others rely on assistance from the crew. An advantage of this type of boat compared with similar-sized rigid boats is that the inflated tubes make the boat very stable during the entry and exit of the divers and if the boat is filled with water during surf transit maneuvers. These boats are usually fairly fast, maneuverable, seaworthy in surf and rough conditions, and relatively uncomfortable. They seldom provide any shelter from the elements, and their advantages are that <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> diver to the site and back fairly quickly, are generally good for operation through surf, are usually trailerable and can be launched at slipways and beaches.|$|E
