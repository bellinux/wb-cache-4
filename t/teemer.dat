5000|$|The {{park was}} the first in the St. Louis County Park system and was {{dedicated}} in 1945. Originally a resort, [...] Creve Coeur Lake, which is 320 acre, had hosted many boating events decades before the park officially opened. In June 1882, the Mississippi Valley regatta was held at the lake. It also hosted the Creve Coeur Regatta and the Annual Races of the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen in 1904 (the rowing competition for the 1904 Summer Olympics), and it was the site where local sculler Jacob Gaudaur often competed, including his victory over John <b>Teemer</b> in a sculling match in 1884. Gaudaur was married to a resident of Creve Coeur, Cora Coons. A smaller, 66 acre lake, called Mallard Lake, was constructed with the bridge project.|$|E
50|$|The next defence {{was against}} Australian Neil Matterson {{which took place}} on 18 December 1885 on the Parramatta. This time the stake was only £200 a side. Beach took the lead at the start and won easily and without a great effort.On 27 March 1886 Beach left for London and in August won {{the final of the}} International Sweepstake, against John <b>Teemer,</b> Bubear, Lee and others on the Thames for a prize of £1200. On 18 September 1886 he {{successfully}} defended his title against Jake Gaudaur Snr. on the Championship Course on the Thames for £1000. That course was a little longer than the Parramatta course, being about four and a quarter miles long. This was also an interesting race in that race each rower in turn stopped from exhaustion and slumped in his boat. Beach managed to recover sufficiently to continue rowing a won the race in 22m.29s. On 25 September 1886 Beach was again out on the Thames rowing against Wallace Ross for £1000 and the World Championship. It was most unusual to have title matches this close together as often many months would go by between races. The result was never in doubt and Beach won easily.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, after {{a disappointing}} {{season in the}} double, O’Connor began to {{concentrate}} on the single. Within a short time he had won so many regattas in such fast times - his 19 minutes and 43 seconds for three miles with one turn in August 1888 was considered a world record - that few would accept his challenges for the one-on-one races which brought the greatest prizes and prestige. In only his second match race he had to row alone when prominent professional Wallace Ross of Saint John, New Brunswick, backed out at the last moment rather than be beaten by one “just out of the amateur ranks.” O’Connor’s response was “to try {{at the top of the}} heap.” On 18 March 1888 he defeated (for a stake of $2,000) the Pacific coast champion, Henry Peterson, and then on 24 Nov. 1888 on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., he beat, for $1,000, the American champion, John <b>Teemer,</b> who had twice taken the title from Hanlan. Both races were three miles. Torontonians rewarded O’Connor with a gala reception, a $1,000 cheque, and $300 in gold. After that, he continued to win regattas with such ease that, except for one defence against fellow Canadian Jake Gaudaur Snr. in San Francisco on 2 March 1889, no one challenged him. He remained American champion until his death.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{having lost}} his American title to John <b>Teemer</b> in 1885, Hanlan {{was far from}} finished. Although he chose opponents with {{increasing}} care, he raced with success and drew large crowds to his exhibitions for another decade. In 1891 he teamed up with fellow Torontonian (and new American champion) William Joseph O’Connor* to win the American doubles championship, only to lose it the following year to Gaudaur and an American, George Hosmer. After O’Connor died in 1892, Hanlan raced with other partners but never again took a major doubles title. During his career he won more than 300 races, including exhibitions, and suffered {{fewer than a dozen}} defeats.As befits a sporting hero Hanlan was affable, handsome, hard-working, and generally honest. (After a brief scrape with the law - he escaped arrest for bootlegging outside his father’s hotel in 1876 by rowing out to a cross-lake ferry, only to return in glory following his victory in Philadelphia - he managed to avoid the scandals which plagued his rivals.) When newspapers in the United States claimed him as an American because of his successes there, he stressed his Canadian identity. His confident victories against the best rowers from the United States and Britain seemed to confirm the wisdom of the attempt to build a new northern nation, and the vitality of its rising cities and towns. The Globe called him Canada’s best immigration agent.|$|E
50|$|In February 1886 Matterson left Sydney for England, {{arriving}} {{there in}} April. On 24 May {{he was beaten}} by George Perkins over the Thames Championship Course for £400 and the Sportsman Cup, which included the English Sculling Championship. On 7 June, on the Thames, he defeated Dave Godwin for £100 a side on 16 August he beat George Perkins for £200 a side. In {{the first round of}} the Great International Sculling Sweepstakes, held on the Thames on 30 and 31 August, and 1 September 1886, he defeated Wallace Ross, of Canada, but in the second round he was beaten by John <b>Teemer</b> (America); on 10 September, on the Thames, he was beaten by G. Lee for £200 a side. Matterson returned to Sydney on 3 December of the same year. He competed in the final heat of the Lake Bathurst Handicap Outrigger Race, won by Jim Stanbury, on 14 January 1887, but was not placed. On 4 July of the same year he was beaten by Peter Kemp for £200 a side and the Tennyson Cup, over the championship course, Parramatta river. He did not again appear in a public contest until 26 September 1888, when he defeated Chris. Neilsen for £100 a side on the Parramatta river. On 29 October he was beaten by Peter Kemp on the Parramatta river, the backers of the latter laying £1000 to £300. He was third in the final of the Brisbane Aquatic Carnival, rowed on 11 December, and won by Henry Ernest Searle, with Peter Kemp second.|$|E
