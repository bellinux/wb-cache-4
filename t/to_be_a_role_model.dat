In his short spell as an international coach, he caused some controversy. His appointment was criticised by former England captain Mike Atherton, who felt that the job should not have gone to someone {{who had been on}} the rebel tour of South Africa. His attitude came under fire from former coach Keith Fletcher, who accused him of being too fond of drinking and partying, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for young international cricketers. He hit back at Fletcher, criticising his management skills. Maynard continued to coach the England side and at one point drafted in professional lyricists to help him compose an England team song.|$|E

500|$|Bart's rebellious nature, which {{frequently}} {{resulted in}} no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that [...] " [...] outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear our children will become." [...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as [...] "egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited." [...] In response to the criticism, James L.

The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. Several US public schools banned The Simpsons merchandise and T-shirts, such as one featuring Bart and the caption [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". In the season two opening episode [...] "Bart Gets an F", Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade. Several critics thought that the episode [...] "Bart Gets an F" [...] {{was a response to}} these controversies. However, Brooks denied that it was a response and added, [...] "we're mindful of it.

Most reformers agreed that decriminalizing sexual relations between adult men {{was not the same}} as advocating an acceptance of homosexual men. While the old view of “militarized” masculinity may have phased out, “family-centered” masculinity was now grounded in the traditional male, and being a proper man meant being a proper father, which was believed at the time <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>a</b> homosexual male could not fulfill.|$|R

Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had been waging a citywide campaign against graffiti that had resulted in over 300 citations during the year, was angry and criticized Bono for defacing a San Francisco landmark. She said, [...] "I am disappointed that a rock star who is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for young people chose to vandalize the work of another artist. The unfortunate incident marred an otherwise wonderful rock concert." [...] Bono was issued a citation for misdemeanor malicious mischief. [...] U2 manager Paul McGuinness said, [...] "This is clearly not an act of vandalism. This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself." [...] The numerous callers to Ronn Owens' radio talk show on KGO-AM were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not. [...] Bono soon apologized, saying [...] "I really do regret it. It was dumb." [...] The singer explained that he thought that he was honoring the artist's work and that the artist had agreed, but later Bono realized that the city owned the fountain.

500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing {{how easy it was}} for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>model</b> for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The single, [...] "Ley De Gravedad" [...] (Law of Gravity) was {{released}} {{as part of}} a public-service campaign for that matter.

However, the campaign was thought to be effective in reducing the injured, from twelve (and one death) the previous year, to three the year the campaign was run, though many members of the artistic community contributed to this effort in separate campaigns.|$|E

Nina expressed that the album's direction to a new sound reflects to her new improved self, saying [...] "I have changed a lot. From the time I came out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head.

[...] She stated that the album will be a studio album with two covers, and that its sound is going to be [...] "sexy-soul," [...] which she defined as [...] "singing from the soul but having a degree of sexiness to it."
