5|$|Some {{practitioners}} do not emphasize {{belief in}} an afterlife, instead stressing {{the importance of}} behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. It is common to find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels {{to the realm of}} the ancestors, while the other, the fetch, undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the hugr can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessrúmnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.|$|E
5|$|The team {{becomes aware}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> has the {{uncontrolled}} ability to affect electrical energy, made this way by Jacob Fischer (Max Baker). Fischer is a rogue scientist wanted by Interpol, who experimented on humans by luring his victims through bogus ads. Olivia continues to encounter John Scott, who promises {{her that he}} does love her, and will prove it. Through him, Olivia realizes that someone survived the elevator impact. Now aware of Meegar's identity, they attempt to track him. However, Meegar is captured by Fischer who wishes to perform further tests on him. Walter finds Meegar's Walkman and uses its cassette tape to find a unique electromagnetic signature, then has homing pigeons guide Olivia, Peter, and Charlie to his location. Alerted by the FBI's arrival, Fischer attempts to leave with Meegar, who escapes. After Fischer is apprehended, Meegar attempts to flee, but he's also caught. They send Meegar to a hospital to be examined.|$|E

25|$|An {{absolute}} pacifist {{is generally}} {{described by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation as one who believes that human life is so valuable, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense.

It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.|$|E

25|$|By {{riding the}} {{decelerator}} sled himself, in his 29th and last ride at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Stapp demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> can withstand at least 46.2 g (in the forward position, with adequate harnessing). This {{is the highest}} known acceleration voluntarily encountered by a human, set on December 10, 1954. Stapp reached a speed of , which broke the land speed record and made him the fastest man on earth. Stapp believed that the tolerance of humans to acceleration {{had not yet been}} reached in tests. He believed it is much greater than thought possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between human security and human rights is contested among human security advocates. Some human security advocates argue that the goal of human security should be to build upon and strengthen the existing global human rights legal framework. However, other advocates view the human rights legal framework as part of the global insecurity problem and believe <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> security approach should propel us to move above and beyond this legalistic approach to get at the underlying sources of inequality and violence which are the root causes of insecurity in today's world.|$|E
25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E

25|$|Stapp's {{research}} on the decelerator had profound implications for both civilian and military aviation. For instance, the backward-facing seat concept, which was known before, was given great impetus by the officer's crash research program. It proved beyond a doubt that this position was the safest for aircraft passengers and required little harness support. Also, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> can withstand much greater deceleration than in the forward position. As a result, many Military Air Transport Service (MATS) aircraft in USAF and carrier on-board delivery aircraft in USN were equipped or retrofitted {{with this type of}} seat. Commercial airlines were made aware of these findings, but still use forward-facing seats. The British Royal Air Force also installed it on many of their military transport aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Turing test, {{developed}} by Alan Turing in 1950, {{is a test}} of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware {{that one of the}} two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test does not check the ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely answers resemble those a human would give.|$|E
25|$|Assuming faster-than-light {{travel is}} impossible, one might {{conclude}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> can never make a round-trip farther from Earth than 20 light years if the traveler is active {{between the ages}} of 20 and 60. A traveler {{would never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems that exist within the limit of 20 light years from Earth. This, however, fails to take into account time dilation. Clocks aboard an interstellar ship would run slower than Earth clocks, so if a ship's engines were capable of continuously generating around 1g of acceleration (which is comfortable for humans), the ship could reach almost anywhere in the galaxy and return to Earth within 40 years ship-time (see diagram). Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.|$|E
