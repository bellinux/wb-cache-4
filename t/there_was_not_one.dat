5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, {{played a crucial role}} in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> picture of Æthelstan.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given {{multiple}} options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of Kanons influence, but Maeda affirmed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> person who worked on Kanon who thought that.|$|E

That's why Samuel de Champlain arranged to have young French men live with the natives, to learn their language and customs and help the French adapt to life in North America. These men, known as coureurs des bois (runners of the woods), were the first European mushers in North America, extended French influence south and west and in 1609, New France controlled all the Canadian Shield.

25|$|The {{presence}} of IGF2 RNA expression when H19 RNA was downregulated provides {{further evidence that}} IGF2 expression is tightly coupled to and dependent on the absence of H19 expression. As well, the loss of H19 in adrenal cancers may be indicative of tumor suppressor activity by H19, leading Gao et al. {{to suggest that the}} loss of H19 and subsequent gain of IGF2 may be involved in adrenal cancer induction. Although Gao et al. found that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> CpG methylation site that was more important than the others in downregulating H19 expression, they did find that the increase in CpG methylation in adrenal carcinomas followed the pattern of methylation of the normal, hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals. The mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs peaked at sites 9 and 10 in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals and the lowest mean percent methylation of H19 CpGs dipped at site 7 in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals.|$|E

Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.'

In an interview of Jun Maeda and Yūichi Suzumoto, they were both surprised to find out that the Japanese public (in March 2001) felt Air to be a soothing game, but Maeda and Suzumoto made it clear that this impression is completely at odds with their impression of the game, and they remark that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> person who worked on Air who thought that.

500|$|The rebels besieged {{and fired}} at the citadel and a wave of mass looting {{followed}} {{for the next three}} days. Virtually every Muslim, Jewish and Christian-owned shop was raided and damaged. Because the Muslim shops were the last to be plundered, their owners were able to salvage most of their valuable merchandise. A Greek monk named Spyridon who resided in the city wrote that once the homes of Egyptian officers were looted, the rebels [...] "began to loot the shops of the Jews, the Christians, the Franks, and then the Muslims. The grocers, the shoemakers and every other dealer suffered alike. Within two or three days <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> shop intact in the market". Protests by some citizens against the looting went unheeded as they were outnumbered by rebels. After the market areas were plundered, rebels began to loot the homes of Christians, which had been abandoned during the chaos, despite strict orders by rebel leaders and local sheikhs not to. [...] The latter warned that such actions would provoke the protestations of Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II, who was at war with Muhammad Ali. On 23 May, all state-owned supply warehouses and granaries were looted.|$|E

Irataba was reluctant to venture into the canyon because he feared the party would be ambushed by Paiutes aligned with Mormons. After enlisting three Hualapai guides, Irataba prepared to take his leave from the expedition and return to the Mohave community. On April 4, the Mohave received payment for their services; Möllhausen described the exchange: [...] "Lieutenant Ives informed Irataba that he had been authorized by the 'Great Grandfather in Washington' to give him two mules... for his loyalty and his trustworthiness so that he could take his possessions and those of his companions more conveniently to his home valley."

500|$|Kinesin-5, {{like all}} motor proteins, breaks down ATP into ADP and {{inorganic}} phosphate, using a water molecule, and converts the chemical energy to force and motion along microtubules. [...] Kinetic experiments reveal rates of how fast intermediate steps in catalysis occur {{and the most}} extensive set of studies on Kinesin-5 kinetics {{has been on the}} human protein. [...] X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and real-time infrared spectroscopy have been used to measure the structure of Kinesin-5 in the different catalytic intermediate states. [...] Changes in the secondary structure, or conformational switching, is required to convert and amplify biochemical changes in the catalytic active site into larger movements necessary for cellular motion. [...] For example, the first step of ATP hydrolysis, which is the attack of the terminal phosphate of ATP by a water molecule, had not been observed by x-ray crystallography in any kinesin protein, until recently in Kinesin-5. [...] This crystal structure showed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one,</b> but rather two, water molecules and they are in close association with each other. [...] A two-water catalytic model was proposed and confirmed by an alternate method to track Kinesin-5 catalysis in real-time and in a kinesin protein in a different subfamily. [...] Two-water catalytic models also are proposed in a divergent motor protein, myosin, and observed experimentally in one of its crystal structures.|$|E
