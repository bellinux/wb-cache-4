500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were wrong that day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in {{particular}} constantly attacked Ferraro's integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about [...] "the ethnic slur that I am {{somehow or other}} connected to organized crime. There's lots of innuendo but no proof. However, it is made plausible because of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> an Italian-American. This tactic comes from the poisoned well of fear and stereotype..." [...] On the , 1992, primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than a percentage point, winning 37percent of the vote to 36percent, with Sharpton and Holtzman well behind. Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Tam Dalyell, an MP {{who was at}} {{the time}} the Father of the House of Commons, {{attacked}} Mandelson by claiming he was part of a group known as Blair's 'Jewish cabal' in May 2003, leading to some outrage.

She published The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less. He did not discuss his private life, feelings, prejudices, hopes or fears, except {{with his family and}} his closest friends. He was modest and candid about himself. [...] "When I look at myself objectively," [...] he wrote in retirement, [...] "I think that what success I may have achieved through life is largely due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a good judge of men. I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution." [...] About his intellect he was equally unpretentious: [...] "Some people believe that when I am quiet that I am thinking some deep and important thoughts, when the fact is that I am thinking of nothing at all. My mind is blank." ...|$|E

On 17 January 2012, Tilda Swinton and Jamie Bell were confirmed to be in talks to join the project. Swinton first met Bong at the Cannes Film Festival, where she was of the mind {{that she did not}} want to make any other films, a decision she takes after each film: [...] "And that one (and only) condition in which I will make another film is that I will have some fun. So we started to play with the idea of what would amuse us about this." [...] Bong and Swinton experimented with voices, mannerisms and the general appearance of the character of Mason. On 18 January 2012, John Hurt was confirmed to have been cast, with Hurt stating, [...] "All the film crew refer to , with great reverence, as 'Director Bong'.
