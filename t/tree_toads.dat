5000|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is rich in}} wildlife {{with many}} endemic species of birds, and some mammals, while endemic amphibians include five species of reed frogs (Hyperolius), two species of forest treefrogs (Leptopelis), five <b>tree</b> <b>toads</b> (Nectophrynoides), four species of Microhylidae, and five Caeciliidae. Endemic reptiles include ten species of chameleons (seven Chamaeleo and three Rhampholeon), three worm snakes (Typhlops), and six Colubridae snakes. Invertebrates show very high levels of endemism too. Furthermore, study of the wildlife on these isolated hills is important for research into evolutionary pathways.|$|E
50|$|Mount Salak is {{a habitat}} {{for a variety}} of animal species, {{including}} frogs, toads, reptiles, birds, and mammals. During research, D. M.

6000|$|After Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad</b> {{had poured}} out his troubles, Peter {{went back to}} the Old Briar-patch, more puzzled than ever. If Sammy Jay was asleep in the far-away Old Pasture {{on the edge of the}} mountain, how could he be at the same time down in the Green Forest screaming? And if Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad</b> sat all night with his mouth shut tight, how could the voice of Sticky-toes be heard in an {{altogether}} different tree than the one Sticky-toes was spending the night in? Wasn't it enough to drive any one crazy? ...|$|R
50|$|The Chaco has an {{abundance}} of wildlife. Larger animals present in the region include jaguar, ocelot, puma, tapir, giant armadillo, spiny anteater, many species of foxes, numerous small wildcats, the agouti (a large rodent), the capybara (water hog), the maned wolf, the palustrian deer, the peccary and the guanaco (a camelid related to the llama).

The streams host more than 400 fish species, among which are the salmon-like dorado and the flesh-eating piranha. The region is home to many species of insects, some of which cause discomfort for travellers. Reptiles also are abundant, with numerous lizards and at least 60 known species of snakes, including many pit vipers and constrictors.

6000|$|... "No, they're not, {{but they}} are own cousins to them; they are the grandchildren of old Mr. <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad!</b> and they are called Hylas!"

6000|$|The {{darkness}} of night had closed in all around them, {{and the only}} light {{was that of the}} smoky lantern, and from the few stars that shone down through the tree tops.

60|$|Unc' Billy didn't {{waste any}} time.

Unc' Billy listened, and the longer he listened, the broader grew the smile on Unc' Billy's shrewd face.|$|R

60|$|When Unc' Billy Possum {{first heard}} {{what sounded like}} the voice of Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad,</b> he had thought, just as Peter Rabbit did, that Sticky-toes was over in an alder tree {{on the other side}} of the Laughing Brook. But when he heard a whisper right over their heads and looked up to see Sticky-toes himself, Unc' Billy almost chuckled out loud.|$|R
60|$|The {{same with}} the sun. The sun sets and has his perfect {{polarity}} in the life-circuit established between him and all living individuals. Break that circuit, and the sun breaks. Without man, beasts, butterflies, <b>trees,</b> <b>toads,</b> the sun would gutter out like a spent lamp. It is the life-emission from individuals which feeds his burning and establishes his sun-heart in its powerful equilibrium.|$|R
6000|$|The more Peter studied over it, {{the more}} puzzled he grew. The next night {{he started out}} for the Green Forest with a new plan in his head. He would hide down among the alders by the Laughing Brook. He would see for himself who was {{screaming}} with the voice of Sammy Jay and talking with the voice of Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad.</b> He just had to know! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I appoint you {{caretaker}} of my trees,' said Old Mother Nature, {{and from}} that day on little Mr. Frog lived in the trees, as did his children and his children's children, even as Sticky-toes does to-day. And though he was really a Frog, he was called the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad,</b> and the Toads have always been proud to have him so called. And {{this is the end of}} the story," [...] concluded Old Mr. Toad.|$|R
60|$|Then Peter told Unc' Billy {{all about}} Sammy Jay's {{troubles}} and {{all about the}} troubles of Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad.</b> It was the first Unc' Billy Possum had heard about it, for Unc' Billy had been away from the Green Forest and the Green Meadows for a visit and had just returned. He listened to all that Peter Rabbit had to say, and a funny, pleased sort of look came into his eyes.|$|R

6000|$|Jerry Muskrat {{looked as}} if he couldn't believe his own ears. Just then the voice of Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad</b> began to Croak [...] "It's going to rain! It's going to rain! It's going to rain!" [...] The voice seemed to come out of that very same hemlock-tree. Everybody noticed it {{and looked up at the}} tree, and while they were all trying to see Sticky-toes, {{something}} dropped plop right into their midst. It was Sticky-toes himself, and he had dropped from another tree altogether.|$|R
60|$|So Peter hunted and hunted {{all through}} the Green Forest for Sammy Jay, and asked {{everybody}} he met if they had seen Sammy. But no one had, though every one took pains to tell Peter that they had heard Sammy in the night. At last Peter found Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad.</b> He was muttering and grumbling to himself, and he didn't see Peter. Peter stopped to listen, which was, of course, a very wrong thing to do, and what he heard gave Peter an idea.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a dreadful}} {{time on the}} Green Meadows and in the Green Forest. Oh, dear, dear, dear! It really was dreadful! First Sammy Jay {{had been accused of}} {{screaming}} in the night and keeping honest little meadow and forest people awake when they wanted to sleep. And all the time Sammy Jay hadn't made a sound. Then Sticky-toes the <b>Tree</b> <b>Toad</b> had been accused of being noisy, when all the time he was sitting with his mouth closed as tight as tight could be.|$|R
