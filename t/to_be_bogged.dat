25|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the Union in late 1862 and early 1863. Although the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia had been repulsed at Antietam, it had escaped intact and had inflicted a major defeat on the Federal Army of the Potomac at Fredericksburg, Virginia, {{following}} which the Army of the Potomac was in disarray. In the West, the campaign {{for control of the}} Mississippi River seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bogged</b> down before Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederates had actually managed to retake Galveston, Texas. A mood of war-weariness was evident throughout the North, and the fall elections, regarded as a referendum on the war, had shown a swing away from the Republican party. The Lincoln Administration therefore began to apply great pressure on its field commanders to achieve some success that would lift the national spirit. It was in this atmosphere that the Navy Department began to urge an attack on Charleston.|$|E

25|$|The rear {{battalion}} was the 4th Sikh Infantry, {{which reached}} Candeapar {{in the early}} hours of 19 December, and not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bogged</b> down by the absence of the Borim bridge (already blown up), went across the Zuari river in their military tankers and then waded across a small creek, in chest high water, to reach a small dock known as Embarcadouro de Tembim in Raia, presently under survey No.44/5 of Raia Village, from where there exists a connecting road to Margão (Old Portuguese Planta 4489 & 4493). At Tembim the 4th Sikh Infantry rear battalion, took some rest in a cattle shed on the small dock, and sprawled on the ground and in the balcony of a house adjacent to the dock, drank some water, retrieved their tankers and then proceeded to Margão—the administrative centre of Southern Goa—by 12:00. From here, the column advanced towards the harbour of Mormugão. En route to this target, the column encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna, where the Indian column was joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians.|$|E

500|$|Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 30April 1954 for {{his service}} in Malaya, Scherger joined the Air Board as Air Member for Personnel in March 1955. During his term he {{commissioned}} a review into {{the effectiveness of}} the syllabus at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of missiles and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. Promoted air marshal, he became Chief of the Air Staff in March 1957, succeeding Air Marshal Sir John McCauley. Long identified as a strong contender for the RAAF's senior role, Scherger was described by Air Marshal Hardman as [...] "easily the best material on offer". He declared that as an administrator he was [...] "not going to allow myself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bogged</b> down with minor matters of detail...Broad policy comes from the top.

By 1942 a serviceable airport had been established and was named Shannon Airport. From then, passengers were moved from the flying boats in Foynes to the land planes based in Shannon Airport.

Headed by the wounded bull, whose martial ardour, like my own, was {{somewhat}} cooled, they spread out and dashed into the treacherous swamp--for such it was, though just then there was no water to be seen. For a few yards all went well with them, though they clearly found it heavy going; then suddenly the great bull sank up to his belly in the stiff peaty soil, and remained fixed. The others, mad with fear, took no heed of his struggles and trumpetings, but plunged on to meet the same fate. In five minutes the whole herd of them were hopelessly bogged, and the more they struggled to escape, the deeper they sunk. There was one exception, indeed, a cow managed to win back to firm shore, and, lifting her trunk, prepared to charge us as we came up. But at that moment she heard the scream of her calf, and rushed back to its assistance, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bogged</b> with the others.|$|E

50|$|Uranium was {{discovered}} outside {{what is now}} Litchfield's eastern boundary in August 1949, by a local prospector, Jack White.

40|$|Introduction Evaluating {{the impact}} of access <b>to</b> {{electronic}} information <b>is</b> a key challenge globally for memory institutions such as archive, libraries, and museums.

Too often evaluation of access <b>to</b> electronic resources <b>is</b> <b>bogged</b> down in the processes of managing that access.
