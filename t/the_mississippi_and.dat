The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|Cascade Locks and Canal {{were first}} {{constructed}} in 1896 around the Cascades Rapids, enabling boats to travel safely through the Columbia River Gorge. The Celilo Canal, bypassing Celilo Falls, opened to river traffic in 1915. In the mid-20thcentury, {{the construction of}} dams {{along the length of}} the river submerged the rapids beneath a series of reservoirs. An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next. A navigation channel reaching to Lewiston, Idaho, along the Columbia and Snake rivers, was completed in 1975. Among the main commodities are wheat and other grains, mainly for export. As of 2016, the Columbia ranked third, behind <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Paraná rivers, among the world's largest export corridors for grain.|$|E
5|$|Halleck {{appointed}} Pope {{to command}} the Army of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> (<b>and</b> the District of the Mississippi, Department of the Missouri) on February 23, 1862.

He then orchestrated a campaign to capture Island No. 10, a strongly fortified post garrisoned by 12,000 men and 58 guns. Pope's engineers cut a channel that allowed him to bypass the island. Assisted by the gunboats of Captain Andrew H. Foote, he landed his men on the opposite shore, which isolated the defenders. The island garrison surrendered on April 7, 1862, freeing Union navigation of the Mississippi as far south as Memphis.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps most importantly, Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. Agricultural produce could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> on to New Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul's {{history and}} growth as a landing port {{are tied to}} water. The city's {{defining}} physical characteristic, the confluence of <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.|$|E

Supporters believed the branch would economically help both Louisville and Memphis and would lessen their dependence on trade along <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Ohio Rivers. Opponents argued that the project was simply a ploy to whip up new support for the struggling railroad. Helm endorsed the Memphis branch in his annual report in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin.

Thereafter, Spain attempted to slow the migration of American settlers into the region, and to lure those already there to secede from the United States.
