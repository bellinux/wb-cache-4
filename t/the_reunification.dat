5|$|One year later, Hyun-jun {{returns to}} Korea to seek revenge. During this time, North and South Korea {{are set to}} reunify. However, the members of IRIS are intent on {{stopping}} <b>the</b> <b>reunification.</b> They attacked a local mall for hostages to blackmail {{both sides of the}} Korean government to threaten SK's president into announcing their political stand to not unite with NK. Hyun-jun became the negotiator for the president Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil) and for the hostages' release. Eventually, Sa-woo was killed. With all things hindering <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> process gone, the peace talks resumed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the US {{worked for the}} {{rearmament}} of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full membership of NATO. In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.|$|E

5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the Greeks and Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting barrier between the Latin world {{and both the}} Islamic and Orthodox religions. It was an obstacle to <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of the Christian church and created a perception of Westerners as defeated aggressors.|$|E
5|$|When Æthelwulf {{returned}} to England, Æthelbald refused to surrender the West Saxon throne, and Æthelwulf agreed {{to divide the}} kingdom, taking the east and leaving the west in Æthelbald's hands. On Æthelwulf's death in 858 he left Wessex to Æthelbald and Kent to Æthelberht, but Æthelbald's death only two years later led to <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Zoghby retired on October 24, 1988, at age 76.

The Republic of Korea awarded Rhee the Dongbaeg Medal (동백장) in 2003 for promoting taekwondo and Korean culture over the past 33 years.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{existing}} tank fleet {{did not meet}} the Spanish army's needs, Spain opened talks with Germany and Krauss-Maffei over the possibility of future collaboration in regards to Spain's future tank, and sent a military delegation to Germany in 1994. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German army after <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of Germany, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{date of the}} war's end is {{also not}} universally agreed upon. It was {{generally}} accepted {{at the time that}} the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.|$|E

Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B'Av, which marks {{the destruction of the}} Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.|$|E
5|$|The only {{contemporaneous}} {{record of}} Charles's deeds {{were made by}} a Franciscan friar who was hostile towards the monarch. Instead of emphasizing Charles's achievements in <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of the country, the friar described in detail the negative episodes of Charles's reign. In particular, the unusual cruelty that the king showed after Felician Záh's assassination attempt on the royal family contributed to the negative picture of Charles's personality. The Franciscan friar attributed Charles's defeat by Basarab of Wallachia as a punishment from God for the king's revenge.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{took office}} {{for his second}} presidential term on 1 July 1989, {{and in the course}} of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and <b>the</b> <b>Reunification</b> of Germany. Thereupon, Weizsäcker became the first all-German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945. At midnight on 3 October 1990, during the {{official}} festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark the moment of <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of Germany, President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night, immediately after the raising of the flag, and before the playing of the National Anthem. His brief remarks, however, were almost inaudible, due to the sound of the bells marking midnight, and of the fireworks that were released to celebrate the moment of reunification. In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace. He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner Philharmonie later that day.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> elections, {{on the basis}} that the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of Jerusalem in 1967, {{the city}} {{embarked}} on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were {{opened in the}} new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, drawing customers {{away from the city}} center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for <b>the</b> <b>reunification</b> of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E
