5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E

5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers were able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of}} the session.|$|E

5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion.

When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made {{that is going to be}} my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to sea on their own.|$|E

5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched {{to ensure that}} they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border.

5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E

However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol.|$|E
