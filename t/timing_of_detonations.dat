40|$|Computerized {{drilling}} and the electronic <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonations</b> are two technological breakthroughs which {{have had an}} important role in updating {{drilling and}} blasting excavation methods, although the electronic timing of detonators is still a comparatively infrequent technical solution to precision blasting problems. On the basis of an extensive collection of published cases, this paper reviews the successes achieved and the main expected advantages from the electronic ignition devices. After describing the primary characteristics of these detonators, some elements will be considered, in order to better understand their applications in different conditions, both in open pit and underground sites: extension of the time delay number, freedom in the choice of time intervals between detonations, timing accuracy, reduction of vibrations, control of back-break and fragmentation. The results are compared to those obtained by pyrotechnical timing devices, and summarized in the concluding remark...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{mechanism}} for Type Ia supernova explosions in massive white dwarfs. The proposed scenario follows from relaxing {{the assumption of}} symmetry in the model and involves a detonation created in an unconfined environment. The explosion begins with an essentially central ignition of stellar material initiating a deflagration. This deflagration results {{in the formation of}} a buoyantly-driven bubble of hot material that reaches the stellar surface at supersonic speeds. The bubble breakout forms a strong pressure wave that laterally accelerates fuel-rich outer stellar layers. This material, confined by gravity to the white dwarf, races along the stellar surface and is focused at the location opposite to the point of the bubble breakout. These streams of nuclear fuel carry enough mass and energy to trigger a detonation just above the stellar surface. The flow conditions at that moment support a detonation that will incinerate the white dwarf and result in an energetic explosion. The stellar expansion following the deflagration redistributes stellar mass in a way that ensures production of intermediate mass and iron group elements consistent with observations. The ejecta will have a strongly layered structure with a mild amount of asymmetry following from the early deflagration phase. This asymmetry, combined with the amount of stellar expansion determined by details of the evolution (principally the energetics <b>of</b> deflagration, <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>detonation,</b> and structure <b>of</b> the progenitor), can be expected to create a family of mildly diverse Type Ia supernova explosions.

500|$|Titterton {{then became}} {{involved}} with timing circuits used to track the progress of an implosion. Along with Frisch, Darol Froman, Rudolf Peierls, Philip Moon and Alvin C. Graves, he developed the [...] "pin method". Pins were placed near the implosion and connected to circuits which connected to an oscilloscope. This gave accurate <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the implosion, from which its symmetry could be evaluated. It {{turned out to be}} the most useful of several methods <b>of</b> <b>timing</b> the implosion. When the director, Robert Oppenheimer, reorganised the Los Alamos Laboratory to focus on implosion in August 1944, Titterton joined Kenneth Greisen's X-1A Section in Norris Bradbury's X-1 (Implosion) Group. The group studied the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the primacord <b>detonations</b> using X-rays. Titterton designed a circuit for measuring the spread <b>of</b> <b>detonations</b> using a variation of the pin method. He developed a device called [...] "the informer" [...] that measured the time spread among detonations (and whether all the detonators had indeed fired). In July 1945 he was a senior member <b>of</b> the <b>timing</b> group at the Trinity nuclear test that fired the first nuclear weapon at Alamogordo, New Mexico. His electronic timers tracked the progress <b>of</b> the <b>detonation.</b> In February 1946, he became the head of the P-1 (Electronics) Group. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll, and performed the countdown for both tests.|$|R
40|$|Merging carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs are a {{promising}} progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), but the underlying physics and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> are still debated. If an explosion occurs after the secondary star is fully disrupted, the exploding primary will expand into a dense CO medium that {{may still have}} a disk-like structure. This interaction will decelerate and distort the ejecta. Here we carry out multi-dimensional simulations of ``tamped" SN Ia models, using both particle and grid-based codes to study the merger and explosion dynamics, and a radiative transfer code to calculate synthetic spectra and light curves. We find that post-merger explosions exhibit an hourglass-shaped asymmetry, leading to strong variations in the light curves with viewing angle. The two most important factors affecting the outcome are the scale-height of the disk, which depends sensitively on the binary mass ratio, and the total ${}^{ 56 }$Ni yield, which is governed by the central density of the remnant core. The synthetic broadband light curves rise and decline very slowly, and the spectra generally look peculiar, with weak features from intermediate mass elements but relatively strong carbon absorption. We also consider {{the effects of the}} viscous evolution of the remnant, and show that a longer time delay between merger and explosion probably leads to larger ${}^{ 56 }$Ni yields and more symmetrical remnants. We discuss the relevance of this class of aspherical ``tamped" SN Ia for explaining the class of ``super-Chandrasekhar'' SN Ia. Comment: 13 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R

40|$|Initiation <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the {{cylindrical}} geometry {{is important}} in validating a general theory of initiation, and has particular significance to the interaction of high velocity projectiles with combustible gas. In the present study, an experimental investigation of the direct initiation <b>of</b> gaseous <b>detonations</b> by a line source of condensed explosives (detonating cord) is presented. Due to the high velocity <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> in the condensed explosive cord (6 [...] 7 km/s), the rapid chemical energy release along its length generates a quasi-cylindrical blast wave in the surrounding combustible mixture. For a sufficiently strong detonating cord, the generated blast wave is observed to decay to a stable Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conical detonation. Below a certain critical energy, the blast wave decays to low velocities without initiating detonation. In the critical regime of initiation, measurements of the combustion front velocity and direct flow visualization indicate that the blast wave decays to sub-CJ velocities before the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation.</b> The onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> is associated with discrete explosion centers. This phenomenon is similar {{to what has been}} previously observed for spherical initiation, suggesting a universal mechanism <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> initiation. The critical shock radius at which the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> occurs is correlated to the detonation cell size (lambda) of the mixture, consistently yielding a radius of 4 to 8 lambda. Using the invariance of the explosion length R 0 in the critical regime of initiation for spherical and cylindrical detonations, it is shown how the critical radii and critical energies scale between the two geometries, clarifying the correct length scales that should be used in the theory of direct initiation <b>of</b> <b>detonation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Blasting {{operations}} in built-up areas, at short distances from structures, impose new requirements on blasting techniques and properties of explosives {{in order to}} mitigate seismic effect of blasting.

40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>{{detonation}},</b> in a detonation wave there is a sound plane, named Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) plane. There are certain stationary parameters for this plane. In this work {{the possibility of the}} second CJ plane is shown. This second CJ plane is stationary as well. The physical mechanism of non-equilibrium transition providing the existence of the second CJ plane is presented. There is a non-equilibrium state, when the heat is removed from the reaction zone and the heat capacity decreases sharply. As a result of this non-equilibrium state, the sound velocity increases, and the local supersonic zone with second sonic plane (second CJ plane) appears. So the new mode <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> wave is predicted. Equations describing this mode <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> are presented.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} geometrical characteristics of the ignition chambers and flow turbulization on the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> {{and the influence of}} temperature and fuel concentration on the unburned mixture. The operation mode <b>of</b> the pulsed <b>detonation</b> wave generator is closely related to the periodical onset and degeneration <b>of</b> a <b>detonation</b> wave. The unsteady-state regimes should be self-sustained to guarantee a reliable operation of such devices. Minimizing the predetonation length and ensuring stability of the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> enables an increased effectiveness <b>of</b> pulsed <b>detonation</b> devices. The presence of one or two turbulizing chambers in the ignition section, the chambers of wider cross-section mounted in the ignition section <b>of</b> the <b>detonation</b> tube and filled with lean hydrocarbon-air mixtures, and the preheating of the mixture promotes the deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) and shortens the predetonation length. The presence of turbulizing chambers makes the DDT process less sensitive to the variation of ignition conditions. The absence of turbulizing chambers increases the predetonation length for similar initial conditions and makes the transition process very unstable with the onset <b>of</b> <b>detonation</b> having a sporadic character, the predetonation length varying stochastically, and making the DDT process very sensitive to ignition conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.
