2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} Lenihan {{claimed the}} European Central Bank forced Ireland into taking a bailout and rejected claims by a senior ECB figure {{that the bank}} warned Ireland in mid-2010 of the dangers it faced. He has also accused members of the ECB executives of briefing against Ireland and of [...] "betrayal". Lenihan criticised some of the 17 governing board members of the bank for the [...] "damaging" [...] {{manner in which they}} had briefed some media about Ireland. He said, [...] "On the betrayal issue, I did feel that some bank governors should not be speaking out of turn and that only the president should speak for the bank." [...] The position of the ECB on Ireland's seeking of assistance was {{different from that of the}} European Commission, said Mr. Lenihan. [...] "I don't think the commission were anxious to bounce member states into a programme. [...] "That was my strong impression from my discussions with Commissioner Rehn." [...] he said, adding that [...] "the ECB clearly subscribed to a different view." [...] He gave a graphic description of his feelings when the bailout talks were concluded. [...] "I've a very vivid memory of going to Brussels on the final Monday to sign the agreement and being on my own at the airport and looking at the snow gradually thawing and thinking to myself, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>terrible.</b> No Irish minister has ever had to do this before." ...|$|E

50|$|Although <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> {{news for}} the islands as a whole, as Isaac Dookhan has pointed out, this did mean {{that the value of}} land {{plummeted}} sharply, and enabled the newly free black community to purchase land where otherwise it might {{not have been able to}} do so. It also created the basis for the future peasant agricultural economy of the British Virgin Islands.|$|R

60|$|For some minutes, Granville gazed around him, half dazed, {{and in a}} {{turmoil of}} surprise, yet with a vivid passion of acute inquiry. Now he was once well awake, he must know all immediately. But how? Who to ask? <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible,</b> terrible. He had no means of {{intercommunication}} {{with the people in}} the hut. He knew none of their language, nor they of his. He was utterly alone, among unmitigated savages.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>terrible</b> to Hamel.

6000|$|... "Ah, Nell! Back at last! You've grown." [...] Then, with a {{sensation}} of every limb gone weak, {{he felt her}} arms round his neck, and herself pressed against him.

It's nothing more than after Carmen! She doesn't know what I am feeling! But he was conscious of a mad desire to clutch her to him. The touch of her had demolished all his vagueness, made things only too plain, set him on fire.|$|E

5000|$|As Wilson {{describes}} it, {{he spent}} most of 1971 and 1972 in a [...] "blur" [...] caused by alcoholism.

People ... wrote to tell me what a traitor I was and how much they hated me. Some of the letters threatened my life and thelives of my family. ... I think this is when I started serious drinking. Tim Zell of the Church of All Worlds and Green Egg wrote something like, 'Joe, how could you. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>terrible.</b> You could have gone down in history as an important founder of the pagan movement.

It was evident that the garrison was terribly weak, or they would never have abandoned the post they had so carefully fortified. Probably they had suffered dreadfully in that sortie, and Percy was sure to have been among them.|$|R

5000|$|... "Johnstonreally opened {{me up to}} a {{whole new}} world of music and a whole new {{perception}} of what an artist is. For me, he really encouraged me because if you think of someone who has been spoon-fed pop, up until 21 years old, and you hear someone like Daniel Johnston you're like 'God, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>terrible,</b> but I love it.' It sounds like a child has made it, like, the production is so all over the place. He's obviously got something very captivating here yet he doesn't fit the normal mold and people still love him. I thought 'if he can do it then I can,' that's when I started to produce things myself and play live, even though I wasn't even great on the piano. It's all about emotion and if you have heart, and people connect to that, they see right through us."

5000|$|The {{most crucial}} part of Townsend's report was that the British had {{procured}} [...] "several reams of paper made for the last emission struck by Congress."
