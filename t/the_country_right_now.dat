40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the relationship between decentralization policy in Venezuelan and the process of democratization. Critical factors here are local government development and performance. The significance of the present analysis is located in the fact that it goes deeper, it addresses the policy of decentralization by approaching local government fiscal decentralization including: main sources of municipal revenue and expenditures; it also examines the policy from the perspectives of three sets of actors: mayors, clients of municipal services, and general public opinion and understanding of the policy. These sources will allow me to develop a wider perspective in the analysis and to have a more complete idea {{about the state of the}} policy in <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> ^ One of the main conclusions of this research is to some degree decentralization policy has been useful in furthering fiscal autonomy at local level of government in Venezuela. Nevertheless, until now local government has not accomplished development due to the fact that fiscal autonomy is restricted to municipalities where economic resources are not scarce and human development is high. ^ There exist factors affecting local government generation of their own sources of revenue in Venezuela and playing a role in predicting the local government fiscal autonomy and levels of decentralization: transfers from federal government, population 2 ̆ 7 s lack of economic resources, levels of human development, and population size. Decentralization policy was supposed to get power closer to the citizens; however this evaluation did not find overwhelmingly positive results in this sense. It has not been successful in all the municipalities, in many cases because it has not been fully implemented. The policy is having positive impacts only in those sectors of the society that have learned they are entitled to participate and influence local government decisions. ^ There is not sufficient evidence in this case to support the hypothesis that the public opinion and understanding about decentralization policy contribute to satisfaction with the democratic system. <b>The</b> crisis <b>the</b> <b>country</b> is facing <b>right</b> <b>now</b> seems to not be easy to solve because the population is not satisfied with the functioning of the democratic system. Such a situation necessarily conveys political instability. ...|$|R

So we're doing a torn-from-the-headlines thing. Michael Schur,Parks and Recreation co-creator [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was written by Parks and Recreation co-creator, Michael Schur. It was his fifth writing credit for the series after, [...] "Pilot", [...] "Greg Pikitis", [...] "Christmas Scandal", and [...] "Galentine's Day". The idea of state auditors visiting Pawnee, and the subsequent government shutdown, was inspired by news reports {{at the time of}} a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession. In particular, Schur cited stories about Kansas City closing down several of their public schools, and Idaho threatening to shut down the state parks department. Similar measures were being discussed in such states as New York, New Jersey and California. This was in keeping with efforts by the Parks and Recreation writers to be more topical with second season episodes. Upon learning of the spending freeze, Ron and Leslie engage in heated arguments over the function of government, with Leslie insisting the government is meant to provide social services and Ron advocating as little government intervention as possible. Throughout most of the second season, much of the relationship between Leslie and Ron focused on the two developing a mutual respect for each other. However, with the introduction of the Ben Wyatt character and the conflict over budget problems in Pawnee, the writers included these arguments between Leslie and Ron to illustrate their conflicting political ideologies and develop tension amid the character and the city hall setting.|$|E

40|$|More than 300 million biospecimens - blood samples, saliva swabs, excised tumors - {{are housed}} in {{different}} collections all over <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Meanwhile, biometric data is constantly being compiled by sophisticated security systems, by lifestyle products, and even by ordinary ATMs. Because private companies, hospitals, for-profit testing facilities, and security companies 'own' the information they collect, it can't work for you. Billions of dollars in grants are spent each year on focused medical studies seeking information that is most likely already available, but unobtainable. The availability of biometric information to researchers able to draw real statistical conclusions from it is impeded both by a shaky notion of individuals' privacy and the proprietary funding structure by which {{much of the information}} has been gathered. The data is out there - it's not a question of wanting to share personal data or not. Measures like the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act treat a symptom of the end of privacy, but by no means secure it. The only productive embrace of this national mine of information is to make it fully transparent, to make it available to the public and researchers alike, to nationally acknowledge the end of an antiquated notion of privacy, and to stave off the flow of research dollars into patented pharmaceuticals. The Biobank for America does just that by making transparent the collection and storage of biometric information on a national scale and finally collating it into a comprehensive, searchable archive. by Sarah Hirschman.
