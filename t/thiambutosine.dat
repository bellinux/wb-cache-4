40|$|The latest {{developments}} and {{ideas in the}} therapy of leprosy are discussed, the need for long-term studies being stressed. The therapeutic efficacy and effective dosages of some sulfones (especially diaphenylsulfone), <b>thiambutosine</b> and long-acting sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxine and sulfalene, are considered. The possibilities for two newer drugs, 4, 4 â€²-diacetyldiaminodiphenylsulfone and clofazimine (B- 663), both still {{in the early stages}} of evaluation, are also described and the potential value of thalidomide in treatment of the lepra reaction is discussed. The authors make a number of recommendations for controlled trials and lines of investigation and, in particular, favour a biochemical approach to the correction of defective host defences. Diaphenylsulfone is still considered the drug of choice for use in the therapy of leprosy...|$|E
40|$|Over 100 {{patients}} with lepromatous leprosy {{were treated with}} rifampicin {{in a series of}} pilot, uncontrolled, and controlled trials in 1968 - 77. The rapid bactericidal effect of rifampicin on Mycobacterium leprae was confirmed. Clinical improvement became apparent sometimes as early as 14 days after the start of treatment. Nevertheless, a few persisting viable M leprae were detected as long as five years after the start of treatment with rifampicin either by itself or in combination with the bacteriostatic drug <b>thiambutosine.</b> Treatment with rifampicin and dapsone for six months reduced the number of persisting leprosy bacteria more than treatment with dapsone alone. Although rifampicin proved more effective than dapsone, it is unlikely that used by itself if can significantly shorten the length of treatment in lepromatous leprosy. Therefore initial intensive combined treatment with two or more bactericidal drugs (including rifampicin) warrants further investigation in both untreated leprosy and lepromatous leprosy resistant to dapsone...|$|E
