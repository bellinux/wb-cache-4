25|$|The Xia Dynasty held {{suzerainty}} over {{a number}} of kingdoms, one of which was the Kingdom of Shang. During Jie's reign, Shang grew in power, initially at the expense of Xia's other vassals. A person by the name of <b>Tang</b> <b>of</b> Shang was able to win many supporters from as many as 40 smaller kingdoms. <b>Tang</b> <b>of</b> Shang recognized that Jie mistreated the people and used this as a way to convince other supporters. In one speech <b>Tang</b> <b>of</b> Shang said that creating chaos is not something he wanted, but given the terror of Jie, he has to follow the mandate of heaven and use this opportunity to overthrow Xia. He also pointed out that even Jie’s own military generals would not obey his orders.|$|E

25|$|Jie himself escaped {{and fled}} to Sanzong. The Shang forces, under their general Wuzi (戊子), pursued Jie to Cheng, {{captured}} him at Jiaomen and deposed him, bringing the Xia dynasty to an end. Eventually, Jie {{was released in}} Nanchao.

25|$|In {{the lock}} back, {{as in many}} folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade {{prevents}} it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.|$|E
25|$|Linerlock {{mechanisms}} are most commonly composed of titanium alloy or steel. The linerlock's locking side liner is split {{from the top}} toward the bottom, similar to an automotive leaf spring (also called a lock bar) that butts up against the <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> the blade to prevent the blade from closing. In an interview with Blade in 1988, Walker stated, “This long leaf-spring effect cuts down on stress on the locking mechanism". As the lock on the original electrician's knife was mostly to hold a screwdriver blade open (the knife blade, itself was secured by a slip joint method), Walker's refinements prevented the knife blade from closing on the user's hand and converted it into a true lock.|$|E

25|$|The bolt in {{the bolt}} lock is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> the blade preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through {{the handle of}} the knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|E
500|$|The pommel and the crossguard {{are made}} of silver. The core of the grip is a brass chest {{encasing}} the <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> the blade.

500|$|Tong's {{character}} Chao {{has drawn}} mixed reception, often being mistaken {{as a real}} person. As a result for posting racist content, the account had been previously suspended {{for a period of}} fourteen days after showing a video deemed to mock African-Americans. Gabriella Nomura of The Vancouver Sun has branded Chao as [...] "a breath of politically incorrect fresh air", while Kevin <b>Tang</b> <b>of</b> Amped Asia has called him [...] "racist, sexist, vulgar, and self-deprecating" [...] but also [...] "one of the most funny Youtube celebrities". a-Tunes.net said that Chao's blackface performance, a mockery of African American people, had [...] "crossed the line". However, viewership has been positive. The [...] "Canton Style" [...] music video– a parody of Korean singer-rapper Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style"– amassed 1.1 million views within three days of its uploading. Another of Tong's uploads, [...] "Chinese Guy Eats Sooo Loud!" [...] has close to 2 million hits. His videos are, as of 2011, the number one and two most watched in Canada. Tong has said, in response to audience comments that his performances are [...] "racist", that everything is [...] "done for comedy. I'm not really racist against anybody. I take stereotypes and I make them outlandish so everybody can laugh." ...|$|E

500|$|Tang was {{the subject}} of one episode of artist Ho Tzu Nyen's {{documentary}} television series 4x4 Episodes of Singapore Art, which was broadcast on Arts Central in October 2005. He {{was also one of the}} four artists representing Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale. He presented an installation, Untitled, consisting of two beds positioned upright, the trunks of plantain trees, a portable ancestral altar, a handmade album of drawings and photographs, and other found objects. Drawings of people and faces were strapped to the beds and wrapped around the tree trunks. The installation was accompanied by a recording by Tang's son, Zai <b>Tang,</b> <b>of</b> sounds captured in Venice during a single day. The work was described by the National Arts Council as suggestive of [...] "the restlessness, rootlessness, spiritual wandering and emotional estrangement that mark the travelling life". In 2007, a work by Tang consisting of ink paintings around a well, and representing the erosion of village communities by urban development, was acquired by the Queensland Art Gallery for its Gallery of Modern Art. From January to June 2016, Tang presented Earth Work 1979 at the National Gallery Singapore, a re-staging of his 1979 exhibition, the first recorded instance of Singapore land art. The exhibition includes [...] "Gully Curtains", where Tang placed large pieces of fabric between gullies and let the rain and sun mark the fabric. His work Tiger's Whip (1991) is also displayed at the National Gallery's DBS Singapore Gallery.|$|E
500|$|Fever is {{considered}} to be a prominent example of Minogue's constant [...] "reinventions". The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as [...] "slick, minimalist and postmodern", and it was seen as a step forward from the [...] "camp-infused" [...] tone of Light Years. Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term [...] "nu-disco diva" [...] to describe Minogue during this period. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue's public image and her persona in her music videos [...] "presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal". He further remarked that the singer's [...] "hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, tonguing the sweet-and-sour <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> a techno kiss". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a [...] "classy piece of work" [...] and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in [...] "the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [...] and Christina [...] ". Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear's recording of her 2004 hit [...] "Toxic", Madonna's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Paris Hilton's musical debut Paris (2006), and radio stations' shift towards playing [...] "more groove-oriented sounds" [...] all followed the release of Fever, although he admitted that [...] "we have no way of knowing whether Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings". Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] cemented her position as an international music icon, saying [...] "Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well".|$|E
2500|$|Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{stated that}} [...] "the savoury, serio-comic <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> the Coens' film-making style is recognisably present, as is their predilection for the weirdness of hotels and motels". But {{he added that}} they [...] "have found {{something}} that has heightened and deepened their identity as film-makers: {{a real sense of}} seriousness, a sense that their offbeat Americana and gruesome and surreal comic contortions can really be {{more than the sum of}} their parts".|$|E

The capital Sabi fell almost immediately thereafter, resulting in the annexation of Baekje by Silla. King Uija and his son Buyeo Yung were sent into exile in China while {{at least some of}} the ruling class fled to Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The end of {{the handle}} was {{finished}} with a pommel for balance, to prevent the handle from sliding through the hand if the hand's grip should be loosened, and for striking or trapping the opponent as opportunity required [...] such as in [...] "withdrawing" [...] techniques. The pommel was historically peened onto the <b>tang</b> <b>of</b> the blade; thereby holding together as one solid unit the blade, guard, handle, and pommel. Most jian {{of the last century}} or so are assembled with a threaded tang onto which the pommel or pommel-nut is screwed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general view}} is that the {{practice}} is likely to have originated from the time of Emperor Li Yu (Southern <b>Tang</b> <b>of</b> the Ten Kingdoms, just before the Song dynasty). Emperor Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine [...] to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and performed a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus. Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her. The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.|$|E
