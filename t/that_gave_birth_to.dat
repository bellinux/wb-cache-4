5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism {{and the rise of}} constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E

40|$|The {{link between}} obstetric demand (natural {{selection}} for birth) and pelvic morphology in anthropoids has remained ambiguous {{for the past}} century. Though {{it is assumed that}} the dramatic sexual dimorphism seen in modern human pelves is due to obstetric demand, this does not explain why other primates <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> relatively small neonates also exhibit pelvic dimorphism. This thesis explores the correlation between obstetric demand and dimorphism and morphological integration in anthropoid pelves. Dimorphism in birth canal and non-obstetric pelvic morphology is present across most primates regardless of obstetric demand, but those primates <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> relatively large babies have the most pelvic sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism in sacral breadth is likewise most apparent in species <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> large neonates relative <b>to</b> the maternal <b>birth</b> canal. In species <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> large neonates, females also have higher magnitudes of integration in birth canal morphology compared to males, but this is not true in species <b>that</b> <b>give</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> small neonates. This study demonstrates a clear link between obstetric demand, pelvic dimorphism, and the magnitudes of pelvic integration in anthropoid primates...|$|R

London also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the Great Stink on the Thames of 1858, which led to construction of the London sewerage system soon afterward. Pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded view ability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. Reformers began to demand sewer systems, and clean water.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} of the Civil War, Wisconsin was a Republican state; in fact it is the state <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> the Republican Party, {{although}} ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the Republican coalition. Through {{the first half of the}} 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by Robert La Follette and his sons, originally of the Republican Party, but later of the revived Progressive Party. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and Democrats. Republican Senator Joe McCarthy was a controversial national figure in the early 1950s. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor Tommy Thompson and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner; prominent Democrats include Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, and Congressman David Obey.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, the Kaiser Company {{began work}} on several huge {{shipbuilding}} contracts in Oakland, {{and by the end}} of 1941 would control four major shipyards on the West Coast. During 1940, the expansion of the American defense-industrial complex in preparation for entrance into World War II resulted in a massive increase in the number of employees at the Richmond shipyard. In January 1941, Henry Kaiser asked Garfield to set up an insurance plan for the Richmond workers (this was merely contract negotiation with insurance companies), and a year later Kaiser asked Garfield to duplicate at Richmond what he had done at Desert Center and Mason City. Unlike the two other projects, the resulting entity lived on after the construction project <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> it, and it is the direct ancestor of today's Kaiser Permanente.|$|E
25|$|It {{was both}} {{necessity}} {{and the prospect}} of {{making a lot of money}} <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> the steam-powered grain elevator in Buffalo, New York, in 1843. Due to the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, Buffalo enjoyed a unique position in American geography. It stood at the intersection of two great all-water routes: one extending from New York Harbor, up the Hudson River, to Albany and, beyond it, the Port of Buffalo; the other constituted by the Great Lakes, which could theoretically take boaters in any direction they wished to go (north to Canada, west to Michigan or Wisconsin, south to Toledo and Cleveland, or east to the Atlantic Ocean). All through the 1830s, Buffalo benefited tremendously from its position. In particular, it was the recipient of most of the increasing quantities of grain (mostly wheat) that was being grown on farms in Ohio and Indiana, and shipped on Lake Erie for transshipment to the Erie Canal. If Buffalo hadn't been there, or when things got backed up there, that grain would have been loaded onto boats at Cincinnati and shipped down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.|$|E

500|$|Defining {{music as}} {{alternative}} {{is often difficult}} because of two conflicting applications of the word. Alternative can describe music that challenges {{the status quo and}} that is [...] "fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream", but the term is also used in the music industry to denote [...] "the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet." [...] However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term [...] "alternative" [...] to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach. Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book Alternative Rock cites the formation of the Sex Pistols as well as the release of the albums Horses by Patti Smith and Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed as three key events <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> alternative rock. Until recent years (early 2000s) when indie rock became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms [...] "indie rock" [...] and [...] "alternative rock" [...] were often used interchangeably; whilst there are aspects which both genres have in common, indie rock was regarded as a British-based term, unlike the more American alternative rock.|$|E
500|$|What Aflaq saw in Islam was {{a revolutionary}} movement. In {{contrast}} to other nationalities, the Arab awakening and expansion {{was attributed to}} a religious message. Because of this, Aflaq believed that the Arab's spirituality was directly linked to Islam, therefore, one could never take Islam {{out of the equation}} of what is essentially, and essentially is not, Arab. Arab nationalism, just as Islam had been during the lifetime of Muhammad, was a spiritual revolutionary movement, [...] leading the Arabs towards a new renaissance: Arab nationalism was the second revolution to appear in the Arab world. All Arab religious communities should, according to Aflaq, respect and worship the spirituality of Islam, even if they did not worship Islam in a religious sense – Aflaq was a Christian who worshipped Islam. Aflaq did not believe it was necessary to worship Muhammad, but believed that all Arabs should strive to emulate Muhammad. In the words of Aflaq himself, Arabs [...] "belong to the nation <b>that</b> <b>gave</b> <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> a Muhammad; or rather, because this Arab individual {{is a member of the}} community which Muhammad put all his efforts into creating [...] Muhammad was all the Arabs; let us today make all the Arabs Muhammad." [...] The Muslim of Muhammad's days were, according to Aflaq, synonymous with Arabs – the Arabs were the only ones to preach the message of Islam during Muhammad's lifetime. In contrast to Jesus, who was a religious leader, but not a political leader, Muhammad was both – the first leader of Islam and of the Arab world. Therefore, secularisation could not take the same shape in the Arab world as it did in the West.|$|E
