25|$|The strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of both {{cutaneous}} {{and motor}} afferents decreases with age, and this corresponds {{to an increase}} in rheobase. Two possible reasons for this age-related decrease in the strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> have been proposed. First, nerve geometry might change with age because of axonal loss and neural fibrosis. Secondly, the persistent Na+ conductance might decrease maturation. Significant decreases in threshold for sensory and motor fibers have been observed during ischemia. These decreases in threshold were furthermore associated with significant increases in the strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant,</b> appreciably indicating a significant decrease in rheobase current. These changes are thought {{to be the result of}} non-inactivating, voltage-dependent Na+ channels, which are active at resting potential.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} 20 mutations in CACNA1H associated with CAE. These mutations are likely not wholly causative and should instead {{be thought of}} as giving susceptibility.

Many of the CACNA1H mutations have a measurable effect on channel kinetics, including activation <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> and voltage dependence, deactivation <b>time</b> <b>constant,</b> and inactivation <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> and voltage dependence (summarized in Table 1). Many of these mutations should lead to neuronal excitability, though others may lead to hypoexcitability. These predictions are due to mathematical modeling and may differ from what will occur in real neurons where other proteins, some of which may interact with CACNA1H, are present.|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of the nodal membrane largely determine the axon's strength-duration properties, and these will change with changes in membrane potential, with temperature, and with demyelination as the exposed membrane is effectively enlarged by the inclusion of paranodal and intermodal membrane. Thus, the strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> {{is a reflection of}} persistent Na+ channel function, and is furthermore influenced by membrane potential and passive membrane properties. As such, many aspects of nerve excitability testing depend on sodium channel functions: namely, the strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant,</b> the recovery cycle, the stimulus-response curve, and the current-threshold relationship. Measuring responses in nerve that are related to nodal function (including strength-duration <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> and rheobase) and internodal function has allowed insight into normal axon physiology as well as normal fluctuations of electrolyte concentrations.|$|E

25|$|To {{minimize}} loading, attenuator probes (e.g.,10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9megohm {{series resistor}} shunted by a low-value capacitor {{to make an}} RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2pF capacitor for a <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of 110microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90pF in parallel with the scope input of 20pF and 1megohm (total capacitance 110pF) also gives a <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> of 110 microseconds. In practice, {{there will be an}} adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency <b>time</b> <b>constant</b> (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of R is much less than the reactance of C), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than reactance), the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.|$|E

However, through a consideration of the properties of trains of action potentials treated as traveling waves, space and <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> for the total membrane current during a propagated action potential can be derived and estimated. We show that the formal definitions of the space and <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> for the membranes with constant conductance can be extended to membranes with voltage-dependent conductance in which the behavior of each type of membrane is distinguished through the choice of the representation of the membrane conductance used in these definitions.

Additionally, sensory axons accommodate more to long-lasting hyperpolarizing currents than do motor axons, suggesting a greater expression of the hyperpolarization-activated inward rectifier channels.

40|$|Abstract Background Expiratory <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> {{are used}} to {{quantify}} emptying of the lung as a whole, and emptying of individual lung compartments. Breathing low-density helium/oxygen mixtures may modify regional <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> so as to redistribute ventilation, potentially reducing gas trapping and hyperinflation for patients with obstructive lung disease. In the present work, bench and mathematical models of the lung were used to study the influence of heterogeneous patterns of obstruction on compartmental and whole-lung <b>time</b> <b>constants.</b> Methods A two-compartment mechanical test lung was used with the resistance in one compartment held constant, {{and a series of}} increasing resistances placed in the opposite compartment. Measurements were made over a range of lung compliances during ventilation with air or with a 78 / 22 % mixture of helium/oxygen. The resistance imposed by the breathing circuit was assessed for both gases. Experimental results were compared with predictions of a mathematical model applied to the test lung and breathing circuit. In addition, compartmental and whole-lung <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> were compared with those reported by the ventilator. Results <b>Time</b> <b>constants</b> were greater for larger minute ventilation, and were reduced by substituting helium/oxygen in place of air. Notably, where <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> were long due to high lung compliance (i. e. low elasticity), helium/oxygen improved expiratory flow even for a low level of resistance representative of healthy, adult airways. In such circumstances, the resistance imposed by the external breathing circuit was significant. Mathematical predictions were in agreement with experimental results. <b>Time</b> <b>constants</b> reported by the ventilator were well-correlated with those determined for the whole-lung and for the low-resistance compartment, but poorly correlated with <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> determined for the high-resistance compartment. Conclusions It was concluded that breathing a low-density gas mixture, such as helium/oxygen, can improve expiratory flow from an obstructed lung compartment, but that such improvements will not necessarily affect <b>time</b> <b>constants</b> measured by the ventilator. Further research is required to determine if alternative measurements made at the ventilator level are predictive of regional changes in ventilation. It is anticipated that such efforts will be aided by continued development of mathematical models to include pertinent physiological and pathophysiological phenomena that are difficult to reproduce in mechanical test systems. </p...|$|R
