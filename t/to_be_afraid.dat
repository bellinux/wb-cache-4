Marge assures him he has nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of, but a green fog seeps {{in through the window}} and the Simpsons are turned inside out.

5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, late-maturing boys develop lower {{self-esteem}} and confidence and generally have lower popularity among peers, {{due to their}} less-developed physiques. Also, they experience problems with anxiety and depression {{and are more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of sex than other boys.|$|E
25|$|People {{with strong}} {{self-esteem}} {{have a positive}} self-image and enough strength so that anti-feats do not subdue their self-esteem. They have less fear of failure. These individuals appear humble, cheerful, and this shows a certain strength not to boast about feats and not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of anti-feats.|$|E
25|$|Gilgamesh and Enkidu {{journey to}} the Cedar Forest. Every few days they camp on a mountain, and perform a dream ritual. Gilgamesh has five terrifying dreams about falling mountains, thunderstorms, wild bulls, and a thunderbird that {{breathes}} fire. Despite similarities between his dream figures and earlier descriptions of Humbaba, Enkidu interprets these dreams as good omens, and denies that the frightening images represent the forest guardian. As they approach the cedar mountain, they hear Humbaba bellowing, and have to encourage each other not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hengist {{was struck}} by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the {{approach}} of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of Aurelius, for he had brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near Sheffield), intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.|$|E
25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression {{is used by}} the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates {{is that it is a}} way for males to train females <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid.</b> Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that {{it looks as if}} a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since {{returning}} from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} Friday after the siege, Uthman {{addressed}} the congregation in the mosque. After praising God and blessing and wishing peace on Muhammad, Uthman invited {{the attention of}} the people to the commandment in the Quran requiring the people to obey God, His Apostle, and those in authority among them. He observed that the Muslims had been enjoined to settle all matters by mutual consultation. He said that he had kept the doors of consultation wide open. All the allegations that had been levelled against him had been duly explained by him and shown to be false. He had expressed his readiness to solve the legitimate grievances of the people, if any. He observed that under the circumstances it was uncharitable {{on the part of some}} persons to create disturbances in Mecca. He said that he was not afraid of death, but he did not want the Muslims to be guilty of bloodshed. To him the solidarity of the Muslim community was very dear and in order to prevent dissension among the Muslims he had instructed his supporters to refrain from violence. He wanted the people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of God and not to indulge in activities subversive of Islam. He pointed out that the foreign powers smarting under their defeat inflicted by the Muslim arms had sponsored some conspiracies to subvert Islam. He warned the people not to play in the hands of the enemies of Islam. He appealed to the rebels to retire from Madina. He wanted the people of Madina to support the cause of truth and justice and withhold their support from the rebels bent on mischief.|$|E

500|$|Russell {{notes that}} monarchy arises more {{naturally}} {{than any other}} form of government, and is most cohesive. All that a monarchy requires to remain in power is, first, for the population <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of the monarch; and second, that the inner circle of supporters be inspired with both confidence and an implicit lust for power.

500|$|When Taft {{took office}} as Secretary of War in January 1904, {{he was not}} called upon to spend much time {{administering}} the army, which the president was content to do himself—Roosevelt wanted Taft as a troubleshooter in difficult situations, as a legal adviser, {{and to be able}} to give campaign speeches as he sought election in his own right. Taft strongly defended Roosevelt's record in his addresses, and wrote of the president's successful but strenuous efforts to gain election, [...] "I would not run for president if you guaranteed the office.

500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals. [...] "That gave me a lot of confidence", Pelé said, [...] "I knew then not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of whatever might come".|$|E

Guards were on duty four days a week, but no longer personally escorted volunteers. On April 23, 2013, Mora asked supporters on Facebook to petition the police for more help. [...] "Send messages to the police so they come to Moín Beach", he wrote. [...] "Tell them not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> but to come armed ... we need help and fast." [...] On April 28, Mora told La Nación that environmentalists were being threatened [...] "by a mafia that was looting the nests for eggs". According to friends, Mora received frequent death threats, including an incident just weeks before his death where he was threatened at gunpoint.|$|E
