40|$|Landfills of {{hazardous}} waste like radioactive rest products with low activity, or ashes from incinerated organic waste, need to have <b>top</b> clay <b>liners</b> for minimizing penetration and percolation of precipitated rain and meltwater. Temperature and dry weather vary interchangeably with wet periods making the clay desiccate and fissure, and subsequently wetted etc. <b>Top</b> <b>liners</b> are commonly made of smectite clay, {{which is the best}} isolating soil material, undergoing swelling and shrinkage to an extent that depends on the clay content and density. The most important question is whether such liners, in unfrozen condition and covered by erosionresisting coarse soil, maintain their coherence and tightness after centuries of hydration/dehydration cycles. The present study, made on physically confined soft Iraqi clay with about 30 % smectite indicates that initially homogeneous dense clay shrinks and desiccates and becomes fissured at 30 oC and room RH, but partly recovers by becoming water saturated by infiltrated water. A limited number of drying and wetting sequences seem to give approximately the same change, suggesting that, under common weather conditions and lack of external disturbance, such liners retain a considerable part of their initial water tightness.  Thick liners with moderately to high density and exposed to loading by overlying coarse fill are expected to serve particularly well.

5000|$|The Warren County PCB {{landfill}} {{was permitted}} as a [...] "dry-tomb" [...] toxic waste landfill by the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA approved the [...] "dry-tomb" [...] PCB landfill which failed {{from the beginning}} because it was capped with nearly a {{million gallons of water}} in it. The site never operated as a commercial facility because residents forced the Governor to include in the deed that it was a one-time only toxic waste facility. The landfill was built with plastic liners, a clay cap, and PVC pipes which allowed for methane and toxic gas to be released from the landfill. Although state officials told citizens they planned to build the landfill with a perforated pipe leachate collection system under the landfill, a system critical to a functioning [...] "dry-tomb" [...] landfill, no such leachate collection system was ever installed. The nearly 1 million gallons of water that was capped in the [...] "dry-tomb" [...] landfill could not be pumped out, and citizens later learned from state rainfall and landfill monitoring data that tens of thousands of gallons of water had been entering and exiting the landfill for years. Within a few months of burying the PCBs, EPA found significant PCB air emissions at the landfill and 1/2 mile away, but citizens did not learn about this report for another 15 years. The 60,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil were buried within about 7 feet of groundwater. Warren County's first independent scientist, Dr. Charles Mulchi, had predicted that the landfill would inevitably fail because of unsuitable soils and close proximity to groundwater. He had pointed out at a January 4, 1979, EPA public hearing that state scientists had misrepresented the depths of soil sample testing they had conducted at the site.

The selected site must be physically stable, and an elevated area with good run-off conditions of precipitated water and tight underground is preferable.

Several concepts have been proposed and two major principles are compared: 1) location above ground on a drained base with a tight <b>top</b> <b>liner</b> and a less tight bottom liner, and 2) placement below ground with clay liners surrounding the entire waste mass. In either case collection of percolated water can be arranged but maintenance over several hundred years cannot be guaranteed.

40|$|Cappings {{of waste}} piles {{conventionally}} contain a drain layer over a low-permeable clay liner composed of smectite minerals. The rate of percolation of the clay liner, {{once it has}} been largely water saturated, determines the downward migration of water into and through the underlying waste. In desert climate, cyclic variation {{in the degree of}} hydration of the clay takes place, from desiccated to largely water saturated conditions. Clays of smectite type effectively seal off the underlying waste but the content must be low for preventing contraction and expansion causing a reduced isolation potential of the liner. Penetration of the liner, implying wetting of the waste, starts when the <b>top</b> <b>liner</b> is largely water saturated but the hydration followed by dehydration is confined to take place only to a limited depth according to the assumed wetting mechanism. The rate of wetting usually follows a log time law. For an ideal composition and density of the upper clay liner there will be no percolation and wetting of the underlying waste. The paper is focused on the mechanisms involved in hydration/dehydration of top clay liner prepared by mixing clay and ballast material for providing a basis for design, construction and maintenance of well performing cappings.

40|$|Landfill {{leachate}} recirculation is {{efficient in}} reducing the leachate quantity handled by a leachate treatment plant. However, after land application of leachate, nitrification and denitrification of the ammoniacal N becomes possible and the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is produced. Lack {{of information on the}} effects of leachate recirculation on N 2 O production led to a field study being conducted in the Likang Landfill (Guangzhou, China) where leachate recirculation had been practiced for 8 yr. Monthly productions and fluxes of N 2 O from leachate and soil were studied from June to November 2000. Environmental and chemical factors regulating N 2 O production were also accessed. An impermeable <b>top</b> <b>liner</b> was not used at this site; municipal solid waste was simply covered by inert soil and compacted by bulldozers. A high N 2 O emission rate (113 mg- 2 h- 1) was detected from a leachate pond purposely formed on topsoil within the landfill boundary after leachate irrigation. A high N 2 O level (1. 09 μg L- 1) was detected in a gas sample emitted from topsoil 1 m from the leachate pond. Nitrous oxide production from denitrification in leachate-contaminated soil was at least 20 times higher than that from nitrification based on laboratory incubation studies. The N 2 O levels emitted from leachate ponds were compared with figures reported for different ecosystems and showed that {{the results of the present}} study were 68. 7 to 88. 6 times higher. Leachate recirculation can be a cost-effective operation {{in reducing the}} volume of leachate to be treated in landfill.

40|$|Wars in Iraq (1991 and 2003) {{generated}} {{various types}} of hazardous waste (HW) {{in the form of}} soil contaminated by depleted uranium (DU). Other HW emanated from destroyed army vehicles and remnants of Iraqi nuclear facilities holding various types and amounts of chemical and radioactive material. The negative impact of the various wastes on the health conditions of the population was reported from different parts of Iraq, showing an enhanced frequency of cancer and abnormally born infants. For isolating the wastes, which represent low-level and short-lived intermediate level radioactive wastes, near-surface repositories (NSR) are proposed since they represent the least expensive way of solving future problems with sufficient safety. Internationally, the timeframe of the containment of such wastes is designated to be 300 years. Site selection affects and largely controls the selection of a suitable design the aim being to minimize or eliminate migration of hazardous elements from the waste to the environment. The formulation of siting criteria is the first vital step toward the resolution of the problem. Site selection criteria are proposed taking in account three major factors: environmental, geological and socio-economic factors. Accordingly, Iraqi deserts, which make up 60 % of Iraq, represent the number one candidate for locating a safe disposal facility, primarily because of the low population, suitable topography, climatic conditions, seismic stability and availability of raw materials. Long-term performance of NSR {{is directly related to the}} function of top and bottom liner systems. They should be designed so that they are mutually compatible and combine to effectively isolate the waste. Liners are considered as the main elements of any disposal facility on the ground surface and a properly designed <b>top</b> <b>liner</b> system is of particular importance since it will minimize or eliminate water percolation into the waste body. Compacted clay liners (CCL) should preferably have with a low hydraulic conductivity, which is achievable by proper selection of raw materials, compaction density and construction methods. A further criterion is that they must not soften significantly by expansion on wetting, which puts a limit to the smectite content and density. The liners can consist of native material found near the landfill site, and be used after simple processing, primarily drying and crushing, or be mixed with fillers like silty sand. Since the hydraulic conductivity is the key property of a reliable CCL, relevant experimental determination of the hydraulic conductivity is vital. The common practice in geotechnical laboratories is to apply high hydraulic gradients for getting results quickly but this can lead to non-conservative, incorrect results. The present study involved determination of the hydraulic conductivity of a smectite-rich clay sampled at places within reasonable distance from potential NSR sites. Various hydraulic gradients were applied to samples compacted to several different densities, using two permeants and two filter types. It was concluded that the outflow filter can significantly affect the evaluated conductivity especially when applying high hydraulic gradients. This was partly explained by clogging of outflow filters of conventional fine-porous type by torn-off clay particles at such gradients. A major conclusion was that the gradient in laboratory testing should not exceed 100 m/m. In order to assess the suitability of available raw materials within the Iraqi Deserts, two smectitic soils termed as Green and Red clays were investigated for potential use in CCLs. Both clays are fairly rich in smectite, which calls for mixing them with properly graded silt/sand material from the desert for modifying the expandability. The shear strength, swelling pressure, hydraulic conductivity and creep properties were determined and used for defining criteria for selecting suitable clay-sand ratios. The results showed that 30 - 50 % Green clay mixed with sand and 40 - 60 % Red clay mixed with sand were suitable for constructing top liners with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 × 10 - 9 - 1 × 10 - 10 m/s. For bottom liners, 70 % Green clay mixed with sand and 80 % Red clay mixed with sand would be suitable; they were found to have a hydraulic conductivity of 1 × 10 - 11 m/s. The long-term performance of CCL is controlled by a number of processes like long periods of extreme dryness and short periods of very heavy rain. The percolation of water through the <b>top</b> <b>liner</b> system of a number of design alternatives were simulated using the code HELP 3. 95 D and subsequently by the FE program VADOSE/W. For the assumed NSR concept the slope stability of the <b>top</b> <b>liner</b> is essential and it was determined by using FE technique considering various slope angles. The engineering properties, primarily the hydraulic conductivity, swelling pressure and shear strength of 30 - 50 % Green clay mixed with sand were introduced in the simulations. Two initial water contents of the compacted materials were considered representing 1) optimum water content (“wet case”), and 2) air‐dry conditions (“dry case”). Application of the HELP code decided the selection of suitable CCL having a thickness of 0. 5 m and inclined by 5. 7 ᵒ. More detailed analyses with VADOSE/W showed that a mixture at the dry case would bring 0. 5 mm (0. 5 litre of leaking water per square meter) through CCL in an eight year simulation period. Long-term simulations (up to 300 years) showed that CCL would undergo continuous drying without reaching saturation even in the case of periods of very heavy rain (616 mm) for the wet and dry cases. The slope stability factor for the rather steep angle 30 ᵒ was found to be 1. 5 for the most critical case representing complete water saturation. In conclusion, the proposed materials and design features are believed to be suitable for practical application.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringTorque {{and drag}} {{calculations}} performed {{on a new}} liner drilling design indicate that a very high grade drillpipe, up to S- 135, is {{required in order to}} satisfy the requirements which both axial and torsional loading place upon the system. High torque connections for the drillpipe may also be required. The torque values found both with simulations and manual calculations, indicate that the proposed standard VAM <b>TOP</b> <b>liner</b> connections may not be strong enough to be used in this well. It is therefore recommended that VAM HTF, or similar high torque liner connections, are used in order to meet torsional loading requirements. The use of 6 5 / 8 ” drillpipe and 5 ½” drillpipe above the top of the liner is also considered. Based on the calculated recommended flow rates with regards to hole cleaning for the two systems, compared with the resulting ECD values, it is suggested that 6 5 / 8 ” drillpipe provides a better compromise between hole cleaning and ECD values. Simulations indicate that the drillpipe connections are strong enough, while manual calculations indicate that hightorque drillpipe connections should be considered. The lifting force caused by the circulation of fluid is examined, but is not found to be of significant magnitude compared to the mechanical friction. It is important to examine this force, in order {{to determine whether or not}} the system will have problems related to buckling, although it does not appear to present a problem in this case. A general approach which can be used in order to determine the fatigue loading and longevity of the liner connections is shown. However, since the actual data for the liner connections are kept confidential by the manufacturer, no specific recommendations are made. It should be noted that the conclusions of this thesis are valid for the wellpath and well conditions presented in this thesis only, and that different wellpaths and well conditions may impose other limits, either more or less stringent, on the design and use of the steerable liner drilling system...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of microelectronics, optoelectronics and data storage requires new thin solid film deposition techniques, which could fulfill {{the requirement of}} conformal coverage on complex surfaces. Supercritical Fluid Deposition (SFD) {{is a process that}} combines the advantages of gas-phase and liquid-phase deposition techniques due to the properties of supercritical fluids. Compared to the existing deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), SFD is able to deposit films at lower temperature and get conformal coverage even for high aspect ratio features. And the deposition speed of SFD is much faster than atomic layer deposition (ALD). ^ Copper is the preferred interconnect material in the microelectronics industry because of its lower resistivity and higher electron migration resistance in comparison to aluminum and its alloys. The use of copper reduces the signal transmission delay and improves reliability relative to aluminum. However copper is easily oxidized and forms the thin layer of native cuprous oxide when exposed to air. In this work, etching of cuprous oxide from Cu or SiO 2 substrates in supercritical CO 2 using β-diketone etching agents is effective and efficient. Etching with trimethyloctanedione (TMOD) at 150 °C proceeds at a rate of 15 Å/min with an activation energy of 66 kJ/mol. The formation of Cu 2 + including CuO and Cu(OH) 2 at the surface of Cu 2 O during ambient exposure appears to form a passivation layer that initially inhibits CuO etching. ^ Supercritical fluid cold wall reactors have been used for different areas of microelectronics industry. To understand the heat transfer and flow patterns inside the reactor, CFD studies have been carried out. A simple theoretical analysis indicated natural convection is very strong and turbulent within cold wall supercritical fluid deposition reactors due to the highly temperature dependent properties of SC CO 2. Two 2 D prototype simulations have been carried out to study the effects of the reactor clearance above the heater on the thermal profiles. It has been clearly demonstrated that enough clearance is critical for an even temperature distribution. It also is evident that in continuous running mode, the flow is dominated by natural convection. Two cold wall reactors with different operating modes: continuous and batch have been investigated. In three dimensions simulations, temperature variations on the heater surface have been successfully simulated. The use of the liner material to protect the reactor wall {{has been shown to be}} effective. It was also shown that the inlet flow for the continuous reactor does not impinge on the heated platen due to the strong natural convection.

A range of Mach numbers from 0. 6 to 0. 9 and incidence of the model from 0 degrees to 7 degrees with both free and fixed transition on the airfoil model, was covered. Flow visualization studies were also carried out at a few Mach numbers and incidence. Interference corrections were computed from wall pressures measured along the slat on the <b>top</b> and bottom <b>liners</b> of the modified test section and the corrected data compared with those from other tunnels. An {{analysis of the data}} on the three models of chord lengths 100 mm, 150 mm and 200 mm respectively, from the standpoint of interference due to tunnel walls, is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{marketing}} mix has attracted attention from both academics and managers and has been widely used in the marketing discipline. Despite the increasing literature being focused on services marketing in general, {{there is a lack}} of literature explaining the application of the marketing mix theory in shipping services. This paper presents the tools of the marketing mix of shipping companies active in merchant shipping. It argues that the marketing strategies are the means by which a company achieves its marketing objectives and are related to the tools of the marketing mix. An empirical research was carried out for the top 10 tanker shipping companies and for the <b>top</b> 10 <b>liner</b> operators of container ships in order to confirm that the companies understand the importance of marketing and apply improved marketing strategies. Some of the data, which were gathered in the above-mentioned research, are used in this presentation to exemplify the strategies related to the tools of the shipping marketing mix. The article concludes that the shipping company must organize its resources in such a manner as to be able to apply improved strategies of effective marketing in order to achieve a long-lasting and more effective commercial operation of its vessels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Top</b> {{and bottom}} <b>liners</b> {{are one of}} the key {{construction}} elements in every landfill. They are usually made as compacted clay liners (CCLs) composed of several layers of compacted clay with strictly defined properties or by the use of alternative materials such as: GCL – geosynthetic clay liner, BES – bentonite enhanced soils or bentonite/polymer mixtures. Following {{the state of the art}} experiences in the world, GCLs are used in Croatian landfills for several years, as well. Depending upon the location and the obeying function, GCLs have to fulfill certain conditions. A legislated compatibility criterion has to be proven by various laboratory tests. In the paper are presented the results of direct shear and chemical compatibility tests of GCLs as well as the results of permeability measurement of kaolin clay (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{hydraulic}} conductivity tests {{have been conducted}} on soil samples to develop and verify the zone of acceptance for liner placement. Compaction testing and flexible wall hydraulic conductivity tests were performed on fifteen (15) samples to determine the dry unit weight, molding water content, and laboratory permeability. Five of the fifteen samples were compacted at Standard proctor energy, five were compacted at 75 percent of Standard proctor energy, and five were compacted at 50 percent of Standard proctor energy. The results obtained from the laboratory portion of the testing program (the zone of acceptance) are presented. A ten foot-long by ten foot-foot wide by four foot tall box was created in an environmentally controlled environment (indoor lab). Six inches of sand {{were placed in the}} bottom of the box and overlain with a geotextile filter fabric. An eight-inch thick loose lift of clay was then placed, and compacted into a six-inch thick lift using two passes of a vibratory plate compactor. Five nuclear density tests were conducted on the first lift to ensure the soil was compacted within the zone of acceptance. This procedure was then continued for the remaining three lifts. A two-stage borehole (TSB) hydraulic conductivity test was conducted at the center of the test pad. The first stage (vertical) was conducted at 10 inches below the <b>top</b> of the <b>liner,</b> and the second stage (horizontal) was conducted from 10 inches to 16 inches below the <b>top</b> of the <b>liner.</b> The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB test were compared against tests conducted on landfill liner tests pads constructed at three different landfills within the state of Missouri. Two of the landfill liner tests pads were covered with tents while one was not covered. The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB did not display the same changes in hydraulic conductivity associated with diurnal cycles of direct sunlight that were observed in the landfill test pads. These diurnal cycles may result in a placement technique being rejected...|$|R
