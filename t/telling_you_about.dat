According to IGN editor Doug Perry, [...] "Crashed cars, rubbish and rubble, totally destroyed city streets, and scattered broken glass and debris, all {{are housed in}} a suburban area that truly looks devastated in the worst possible way." [...] GameSpot felt that the 3D modeling of Jill Valentine was greatly improved {{when compared to the}} [...] "blocky" [...] models in the original game. The music and sound effects received similar praise, with GamePro remarking that the game [...] "keeps the action hot by hiding what you shouldn't see, but <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it through the audio." [...] The introduction of the Nemesis creature was highly praised. Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the first encounter as shocking, while CVG said that the creature increases the tension level [...] "to an insane degree" [...] because the player never knows when he will show up.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{inspiration}} for album's single [...] "Somewhere Down the Crazy River", Lanois commented, [...] "Robbie Robertson was describing {{what it was like}} to hang out in Arkansas with Levon Helm in his old neighbourhood. He was telling me about the hot nights and fishing with dynamite, and was asking someone for directions for someplace somewhere down the crazy river. ... I had presented him with this instrument that [...] Eno introduced me to called the Suzuki Omnichord, like an electric autoharp. He found a little chord sequence with it that was sweet and wonderful. As he was developing his chord sequence I recorded him and superimposed his storytelling, which I was secretly recording, on top. That was the birth of [...] 'Somewhere Down The Crazy River.' It's kind of like a guy with a deep voice <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> steaming nights in Arkansas." [...] This song is notable as Robertson's only solo hit in the UK, reaching number 15 on the UK singles chart. His follow-up single there, [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] (also from the album), reached number 95.|$|E
