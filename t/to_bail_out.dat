40|$|We {{present a}} model that {{illustrates}} the close relationship between {{the possibility of a}} currency crisis and the amount of private-sector debt within a four-stage sequential game framework. In the first stage, the government announces its exchange rate policy, and all agents in the economy receive probabilistic information about a future shock that will occur in the last stage. This shock will affect unemployment and net returns on private sector investment. The private sector in stage 2 forms expectations about the future exchange rate and engages in risky investments. In stage 3, the government faces costs due to expectations of future devaluation and private-sector debt, anticipating the stochastic shock that will occur in stage 4 and may or may not find it optimal to pre-emptively abandon its fixed exchange rate policy. The government can commit already in stage 1 <b>to</b> <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> part of the private sector's outstanding debt if a bad shock occurs or wait until stage 4 to give an optimal bailout. A commitment <b>to</b> <b>bailing</b> <b>out</b> provides a reconciliation of the multiple equilibria that result from self-fulfilling expectations. Moreover, the government may sometimes avert currency crises by committing <b>to</b> <b>bailing</b> <b>out.</b> currency crisis; private-sector debt; sequential game analysis; financial crises...|$|R

5|$|Recent {{research}} by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the 358th Fighter Squadron of the 355th Fighter Wing. The claim is based on gun camera footage and recollections of Mayer's wingman, who was forced <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> during the action. Mayer was buried at the cemetery of Beaumont-le-Roger, France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de Lisieux.|$|E

5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} (often also {{referred}} to as the Eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis) is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other Eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).|$|E
5|$|The eurozone crisis {{resulted}} {{from a combination of}} complex factors, including the globalisation of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002–2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the financial crisis of 2007–08; international trade imbalances; real estate bubbles that have since burst; the Great Recession of 2008–2012; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by states <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socializing losses.|$|E

5|$|Ethnic tension {{continued}} to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah for the UMNO Presidency in 1987. Around this time, several deposit-taking co-operatives (DTCs), some associated with the MCA, collapsed. To save Chinese investors, the MCA asked the government <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> the DTCs, citing a previous bailout of Bumiputra financial institutions. UMNO's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai to warn that the MCA might quit the government. Later that year, the government posted several non-Chinese-educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools. Anwar Ibrahim, then Education Minister, refused to yield to protests from the MCA, and stated that the decision was final, despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities.|$|E
5|$|He {{claimed his}} {{first of two}} aerial {{victories}} in the Battle of France on 20May 1940. Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte, an element of two aircraft, with Unteroffizier (non-commissioned officer) Fritz Marcks as his wingman. The Schwarm (flight) led by Oberleutnant (Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann, Marcks and Scholz claiming one each. His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk-75 on 26May 1940. In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells tore off {{large parts of the}} aircraft's tail fin, which then collided with Osterrmann's starboard wing. The French pilot was observed <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing.|$|E

5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because {{of the dangers of}} the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> when the nose of his Mosquito was split open.

The two gradually drifted into separate lives, and after finally confronted with an affair becoming public, Kathleen sued for divorce. The precipitating event was Pilcher having been named as co-respondent in a divorce suit; it was alleged that he had committed adultery with Millicent Knight-Bruce, the wife of Major James Knight-Bruce. The case dragged on through 1910, delayed by Pilcher's inability to return from India to attend the court. Pilcher did not contest his wife's suit, and his own divorce was granted in 1911; he married Millicent, now divorced, in 1913.|$|E

5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters have the ability <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out.</b> After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v.

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|In game {{three of}} the first round series against the Ottawa Senators, Hašek removed himself in the second period and was {{replaced}} by Steve Shields. Hašek suffered a mild sprain of his right MCL, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. However, the media and some teammates speculated Hašek was using his injury <b>to</b> <b>bail</b> <b>out</b> on the team. One such individual was Buffalo News columnist Jim Kelley, who wrote a column which detailed Hašek's injury and his conflict with Nolan, and questioned the goaltender's mental toughness. When Kelley approached Hašek for an interview after a loss in game five of the best-of-seven series, Hašek attacked the journalist and received a three-game suspension and a $10,000 (US) fine {{as a result of the}} incident. With Steve Shields in goal, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Hašek did not play in the five-game loss in the following series against the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
