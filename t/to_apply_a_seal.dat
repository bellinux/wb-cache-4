In this case, foil is supplied pre-cut or in a reel. Where supplied in a reel, it is die cut and transferred onto the container neck. When the foil is in place, it is pressed down by the seal head, the induction cycle is activated and the seal is bonded to the container. This process is known as direct application or sometimes [...] "capless" [...] induction sealing.|$|R

If the oil seal ring becomes locked up against the fixed portion of the seal, high oil film crosscoupled stiffnesses can result.

50|$|Although {{the coat}} of arms is from modern times, the dragon motif of the arms was {{inspired}} by <b>a</b> medieval <b>seal</b> for the district, dating from 1344. The old municipal seal was considered unsuitable for selection as the municipal {{coat of arms}}, because to obtain a municipal coat of arms and flag, a Norwegian municipality must fulfill certain heraldic requirements that do not <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>seal.</b> For example, <b>a</b> coat of arms will generally contain only one pictorial motif, while Stjørdal's seal had three motifs and failed to meet additional requirements concerning color elements. The municipality sought assistance from the National Archives of Norway, and was referred to archivist Hallvard Trætteberg, resulting in a collaboration to develop the new coat of arms.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} which {{permits the}} evaluation of the stress-strain field in <b>an</b> elastomeric <b>seal</b> is presented. Such a procedure is based upon a mechanical modeling of the elastomer and on the employ of finite elements which can cope with high strains. Finally, the above-mentioned procedure is checked against experimental results. The problems connected with the material modeling are examined. In aprticular, the monotonicity of the constitutive relation is discussed. The difficulties encountered in the numerical simulation of the elastomeric seal are investigated. In particular, the convergence problems are discussed. The procedure is <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rectangular <b>seal</b> with rounded edges, to <b>an</b> O-ring <b>seal,</b> and to <b>a</b> U-ring <b>seal.</b> The numerical isochromatic pattern is drawn automatically and is compared to the photoelastic one.

25|$|Seals {{are used}} {{primarily}} to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There {{are two main}} ways in which <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> may be attached to a document. It may be <b>applied</b> directly <b>to</b> {{the face of the}} paper or parchment (<b>an</b> <b>applied</b> seal); or it may hang loose from it (<b>a</b> pendent <b>seal).</b> <b>A</b> pendent <b>seal</b> may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner's livery colors), or to the two ends of a strip (or tag) of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a plica) to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or tongue, but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the <b>seal's</b> reuse. If <b>a</b> forger tries <b>to</b> remove <b>an</b> <b>applied</b> <b>seal</b> from its document, it will almost certainly break. <b>A</b> pendent <b>seal</b> is easily detached by cutting the cords or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because the cords or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} program is described which developes {{an understanding of}} high-temperature solid lubrication and experimental techniques {{through the development of}} a composite lubricant coating system. The knowledge gained through this research was then <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific engineering challenge, the tribology of <b>a</b> sliding <b>seal</b> for hypersonic flight vehicles. The solid lubricant coating is a chromium carbide based composite combined with silver, which acts as a low temperature lubricant, and barium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic, which acts as a high-temperature lubricant. This composite coating provides good wear resistance and low friction for sliding contacts from room temperature to over 900 C in reducing or oxidative environments. The specific research on this coating included a composition screening using a foil gas bearing test rig and the use of thin silver films to reduce initial wear using a pin-on-disk test rig. The chemical stability of the materials used was also addressed. This research indicated that soft metallic films and materials which become soft at elevated temperatures are potentially good lubricants. The general results from the experiments with the model solid lubricant coating were then <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sliding <b>seal</b> design concept. This seal design requires that a braided ceramic fabric slide against a variety of metal counterface materials at temperatures from 25 to 850 C in an oxidative environment. A pin-on-disk tribometer was used to evaluate the tribological properties of these materials and to develop lubrication techniques. The results indicate that these seal materials must be lubricated to prevent wear and reduce friction. Thin films of silver, gold and calcium fluoride provided lubrication to the sliding materials...|$|R
40|$|Interior {{insulation}} systems {{influence the}} hygrothermal behaviour of a construction. Therefore, special attention is required towards its hygrothermal design. One approach, that is recently becoming increasingly popular, {{is based on}} the concept of capillary activity. By using vapour permeable hydrophilic insulation materials, liquid moisture occurring inside the construction can be transported back towards the interior surface to a certain extent, which helps to control the moisture level inside the construction beneath critical values. To determine a building component's hygrothermal performance prior to construction, detailed material properties have to be at hand. For various reasons, the common test methods to quantify liquid transport often do not deliver adequate results for the specific purpose. Therefore, a new laboratory test has been developed, that is carried out under conditions similar to real life. Under defined boundary conditions, a temperature below the dew point is <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> laterally <b>sealed</b> material sample, thus generating a gradient of partial pressure. The insetting vapour diffusion into the material leads to a rising moisture content and increased relative humidity at the cold side of the material. A liquid transport reverse to vapour diffusion sets in. By performing regular gravimetric as well as nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, both water gain and distribution across the sample are monitored, serving as a basis to fine?tune the liquid transport coefficients via hygrothermal computational simulation. On the basis of a fibrous insulation material, the results of the new measuring method are demonstrated and compared to the results of conventional test methods...|$|R

A calibration in absolute units, independent of previous Caltech ion chamber calibrations, was <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> Neher electrometer for use in this chamber. The new chamber was flown along with an older, argon filled, balloon type chamber in a C- 135 aircraft from 1, 000 to 40, 000 feet altitude, and other measurements of sea level cosmic ray ionization were made, resulting {{in the value of}} 2. 60 ±. 03 ion pairs/cm 3 sec atm) at sea level. The calibrations of the two instruments were found to agree within 1 percent, and the airplane data were consistent with previous balloon measurements in the upper atmosphere. Ionization due to radon gas in the atmosphere was investigated. Absolute ionization data in the lower atmosphere have been compared with results of other observers, and discrepancies have been discussed. Data from a polar orbiting ion chamber on the OGO-II, IV spacecraft have been analyzed. The problem of radioactivity produced on the spacecraft during passes through high fluxes of trapped protons has been investigated, and some corrections determined. Quiet time ionization averages over the polar regions have been plotted as function of altitude, and an analytical fit is made to the data that gives a value of 10. 4 ± 2. 3 percent for the fractional part of the ionization {{at the top of the}} atmosphere due to splash albedo particles, although this result is shown to depend on an assumed angular distribution for the albedo particles. Comparisons with other albedo measurements are made. The data are shown to be consistent with balloon and interplanetary ionization measurements. The position of the cosmic ray knee is found to exhibit an altitude dependence, a North-South effect, and a small local time variation. ...|$|R
40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contaminants outside the bearing system. These systems are often lubricated with grease; the grease {{acts as a}} lubricant for the bearing and seal and improves the sealing efficiency. In this thesis, the influence of lubricating grease on bearing seal performance is studied. Rheological properties of the grease, i. e. shear stress and normal stress difference, are evaluated and related to the lubricating and sealing performance of the sealing system. This includes the seal, grease and counterface. The grease velocity profile in the seal pocket in-between two sealing lips {{is dependent on the}} rheological properties of the grease. The velocity profile in a wide pocket is evaluated using a 1 -dimensional model based on the Herschel-Bulkley model. The velocity profile in a narrow pocket, where the influence of the side walls on the velocity profile is significant, is measured using micro particle image velocimetry. Subsequently, the radial migration of contaminants into the seal pocket is modelled and related to the sealing function of the grease. Additionally, also migration in the axial direction is found {{in the vicinity of the}} sealing contact. Experimental results show that contaminant particles in different greases consistently migrate either away from the sealing contact or towards the sealing contact, also when the pumping rate of the seal can be neglected. Lubrication of the seal lip contact is dependent on several grease properties. A lubricant film in the sealing contact may be built up as in oil lubricated seals but normal stress differences in the grease within the vicinity of the contact may result in an additional lift force. The grease, which is being sheared in the vicinity of the contact, will also contribute to the frictional torque. It is important to maintain a lubricant film in the sealing contact to minimize friction and wear. Here the replenishment of oil separated from the grease, also referred to as oil bleed, is of crucial importance. A model is presented to predict this oil bleed based on oil flow through the porous grease thickener microstructure. The model is <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> axial <b>sealing</b> contact and <b>a</b> prediction of the film thickness as a function of time is made. The work presented in the thesis gives a significant contribution to a better understanding of the influence of lubricating grease on the sealing system performance and seal lubrication conditions.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the applicability of}} metal spray coating as a waterproofing/corrosion protection method for a concrete structure used for water purification. We carried out an ozone resistance test on four metal sprays and {{evaluated the}} water permeability and bond strength of the metals with superior ozone resistance, depending on the surface treatment method. In the ozone resistance test, four metal sprays and an existing ozone-proof paint were considered. In the experiment on the water permeability and bond strength depending on the surface treatment method, the methods of no treatment, surface polishing, and two types of pore sealing agents were considered. The {{results showed that the}} sprayed titanium had the best ozone resistance. <b>Applying</b> <b>a</b> pore <b>sealing</b> agent provided the best adhesion performance, of about 3. 2 MPa. <b>Applying</b> <b>a</b> pore <b>sealing</b> agent also provided the best waterproofing performance.

Few data are available regarding the application of energy-based tissue fusion technology during anatomic lung resection. In the present study, we evaluated the use of energy-based instruments for {{the division of the}} pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. MethodsAnatomic lung resection (segmentectomy or lobectomy) was performed using energy-based coagulative fusion technology. A low-profile jaw can be used to facilitate dissection in both open and video-assisted thoracic surgery cases, <b>applying</b> <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> 6 mm wide by 22 mm in length. Two energy applications were <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the arterial and venous branches before vessel division. ResultsThe bipolar tissue fusion system was used in 211 patients between 2008 and 2010 (104 lobectomies and 107 anatomic segmentectomies). Initially, we used a device with a smaller, curved jaw (n =  12), producing a 3. 3 - to 4. 7 -cm seal. No arterial dehiscences and 2 partial venous dehiscences that were recognized and controlled intraoperatively occurred. For the remaining cases, we used a new device with a larger jaw that <b>applied</b> <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> 6 mm wide by 22 mm in length. No arterial or venous dehiscences (vessel size range, 0. 4 - 1. 2 cm) occurred. ConclusionsThe bipolar tissue fusion system provided safe and reliable control of pulmonary arterial and venous branches during anatomic lung resection. The use of energy-based tissue fusion technology represents a reasonable alternative to mechanical stapling devices during anatomic lung resection...|$|R
