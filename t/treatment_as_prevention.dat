40|$|Inorganic {{phosphate}} (Pi) plays {{a critical}} role in diverse cellular functions. Among three classes of sodium/phosphate co-transporters (NPTs), two types have been identified in mammalian lung. The potential importance of Pi as a novel signaling molecule and pulmonary expression of NPTs with poor prognosis of diverse lung diseases including cancer have prompted us to begin to define the pathways by which Pi regulates nontumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cells. Pi activates Akt phosphorylation on Thr 308 specifically, and activated signal transmits on the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. Here, we report that Pi controls cell growth by activating ERK cascades and by facilitating the translocation of Mnk 1 from cytosol into nucleus through an Akt-mediated MEK pathway. Sequentially, translocated Mnk 1 increases eIF 4 E-BP 1 phosphorylation. As a result, Pi stimulates cap-dependent protein translation. Such Akt-mediated signaling of inorganic phosphate may provide critical clues for <b>treatment</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>prevention</b> of diverse lung diseases...|$|R

Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS published an article in The Lancet promoting early and global access to HAART treatment as a strategy not just to decrease mortality and progression to AIDS, but also as a method of reducing HIV transmission. [...] HAART treatment has been found to reduce viral load to undetectable levels in the female genital tract, semen and blood. Montaner et al. suggested that this would therefore decrease transmission risk, based on studies of significant decreases in mother-to-child transmission with the use of HAART. Montaner and his colleagues presented evidence from multiple clinical trials and cohort studies showing reduction in HIV transmission among sero-discordant couples with the use of HAART, as well as regional negative correlations between increased HAART access and use and HIV transmission rates.|$|E

The main conclusion is that, unfortunately, the prescribing practices of dentists are inadequate and this is manifested by over-prescribing. Recommendations to improve antibiotic prescribing practices are presented in an attempt to curb the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and other side effects of antibiotic abuse...|$|R

5000|$|A {{separate}} {{argument for}} starting antiretroviral therapy that has gained more prominence is {{its effect on}} HIV transmission. ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions. This {{has been shown to}} lead to dramatically reduced transmission of HIV when one partner with a suppressed viral load (<50 copies/ml) has sex with a partner who is HIV negative. In clinical trial HPTN 052, 1763 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in 9 countries were planned to be followed for at least 10 years, with both groups receiving education on preventing HIV transmission and condoms, but only one group getting ART. The study was stopped early for ethical reasons {{when it became clear that}} antiviral treatment provided significant protection. Of the 28 couples where cross-infection had occurred, all but one had taken place in the control group consistent with a 96% reduction in risk of transmission while on ART. The term [...] "treatment as prevention" [...] has been used for the concept of treating patients with HIV to help prevent the spread of HIV.

5000|$|In {{the first}} 6 months after {{infection}} HIV viral loads {{tend to be}} elevated and people are more often symptomatic than in later latent phases of HIV disease. There may be special benefits to starting antiretroviral therapy early during this acute phase, including lowering the viral [...] "set-point" [...] or baseline viral load, reduce the mutation rate of the virus, and {{reduce the size of}} the viral reservoir (See section below on viral reservoirs). The SPARTAC trial compared 48 weeks of ART vs 12 weeks vs no treatment in acute HIV infection and found that 48 weeks of treatment delayed the time to decline in CD4 count below 350 cells per ml by 65 weeks and kept viral loads significantly lower even after treatment was stopped. Since viral loads are usually very high during acute infection, this period carries an estimated 26 times higher risk of transmission. By treating acutely infected patients, it is presumed that it could {{have a significant impact on}} decreasing overall HIV transmission rates since lower viral loads are associated with lower risk of transmission (See section on <b>treatment</b> <b>as</b> <b>prevention).</b> However an overall benefit has not been proven and has to be balanced with the risks of HIV treatment. Therapy during acute infection carries a grade BII recommendation from the US DHHS.|$|E
