25|$|Later in February, federal {{authorities}} announced that no new residents could {{move into the}} town and that the current population would be relocated. The decision was made with the rationale that the landslides create <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> hazard for people {{to live in the}} current location and a “New Angangueo” would be built. However, local residents were against the plan. Efforts to relocate the town were officially begun in June 2010, with a projected 600 homes in a location called Barrio Sustentable Monarca. The construction was halted by September of the same year, with only a layout traced on the site and no new homes started.|$|E
25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
25|$|England's {{response}} was reasonable, though they never looked like threatening New Zealand's massive total. Cook and Bell put on 50 runs together before Cook was bowled by Kyle Mills for 34 {{at the end}} of the eighth over, and Bell followed soon after for 25, caught by James Franklin off Bracewell. Root and Morgan both went for scores in the 20s, but the tail was found wanting as only Woakes (13) and Anderson (28) from the last six batsmen managed to reach double-figures. Trott made a valiant attempt to make up for his dropped catch off Guptill earlier in the day with an unbeaten 109 off 104 balls, but with wickets falling all around him, it was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> task for him to manage by himself. England were eventually bowled out for 273 with just under six overs left, giving New Zealand an 86-run victory and an unassailable lead in the series.|$|E

25|$|In {{the tenth}} stage, the high alps were climbed. Francis Pélissier was riding with an injured knee, but {{together}} with Lucien Buysse, {{he was planning}} to help Henri Pélissier take over the lead from their team mate Bottecchia. Although the race was neutralized on the Vars, Henri Pélissier still won the stage with a large margin to Alavoine and Bottecchia, and took over the lead. The experience of Pélissier helped him: Bottecchia was riding in <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> gear, which Pélissier saw. In order to change gears, Bottecchia would have had to dismount his bicycle, so Pélissier sped away, and Bottecchia could not follow. In the eleventh stage, the Pélissier brothers left all other cyclists behind, with only Bellenger staying within ten minutes. Alavoine had to abandon the race after an accident, which put Bottecchia in second place. At that point, all the stages left were flat stages where it is difficult to win much time, and with an almost 30 minutes lead over his team mate Bottecchia, Pélissier was assured of the victory.|$|E
25|$|The German war plan (the Schlieffen Plan) of 1905 was {{modified}} in 1908 to invade Belgium {{on the way}} to Paris but not the Netherlands. It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on. There were other factors that made it expedient for both the Allies and the Central Powers for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the Scheldt, the Rhine and the Meuse Rivers. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the Ruhr and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.|$|E
25|$|She was {{acquired}} by a film company in the early 1960s, used in {{a small number of}} films and then laid up in Southampton Water, where she was spotted in 1966 by master mariner Capt WP (Paul) Davis, a James Fisher skipper. He sold most of his collection of vintage and veteran motor cars to raise the money to buy her. With a crew of one (a retired agricultural engineer, McKenzie (Ken) Morgan), Paul sailed her around the coast to Appledore, where she was berthed on the mud in the estuary outside the port (to avoid port dues). Paul resigned his post with James Fisher and spent the next five years working on the restoration of the schooner with the help of friends, financed by the sale of more of his collection of vintage cars and on occasion by work conducting sea trials on new vessels for Appledore shipbuilders. Paul's ambition was to restore her to working condition and then to ply the Bristol channel as a merchantman again, but the job proved <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> challenge and in 1970 he sold her to the Maritime museum.|$|E

500|$|Plan 9 {{can support}} POSIX {{applications}} and can emulate the Berkeley socket interface through the ANSI/POSIX Environment (APE) that implements an interface close to ANSI C and POSIX, with some common extensions (the native Plan 9 C interfaces conform to neither standard).

500|$|In July 2011, {{a report}} by {{consultancy}} EC Harris found that Saudi Arabia is the cheapest country in the Middle East to build in, half as expensive as Bahrain, and 34% cheaper than the United Arab Emirates, where Burj Khalifa is located.

While skyscraper experts have stated that towers well over one kilometre, even two kilometres (6,562 feet) high, are technically buildable, physical sustainability and practicality issues come into play in towers of this height. From a real estate perspective, it is considered virtually impossible to create enough demand to justify such a tower, but that at some point someone with a great excess of money will likely do it anyway. As for physical restraints, Bart Leclercq, head of structures for WSP Middle East recently said, [...] "I truly believe that 1 mile—1.6 kilometres—is within range.

2500|$|The study {{utilized}} a five-step {{approach to}} obtain the best fitting bra size for an individual. The study measured 45 women using the traditional selection method that adds 4 to the band size over-the-bust method. Women tried bras on until they obtained the best fit based on professional bra fitting criteria. The researchers found that 76% of women overestimated their band and 84% underestimated their cup size. When women wear bras with <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> band, breast support is reduced. Too small a cup size may cause skin irritation. They noted that [...] "ill-fitting bras and insufficient breast support {{can lead to the}} development of musculoskeletal pain and inhibit women participating in physical activity." [...] The study recommended that women should be educated about the criteria for finding a well-fitting bra. They recommended that women measure under their bust to determine their band size rather than the traditional over the bust measurement method.|$|E

Nurse's next opportunity was with the West Indies team to England in 1963 but again he was affected by an injury that kept him lame for the greater part of the tour. He did not play a Test match but there was some qualified praise for his efforts in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "Nurse took a long time to justify the nice things claimed for him.

2500|$|The {{show has}} been {{described}} as cartoonish and likened to Tom and Jerry.

[...] After all, Tom and Jerry survived all sorts of mayhem for years with no ill-effects." [...] Television reviewer Ric Meyers joked that the A-Team used [...] "antineutron bullets—they destroy property for miles around, but never harm a human being". [...] According to certain estimates, an episode of the A-Team held up to 46 violent acts. Stephen J. Cannell, co-creator of the show responds: [...] "They were determined to make a point, and we were <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>a</b> target to resist. Cartoon violence is a scapegoat issue." [...] Originally, The A-Team's status as a hit show remained strong, but it ultimately lost out to more family-oriented shows such as The Cosby Show, Who's the Boss? and Growing Pains. [...] John J.
