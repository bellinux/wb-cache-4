5|$|Alabama {{shot down}} her first Japanese {{aircraft}} the following month, in March 1944. The ship conducted anti-aircraft defense operations during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After that, she joined other battleships that were providing gunfire {{support to the}} ground troops in the Marianas islands. She was assigned <b>to</b> <b>Task</b> Force 34 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. In early 1945, Alabama returned for repair and refit work at the Puget Sound naval yard; the work consisted primarily of improvements to her guns and radar equipment. By early May the ship returned to fleet operations. She was tasked with providing anti-aircraft support to the fast carrier groups that were launching air strikes on the Japanese main island of Kyushu. In July 1945, she shelled {{a number of areas}} in Japan, including Kamaishi on the 14th, Hitachi on the 18th, and Hamamatsu on the 29th and 30th. These turned out to be her last offensive operations of the war. Her last duty in the Far East was to assist in the landing of occupation forces in Japan, after which she departed for the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{members of}} the Qais tribo-political faction, in {{opposition}} to the Yaman faction, the Barghouti aligned themselves with Qaisi-affiliated Bedouin tribes and other prominent families, including the Khalidi clan of Jerusalem, the 'Amr, 'Azza and 'Amla clans of the Hebron area and the Samhan clan of the Bani Harith nahiya to the north. In 1855–1856 tensions between Sheikh Salih and the leading families of Nablus broke out into fierce clashes. Sheikh Salih was eventually able to compel the Ottoman authorities to take the local rulers of Nablus <b>to</b> <b>task.</b> The restive sheikhs of the Jerusalem and Hebron regions were called to Damascus to conclude a lasting peace, but all were condemned to exile in Trabzon, northern Anatolia, with the exception of Sheikh Salih who apparently impressed the governor and was allowed to return to Deir Ghassaneh. The Barghouti clan would later support the Dar Hammad tribe against the Dar Hamid, both of which were engaged in a feud in nearby Silwad. In one day of fighting, 20 men were killed, prompting Sureya Pasha, the governor of Jerusalem, to personally intervene with a detachment of Ottoman troops which forced both factions to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|In June 1870, Rose Crawshay held {{a public}} meeting at her home, {{probably}} the first in Wales to discuss women's suffrage, but she was later taken <b>to</b> <b>task</b> by the local newspaper for disturbing the peace and leading Wales' women astray. The first suffrage tour of Welsh towns was conducted the following year by Jessie Craigen, who travelled {{the south of the}} country visiting Pontypool, Pembroke Dock, Neyland, Saundersfoot and Newport. On 4 March 1872, Mrs. Crawshay held a second meeting, in Merthyr Tydfill, which resulted in a new petition being delivered, the effect of which saw the signing of petitions from Glamorgan, Monmouthshire, Denbighshire and Cardiganshire. Later that year the Bristol & West of England Society for Women's Suffrage sent two of their members, Caroline Biggs and Lilias Ashworth, on a sponsored speaking tour of south Wales which took in Pontypool, Newport, Cardiff and Haverfordwest. Despite the actions of several prominent Welsh women, such as Lady Amberley and Miss Gertrude Jenner of Wenvoe, no real suffrage movements took hold in the 1870s and the country was reliant on speaking tours from members of English societies, predominantly from Bristol, London and Manchester.|$|E

It returned to the 509th, now designated the 509th Bombardment Group, in September. On 3 September 1948, during a polar navigation training mission, it developed an engine problem after takeoff from Goose Bay Air Base, Labrador, and ran off the end of the runway when attempting to land. Heavily damaged, it never flew again, and was eventually scrapped at Goose Bay in September 1949, despite its historical significance.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{in early}} August, Duke of York was {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>Task</b> Force 37, along with four aircraft carriers and her sister-ship King George V. From 9 August, TF 37 and three American carrier task forces conducted {{a series of}} air raids on Japan, which continued until 15 August when a surrender came into effect. After the conclusion of hostilities, Duke of York, alongside her sister-ship, King George V, participated in the surrender ceremonies that took place in Tokyo Bay. The following month Duke of York sailed for Hong Kong, to join the fleet that assembled there to accept the surrender of the Japanese garrison. She was the flagship of the British Pacific Fleet when the Japanese surrendered, and remained so until June 1946, when she returned to Plymouth for an overhaul.|$|E
30|$|For the {{purposes}} of this discussion, it is essential to draw a distinction between skills and tasks. A task is a unit of work activity that produces output. A skill is a worker’s stock of capabilities for performing various tasks. Workers apply their skills <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> in exchange for wages. Canonical production functions draw an implicit equivalence between workers’ skills and their job tasks, as noted above. Here, we emphasize instead that skills are applied <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>to</b> produce output—skills do not directly produce output. This distinction is of course inconsequential if workers of a given skill always perform the same set of tasks. It is relevant, however, when the assignment of skills <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> is subject <b>to</b> change, either because shifts in market prices mandate reallocation of skills <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> or because the set of tasks demanded in the economy is altered by technological developments, trade, or offshoring. In my view, we are currently in such an era.|$|R

Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., included Wasp, the battleship , the cruiser Tuscaloosa, and eight destroyers. While en route, Wilcox was swept overboard in a heavy sea and lost. Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, who flew his flag in Wichita, took command of the task force. After arriving in Scapa Flow, Wichita and the other American ships spent several weeks training with their British counterparts. On 28 April, Wichita departed on her first major operation with the British. She {{was assigned to the}} Allied escort for the Arctic convoys QP 11 and PQ 15. The American component, organized as Task Force 99, comprised Washington, Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and four destroyers. The British assigned the carrier , the battleship , a light cruiser, and five destroyers. After successfully escorting the convoys, Wichita returned to Hvalfjörður, arriving on 6 May.|$|E

Again, the battleship provided gunfire support to the amphibious invasion along with six Allied cruisers, starting on 15 August. The bombardment lasted for two more days, after which she withdrew, first to Palermo, and then to Oran. Arkansas {{then returned to the}} United States, arriving in Boston, on 14 September, where she underwent another refit that lasted until early November. She then steamed to California, via the Panama Canal, and {{spent the rest of the}} year conducting training maneuvers. On 20 January 1945, Arkansas departed California for Pearl Harbor, and then proceeded to Ulithi, to join the fleet in preparation for the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima. There, she was assigned <b>to</b> <b>Task</b> Force 54, which included five other battleships, four cruisers, and sixteen destroyers.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{election}} as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong in 1983, {{a spate of}} reports alleging Sultan Iskandar's intention to launch a coup d'état by launching {{a state of emergency}} to overthrow the government circulated within political circles, which reached Mahathir himself.

It was hypothesised that the format in which the information is presented will determine the success of the alarm handling task, hence the proposal to match formats <b>to</b> <b>tasks.</b> The findings suggest that text-based formats are best suited <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> requiring time-based reasoning, mimic formats are best suited <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> requiring spatial location and annunciator formats are best suited <b>to</b> <b>tasks</b> requiring recognition of spatial patterns. The importance of considering both reaction time and accuracy of response in consideration of task match was also noted.

5|$|While it {{was planned}} to refuel the fleet's destroyers on 10 January, this was {{frustrated}} by bad weather. Instead, the destroyers were refueled during 11 January as the fleet proceeded south-west. Once the destroyers were refueled, the Third Fleet was reorganized for combat. Two heavy cruisers and five destroyers were transferred from Task Group 38.1 <b>to</b> <b>Task</b> Group 38.2. The later task group, {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan, was intended to launch air attacks against Cam Ranh Bay from its three large carriers and single light carrier on the morning of 12 January.

The ship was placed in Task Unit 54.2.3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March. On the afternoon of the following day, Wichita bombarded Japanese positions on the island, from 13:50 to 16:30. Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning; Wichitas gunners shot down one of the aircraft. Later that day, the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion. She continued to shell the island through 28 March. The next day, she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition. The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover underwater demolition teams as they cleared beach obstacles. Wichita continued to support the demolition teams the next day, as well as shelling targets ashore. On 31 March, Wichita bombarded the sea wall to create a breach in preparation for the landings.|$|E
5|$|As of January 1945, the Third Fleet {{was built}} around the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was the main US Navy strike force in the Pacific. Control of this force alternated at regular {{intervals}} between the Third and Fifth Fleets (commanded by Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance respectively), with its designation also changing from Task Force 38 <b>to</b> <b>Task</b> Force 58. As Task Force 38 it was commanded by Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. In January 1945 Task Force 38 was organized into three fast carrier task groups and a night carrier group. The fast carrier groups were Task Group 38.1 with four aircraft carriers, two battleships, six cruisers and 25 destroyers, Task Group 38.2 with four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 24 destroyers and Task Group 38.3 which comprised four carriers, three battleships, five cruisers and 17 destroyers. The night carrier group, Task Group 38.5, had two carriers and six destroyers, and operated with Task Group 38.2 during the day. These carrier groups embarked around 900 aircraft in total. The other major element of the fleet was a logistics element designated Task Group 30.8 which comprised a varying number of tankers and ammunition ships, several escort carriers which transported replacement aircraft for Task Force 38 {{and a large number}} of escorting destroyers. In addition, the fleet was assigned an anti-submarine hunter-killer force designated Task Group 30.7 which was equipped with an escort carrier and three destroyer escorts and typically operated in support of Task Group 30.8.|$|E
