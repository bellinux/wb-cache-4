5|$|Richard de Rulos, who was Lord of Deeping Fen {{during the}} reign of William the Conqueror erected a strong {{embankment}} to prevent flooding of the meadows adjoining the river, which then became fertile fields and a pleasure garden. During the reign of Henry III (1207–1272), complaints were made that of the two channels below Crowland, the one to Spalding was more favourable to the passage of barges, but the Abbot of Crowland had obstructed and narrowed its course by planting willow trees. In the fourteenth century, Spalding was charged with failing <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> and repair the river, causing damage to the king's liege people, but argued that because it was tidal at this point, it was an arm of the sea, and so they were not responsible.|$|E
5|$|Stricken {{from the}} naval {{register}} on 2 August 1947, the ship remained as a training vessel until August 1951, {{when she was}} sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain. After preparing from 5 to 18 September, São Paulo was given an eight-man caretaker crew and taken under tow by two tugs, Dexterous and Bustler, in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to Greenock and the breakers. When north of the Azores in early November, the two lines snapped during a strong storm. American B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and British planes were launched <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> the Atlantic for the missing ship. The ship was reported as found on the 15th, but this proved to be false. The search was ended on 10 December without finding São Paulo or her crew.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode, Aldaris, Zeratul, {{and the newly}} {{promoted}} Artanis work to evacuate the surviving Protoss from their devastated homeworld through a warp gate to a dark templar colony on Shakuras, where they meet the matriarch of the dark templar, Raszagal. Although the Zerg are able to follow the Protoss to Shakuras, Raszagal informs the survivors of a Xel'Naga temple {{on the surface of}} the planet with the power <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> the Zerg from the surface if activated. With Zeratul and Artanis reluctantly partnering with Sarah Kerrigan, who informs them of a new Overmind growing on Char, the player joins them in an operation to recover two key crystals (Khalis and Uraj) necessary to operate the temple. Upon their return, it is revealed that Aldaris has begun an uprising against the dark templar over their alliance with Kerrigan. The uprising is crushed, and Aldaris is killed by Kerrigan, who reveals that her motives are to ensure the destruction of the Zerg cerebrates on Shakuras so she can gain control of the Zerg herself before departing the planet. Despite knowing that activating the temple will accomplish Kerrigan's objectives, Zeratul and Artanis proceed with little other choice, wiping the Zerg off Shakuras' surface.|$|E
50|$|Between Glenside and Takapu Road, the six steel bridges {{built to}} cross the stream have {{abutments}} and piers built on concrete mass foundations without piles. The Tangiwai disaster in 1953 emphasised the susceptibility of these bridges <b>to</b> <b>scouring</b> during floods.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Gradients of {{physical}} disturbance {{are central to}} theories of community organization yet rarely are studies performed in which physical factors are experimentally manipulated. Pothole tidepool algal communities exhibit distinct zonation patterns {{from top to bottom}} that result from scouring by rocks and other debris in the pools. Scouring is easily manipulated by removing or adding rocks to tidepools. Thus, the gradient {{of physical}} disturbance potentially causing community patterns can be manipulated to test theories of community organization. I documented the distribution pattern of algae inhabiting pothole tidepools and measured a number of physical factors which were hypothesized to be responsible for the observed zonation patterns. Then, I experimentally evaluated the roles of physical disturbance, herbivory, and competition in these tidepool communities. I found that scouring by rocks was primarily responsible for the observed zonation patterns in pothole tidepools. However, not all pools are potholes. Evaluation of the physical properties effecting the cobble-retaining ability of tidepools enabled prediction over a broad geographic range of pools likely to have cobbles and thus show typical pothole algal zonation patterns. Coralline algae (Rhodophyta, Corallinaceae) are a dominant feature of tidepools as well as many low intertidal and subtidal habitats. I evaluated the relative resistance of coralline algae (both articulated and crustose forms) and other common tidepool algae <b>to</b> <b>scouring</b> by rocks. Coralline crusts were highly resistant <b>to</b> <b>scouring</b> while articulated coralline algae are very susceptible <b>to</b> <b>scouring.</b> Erect fleshy algal species showed intermediate resistance <b>to</b> <b>scouring.</b> This corresponds well to observed algal zonation patterns in intertidal potholes. Based on this information, I proposed that wave-induced scouring may have been the selective force for the initial incorporation of calcium carbonate into algal thalli...|$|R

25|$|With growing {{support from}} the country's inhabitants, the Kandyans {{prevented}} Portuguese supply caravans from reaching Kandy. Desperate for food, the Portuguese soon began <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> the countryside. Kandyans frequently ambushed these foraging parties and cut down the stragglers. So Pedro Lopes de Sousa decided to organize a large raiding party instead of small foraging groups, and Jayavira Bandara persuaded him to send out Luís Moro Mudali, with a force of 3000 men, to the Principality of Uva.|$|E

25|$|Threats to {{the trees}} include land-clearing, rodents and exotic grasses. The {{non-native}} grasses are more aggressive and produce more seed than the native perennials, which attracts seed-eaters like Botta's Pocket Gopher that also feed on acorns and oak seedlings. Restoration includes breaching the levees, allowing floodwaters <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> out the non-native grasses, reduce rodent populations and deposit sediment. With the buildup of sand and sediments in the flooded areas, studies have shown an increase growth of cottonwoods and willows, which in turn trap more sediments during the next flood cycles.|$|E
25|$|To {{build the}} stupa, Phagpa drafted {{artisans}} from Nepal. The iconographies and artistic {{values of the}} Tibetans had a close affinity {{with those of the}} Nepali tradition. Therefore, it was natural for Phagpa to turn to Nepal for gifted artists. He intended to recruit one hundred artists, but Jaya Bhim Dev Malla, the king of Nepal at the time, was able to hand over only eighty. With his appointment as Imperial Preceptor in 1260, it must have been his vision and ambition for the future propagation of his sect throughout the still growing Mongol empire that he tried <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> for more artists.|$|E

25|$|Hydroelectric {{projects}} can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both {{upstream and downstream}} of {{the plant}} site. Generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment. Water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>scouring</b> of river beds and loss of riverbanks.

25|$|The Romans {{were the}} first to exploit mineral {{deposits}} using advanced technology, especially the use of aqueducts to bring water from great distances to help operations at the pithead. Their technology is most visible at sites in Britain such as Dolaucothi where they exploited gold deposits with at least 5 long aqueducts tapping adjacent rivers and streams. They used the water to prospect for ore by unleashing a wave of water from a tank <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> away the soil and so reveal the bedrock with any veins exposed to sight. They used the same method (known as hushing) to remove waste rock, and then to quench hot rocks weakened by fire-setting.|$|E
25|$|In the Mongolian People's Republic, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party {{organized}} {{two national}} wolf hunting weeks, one in March {{and another in}} December. Anyone who killed a wolf and presented a pair of ears as proof was rewarded with a sheep and some felt. Each May, the government commanded the populace <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> the countryside for wolf lairs {{in an effort to}} exterminate wolf pups. When the inhabitants of a district believed it had destroyed its last wolf, the local government would proclaim a public holiday. Records show that up to 5,000 wolves were taken annually in the early 1930s. 4,000–4,500 wolves were killed annually in Mongolia in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Cleansing and polishing: Walnut shells {{are mostly}} used to clean soft metals, fiberglass, plastics, wood and stone. This {{environmentally}} friendly and recyclable soft grit abrasive {{is well suited}} for air blasting, deburring, descaling, and polishing operations because of its elasticity and resilience. Uses include cleaning automobile and jet engines, electronic circuit boards, and paint and graffiti removal. For example: In {{the early days of}} jet transportation, crushed walnut shells were used <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> the compressor airfoils clean, but when engines with air cooled vanes and blades in the turbine started being manufactured, this practice was stopped because the crushed shells tended to plug up the cooling passages to the turbine, resulting in turbine failures due to overheating.|$|E
50|$|As water {{passes over}} a {{spillway}} {{and down the}} chute, potential energy converts into increasing kinetic energy. Failure to dissipate the water's energy can lead <b>to</b> <b>scouring</b> and erosion at the dam's toe (base). This can cause spillway damage and undermine the dam's stability. To put this energy in perspective, the spillways at Tarbela Dam could, at full capacity, produce 40,000 MW; about ten times the capacity of its power plant.|$|R

25|$|The Mau {{published}} the Samoa Guardian newspaper as a mouthpiece for the movement. To demonstrate {{the extent of}} popular support for the Mau, Nelson organised a sports meeting for movement members on the King's Birthday, in parallel with the official event, and held a well-attended ball at his home on the same night. Movement members had begun to engage in acts of noncooperation: neglecting the compulsory weekly search for the rhinoceros beetle, enemy of the coconut palm, thereby threatening the lucrative copra industry. When New Zealand administrators imposed a per-capita beetle quota, many Samoan villages resisted by breeding the insects in tightly-woven baskets rather than comply with the orders <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> the forests and collect them.|$|E
25|$|Both the Bourne Eau and the Glen were {{affected}} by flooding, causing failure of the banks, which was addressed in the Black Sluice act of 1765. The history of navigation is intimately tied up {{with that of the}} Bourne Eau, since Bourne was the main centre of population above Spalding. The Bourne Eau act of 1781 appointed trustees, who were <b>to</b> <b>scour</b> and cleanse the river, and could charge tolls to fund the operation. Corn and wool passed down the river, bound for Boston, while coal and groceries were the principal cargo in the opposite direction. In 1792, Thomas Hawkes wrote about trade in timber, which was carried from Bourne to Spalding, and there was a boat which carried passengers to the market at Spalding on Tuesdays, but he comments that the service was erratic, as there was often too little or too much water for the vessels to operate. The Black Sluice Commissioners installed flood doors between the Glen and the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, to prevent high water levels in the Glen passing up the river to Bourne.|$|E

Whether the engineering problem at hand is to mitigate risk for a bridge at a fixed location, optimal placement of a new bridge <b>to</b> minimize <b>scour</b> risk within design constraints, or best placing an unavoidable encroachment when flexibility exists, understanding the sensitivity of <b>scour</b> <b>to</b> floodplain access at different locations both up and downstream of the bridge (existing or proposed) is key.|$|R

50|$|Gravity dams {{provide some}} {{advantages}} over embankment dams. The main advantage being {{that they can}} tolerate minor over topping flows as the concrete is resistant <b>to</b> <b>scouring.</b> Large overtopping flows are still a problem, as they can scour the foundations if not accounted for in the design. A disadvantage of gravity dams is that due to their large footprint, they are susceptible to uplift pressures which act as a de-stabilising force. Uplift pressures (buoyancy) can be reduced by internal and foundation drainage systems which reduces the pressures.|$|R
