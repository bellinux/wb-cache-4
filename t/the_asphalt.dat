High winds damaged the ship's mast including radar and radio communications antennas. Though the crew was prepared to abandon ship, Hazelwood rallied them and guided the ship to safety.

5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E

5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and <b>The</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Jungle (1950).|$|E

This also allowed <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> parking to be changed to concrete and for adding artificial turf to the football field, which saves on future maintenance costs. Installation of the football field's turf was completed in September 2011. In early 2012, the Board of Education approved a 1-1 initiative, providing every student with an iPad.

5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built high up the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E
5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and <b>The</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Ace in the Hole (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E
25|$|The largest use {{of asphalt}} is for making asphalt {{concrete}} for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> {{consumed in the}} United States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated {{so it can be}} mixed with the aggregates at <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> and the aggregates, but warm-mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> to modify its properties according to the application for which <b>the</b> <b>asphalt</b> is ultimately intended.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown from {{existing}} studies that foamed Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) can effectively improve <b>the</b> workability of <b>asphalt</b> mixtures at relatively low temperature.
