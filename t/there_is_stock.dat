6000|$|I go to Concord in the morning, but {{shall have}} barely {{time to see}} [...] you there, even if I {{do as much as}} that; so that I can't forbear to [...] say to you now the word I wanted as to my {{impression}} of yesterday [...] about Hawthorne and Ellery Channing. Hawthorne isn't to me a [...] prepossessing figure, nor apparently at all an enjoying person in [...] any way: he has all the while the look--or would have to the [...] unknowing--of a rogue who suddenly finds himself in a company of [...] detectives. But in spite of his rusticity I felt a sympathy for [...] him fairly amounting to anguish, and couldn't take my eyes off him [...] all dinner, nor my rapt attention: as that indecisive little Dr. [...] Hedge[9] found, I am afraid, to his cost, for I hardly heard a word [...] of what he kept on saying to me, and resented his maliciously [...] putting his artificial person between me and the profitable object [...] of study. (It isn't however that I now feel any ill-will to him--I [...] could recommend anyone but myself to go and hear him preach. The [...] thing was that Hawthorne seemed to me to possess human substance [...] and not to have dissipated it all away like that culturally [...] debauched ----, or even like good inoffensive comforting [...] Longfellow.) John Forbes and you kept up the human balance at the [...] other end of the table, but my region was a desert with H. for its [...] only oasis. It was so pathetic to see him, contented sprawling [...] Concord owl that he was and always has been, brought blindfold into [...] that brilliant daylight and expected to wink and be lively, like [...] some dapper Tommy Titmouse. I felt him bury his eyes in his plate [...] and eat with such voracity that no one should dare to speak to him. [...] My heart broke for him as his attenuated left-hand neighbour kept [...] putting forth his long antennae to stroke his face and try [...] whether his eyes were open. It was heavenly to see him persist in [...] ignoring the spectral smiles--in eating his dinner and doing [...] nothing but that, and then go home to his Concord den to fall upon [...] his knees and ask his heavenly Father why it was that an owl [...] couldn't remain an owl and not be forced into the diversions of a [...] canary. I have no doubt that all the tenderest angels saw to his [...] case that night and poured oil into his wounds more soothing than [...] gentlemen ever know. W. Ellery Channing too seemed so human and [...] good--sweet as summer and fragrant as pinewoods. He is more [...] sophisticated than Hawthorne of course, but still he was kin; and I [...] felt the world richer by two men, who had not yet lost themselves [...] in mere members of society. This is what I suspect--that we are [...] fast getting so fearful one to another, we [...] "members of society" [...] that we shall ere long begin to kill one another in self-defence [...] and give place in that way at last to a more veracious state of [...] things. The old world is breaking up on all hands: the glimpse of [...] the everlasting granite I caught in H. and W. E. shows me that [...] <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>stock</b> enough left for fifty better. Let the old impostors [...] go, bag and baggage, for a very real and substantial one is aching [...] to come in, in which the churl shall not be exalted to a place of [...] dignity, in which innocence shall never be tarnished nor trafficked [...] in, in which every man's freedom shall be respected down to its [...] feeblest filament as the radiant altar of God. To the angels, says [...] Swedenborg, death means resurrection to life; by that necessary [...] rule of inversion which keeps them separate from us and us from [...] them, and so prevents our being mutual nuisances. Let us then [...] accept political and all other distraction that chooses to come; [...] because what is disorder and wrath and contention on the surface is [...] sure to be the greatest peace at the centre, working its way thus [...] to a surface that shall never be disorderly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a possible explanation}} for stock market hysteresis following a resource discovery. The existence of a parallel stock market effect is shown, independent of the standard 'Dutch disease' effect of a resource discovery. That is, there is a long-run fall {{in the stock market}} value in response to the resource discovery. Furthermore, it is shown that a sufficiently large discovery may lead to a switch from a 'high' to a 'low' stock market value equilibrium. If the resource discovery proves subsequently to be unfounded, the economy will become stuck in the low stock market value state. In other words, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>stock</b> market hysteresis. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the stock markets 2 ̆ 7 shock due to the effect of the price of oil in the East Asia Region. Particularly, this study examines if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>stock</b> market interdependence during global oil price shocks (sudden changes) for a sample of five total oil importers (the Philippines, Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan), four net oil importers (Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and China), and one net oil exporter (Malaysia) between 1999 and 2014. From the result, an oil price change is collectively found to have a small but significant positive impact on the stock markets, in particular where a sudden decrease in oil prices tends to cause a stock market downturn and volatility. The world economy 2 ̆ 7 s spending, financial investments in oil futures and foreign investment by oil rich nations are some underlying motives for inducing this oil-stock positive relation. The same direction of time-varying conditional correlations is found across East Asian stock markets during negative oil price shocks. The integration among East Asian stock markets is inducing the oil shock contagion to be transmitted from direct oil-affected countries (South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore) to non-direct oil affected countries 2 ̆ 7 (Japan and Taiwan) stock markets. In spite of a long practiced ASEAN+ 3 macroeconomics surveillance process and Early Warning System (EWS) which can be customized for stock markets to prevent or detect the oil risk, hedging against initial oil-affected stock markets and a stronger influence by the East Asian countries in the global world of oil and capital investment are strongly suggested...|$|E
40|$|A large online {{retailer}} strategically stocks inventory for SKUs with low demand. The motivations are {{to provide a}} wide range of selections and faster customer fulfillment service. We assume the {{online retailer}} has the technological capability to manage and control the inventory globally: all warehouses act as one to serve the global demand simultaneously. The online retailer will utilize its entire inventory, regardless of location, to serve demand. We study inventory allocation and order fulfillment policies among warehouses for low-demand SKUs at an online retailer. Thus, given the global demand and an order fulfillment policy, there are tradeoffs involving inventory holding costs, transportation costs, and backordering costs in determining the optimal system inventory level and allocation of inventory to warehouses. For the case of Poisson demand and constant replenishment lead time, we develop methods to approximate the key system performance metrics like transshipment, backorders and average system inventory for one-for-one replenishment policies when warehouses hold exactly one unit of inventory. We run computational experiments to test the accuracy of the approximation. We develop extensions for cases when more than one unit of inventory is held at a warehouse. (cont.) We then use these results to develop guidelines for inventory stocking and order fulfillment policies for online retailers. We also compare warehouse allocation policies for conditions when an order arrives but the preferred warehouse does not have stock although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>stock</b> at more than one other location in the system. We develop intuition about the performance of these policies and run simulations to verify our hypotheses about these policies. by Pallav Chhaochhria. Thesis (S. M.)
