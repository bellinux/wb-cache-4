500|$|He has a {{reputation}} for being brash, even rude, when it comes to discussing gay concerns, especially gay sex. Matthías Matthíasson, Director of Samtökin '78, Iceland's gay and lesbian rights group, has commented: [...] "He says <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never say. But he is an exquisite addition to the gay voice in Iceland." [...] As a gay activist, Paul Oscar helped to organize a Gay Pride Festival in Reykjavík in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The team's uniform did {{not change}} {{significantly}} after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase [...] "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept {{as a way to}} expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying [...] "When I found out I had cancer, there were two <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!" ...|$|E

500|$|Most of Hutcherson's {{childhood}} {{was spent on}} film sets {{rather than in a}} classroom. He attended New Haven Elementary School in Union until he began his career at the age of nine, after which he began homeschooling, with his mother as his teacher. He later returned to Kentucky to attend Ryle High School for one semester. Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon. He later said of his schooling experiences, [...] "I know it's something kids have to deal with every single day but getting {{up at the same time}} every day and having to listen to teachers talk about <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn so much more easily on my own, I hated it." ...|$|E
500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act. Next a jazz version of [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was performed with her two female back-up dancers. Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed an old man in his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing about all the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have had, but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} after visiting Liu Yan in the hospital, Director Zhang Yimou said, [...] "I {{feel sorry for}} Liu Yan, my heart is full of regrets, I’m deeply sorry. Liu Yan is a heroine. She sacrificed {{a lot for the}} Olympics, for me, for the opening ceremony." [...] Shortly after the opening ceremony, in an earlier media interview, Zhang expressed: [...] "I regret many things, many details of this performance, many <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done better.

"We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I threw my arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a lot of <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I probably got more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way. I thought I was doing the right thing by changing things, but it didn’t work... Nowadays I would’ve had a shoulder operation... I got told I could have one, but it was really up to me to organise.” ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, Barbeau starred as Carol Traynor, the {{daughter}} of Bea Arthur's title character on the comedy series Maude, which ran from 1972 to 1978 (actress Marcia Rodd had originated the role of Carol in a 1972 episode of All in the Family, also titled [...] "Maude", alongside Arthur). [...] In her autobiography, There Are Worse <b>Things</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Do, Barbeau remarked: [...] "What I didn't know is that when I said [...] I was usually walking {{down a flight of}} stairs and no one was even listening to me. They were just watching my breasts precede me." [...] During the last season of Maude, Barbeau did not appear in the majority of the episodes. In a 2009 Entertainment Tonight TV interview, Barbeau mentioned that she had good on- and off-camera chemistry with Arthur; she said that the two stayed close until Arthur's death on April 25, 2009. Barbeau and Arthur reunited on camera during a 2007 taping of The View, reminiscing about their long-running friendship and their years as co-stars on Maude.|$|E
