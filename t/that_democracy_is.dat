25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} {{is based on}} the notion <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E
25|$|His leading {{views on}} {{democracy}} included: “First, Dewey believed <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> an ethical ideal {{rather than merely}} a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making...Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society”. This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{democracy}} is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected {{on and off}} there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.|$|E

2500|$|Creative Democracy is {{advocated}} by American philosopher John Dewey. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity {{building and the}} interaction among the society. Dewey argues <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> {{a way of life}} in his work of [...] "Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us" [...] and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. [...] "The task of democracy", Dewey concludes, [...] "is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute".|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza, in his Tractatus theologico-politicus, {{tried to}} give Van den Enden's {{political}} ideas a foundation in his own philosophy, by pointing out <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> the best form of government [...] "approaching most closely to that freedom which nature grants to every man". Other than Thomas Hobbes, Spinoza posited that Man does not give up the rights he possesses {{in the state of}} Nature to the State, when he enters the social contract. To him therefore leaving Man {{as close as possible to}} that state of Nature is important, and he thinks that democracy accomplishes this best, as it is [...] "the most natural" [...] and [...] "rational" [...] form of government. This theme runs through most Dutch republican doctrine of the 17th century, before resurfacing in the work of the mid-18th-century French republican philosophers, and ultimately in the French Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the article}} [...] "Marxism is a Universal Truth, not a 'Universal Value'" [...] (published in Party Building in 2013) Wang Ningyou states <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> not a {{universal}} value since {{the meaning of}} democracy (and how it should work) changes from which class perspective one has. He claims that the two main forms of democracy, socialist democracy (proletarian democracy) and capitalist democracy (bourgeoisie democracy) are both diametrically opposite; socialist democracy allows the people to master their own affairs while capitalist democracy, Wang contends, [...] "guarantees the freedom of capital to exploit and suppress [...] ". The use of qualifiers {{in front of the}} word of democracy is important as to highlight the class nature of the different forms of democracy Wang contends, and concludes that [...] "One sort of pure democracy, common democracy or 'universal democracy' that all of humanity identifies with has never existed in human societies".|$|E

2500|$|During that interval, Nae Ionescu and his Cuvântul {{were moving}} to the far right, {{aligning}} themselves with the fascist Iron Guard. Tudor criticized the Trăiristss sympathy for radical solutions, either fascist or communist, defending Romania's young democracy. In a December 1933 issue of Credința, he reacted: [...] "We say <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> not the good thing for us, yet we have never even truly implemented it". Writing from a Christian perspective, Tudor accused Romania's revolutionary youth of [...] "monkeying" [...] foreign experiments in totalitarianism, describing Adolf Hitler as the Antichrist, and equating all revolutionary ideologies with the triumph of [...] "animality". Tudor and Eliade were among the 31 Christian and Jewish Romanian intellectuals to have signed a protest against antisemitism in general and against Nazism in particular.

2500|$|Evidence that is {{consistent}} with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Recent statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. Neither is there convincing evidence that increased reliance on oil revenues prevents democratisation, despite a vast theoretical literature on [...] "the Resource Curse" [...] that asserts that oil revenues sever the link between citizen taxation and government accountability, seen as the key to representative democracy. The lack of evidence for these conventional theories of democratisation have led researchers to search for the [...] "deep" [...] determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic. More inclusive institutions lead to democracy because as people gain more power, they are able to demand more from the elites, who in turn have to concede more things to keep their position. This virtuous circle, may end up in democracy.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Harald Wydra, in {{his book}} Communism and The Emergence of Democracy (2007), {{maintains}} {{that the development of}} democracy should not be viewed as a purely procedural or as a static concept but rather as an ongoing [...] "process of meaning formation". Drawing on Claude Lefort's idea of the empty place of power, that [...] "power emanates from the people [...] but is the power of nobody", he remarks <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> reverence to a symbolic mythical authority as in reality, {{there is no such thing}} as the people or demos. Democratic political figures are not supreme rulers but rather temporary guardians of an empty place. Any claim to substance such as the collective good, the public interest or the will of the nation is subject to the competitive struggle and times of for gaining the authority of office and government. The essence of the democratic system is an empty place, void of real people which can only be temporarily filled and never be appropriated. The seat of power is there, but remains open to constant change. As such, what [...] "democracy" [...] is or what is [...] "democratic" [...] progresses throughout history as a continual and potentially never ending process of social construction.|$|E

It is time to abandon the excuses that are made to avoid {{the hard work of}} {{democracy}}. There are those who say <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> being imposed. It is tyranny that must be imposed. People choose democracy freely. And successful reform is always homegrown. Just look around the world today. For the first time in history, more people are citizens of democracies than of any other form of government. This is the result of choice, not of coercion. There are those who say that democracy leads to chaos, or conflict, or terror. In fact, the opposite is true: Freedom and democracy are the only ideas powerful enough to overcome hatred, and division, and violence. For people of diverse races and religions, the inclusive nature of democracy can lift {{the fear of}} difference that some believe is a license to kill. But people of goodwill must choose to embrace the challenge of listening, and debating, and cooperating with one another. For neighboring countries with turbulent histories, democracy can help to build trust and settle old disputes with dignity. But leaders of vision and character must commit themselves to the difficult work that nurtures the hope of peace. And for all citizens with grievances, democracy can be a path to lasting justice. But the democratic system cannot function if certain groups have one foot in the realm of politics and one foot in the camp of terror." ...|$|E
