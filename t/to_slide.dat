40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study is to compare, in vitro, the {{resistance}} <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> generated by conventional, active self-ligating and passive self-ligating brackets with stainless steel and nickel-titanium wires and to evaluate the effects of binding. Moreover, the influence of bracket slot surface roughness on friction was estimated. MethodsConventional, active and passive self-ligating brackets were coupled with 0. 016 in. × 0. 022 in. stainless steel or nickel-titanium archwires at 0 ° or 5 ° of tipping for evaluating maximum resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> An optical 3 -dimensional micro coordinate system was used to assess roughness characteristics of slot surface. Resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> data was subjected to Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney and Student's t-test (α= 0. 05). Spearman correlation was performed to statistical dependence evaluation. ResultsStatistically significant higher resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> is observed in conventional brackets comparing to self-ligating brackets. No statistically significant differences were found between passive and active types and between archwire alloys at 0 ° angulations. At 5 °, stainless steel showed statistically significant higher resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> No statistically significant differences were found between 0 ° and 5 ° of bracket tipping. The correlation between surface roughness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> was not statistically significant. ConclusionsSelf-ligating brackets appear to have an advantage regarding low frictional forces comparing to conventional brackets. Slight bracket angulations or tooth tipping may not have a significant influence on resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> although different alloys may exhibit dissimilar frictional behavior. It remains unclear if developing smooth slot surfaces should be a concern for manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} use of {{logistic regression}} and analysis tools {{implemented in the}} Geographic Information System (GIS) environment for landslide susceptibility assessment. As a case study, the middle part of the Chriby Mountains (Czech Republic) widely affected by landslides was selected, with a total area of 147 km 2. The landslide susceptibility assessment {{is based on the}} comparison and statistical elaboration of territorial dependence on input factors influencing the instability of the slopes. In this study, the lithology, slope angle, distance to stream, hypsographic level, and the current land cover were evaluated as the factors influencing slope stability and their susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> The comparison shows that the high susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> is primarily in the areas of potential landslides and active, while 62 % of existing slope failures are created in areas highly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>sliding,</b> 32 % are in areas susceptible <b>to</b> moderate <b>sliding.</b> The remaining 6 % of the landslides are located in low areas prone <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> This may be the accumulation parts of landslide bodies. An overall assessment of the 33 % of the area can be classified as having a high degree of susceptibility <b>to</b> the <b>sliding</b> surface and 35 % as moderately susceptible to landsliding. Low degree of susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> represents the remaining 32 % area of the territory...|$|R
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E

40|$|Friction, binding and {{notching}} are {{the factors}} that contribute <b>to</b> resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> during orthodontic tooth movement. However, most attempts at reducing resistance aim only to reduce the archwire/ligature friction. In this study, a novel bracket with a unique design aimed to reduce all three components of resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> Four types of brackets (passive and active self-ligating, traditionally ligated and the novel bracket, (n= 5, each) were tested at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 ᵒ of tip on a 0. 019 x 0. 025 ”archwire. The resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> values were recorded. At 0 ᵒ, the passive self-ligating and novel bracket showed reduced resistance {{when compared to the}} traditionally ligated bracket (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). At the other angles of tip, no differences were observed among the brackets. These data suggest that the novel bracket could potentially decrease the resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> during orthodontic treatment and further studies are indicated to test the improved bracket design...|$|R

5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces).

With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E

5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. Testing was suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up testing was undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16.

Wire alloy, bracket material, surface modification, and roughness have been investigated[2, 12, 18 – 27], revealing that as the angle between the bracket and the archwire increases, the clearance between the archwire and the bracket slot is reduced. In this situation, binding occurs and in turn influences resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding,</b> creating an active configuration[15, 28]. The active configuration itself, however, has received considerably less attention.|$|R

The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman, causing Carpentier <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> down the track and hit the inside wall. Ken Schrader was close by the incident but swerved to avoid damaging his car. During the caution, the leading drivers, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap-165 restart. Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside {{each other in a}} battle for second place on lap 166, until Biffle escaped and ran onto the apron on the next lap. Mayfield burst his right-front tire on lap 171, but no debris came off his car, avoiding the need for a caution. Six laps later, Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place. Riggs experienced oversteer in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte; Franchitti ran into Riggs, causing the sixth caution on lap 179. All of the leaders, including Kenseth, elected to make pit stops for tires. Earnhardt led the field on the lap-183 restart; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards. Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188. Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, John Carmack, a game {{programmer}} for the Gamer's Edge {{video game}} subscription service and disk magazine at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana, developed {{a way to}} create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a computer game. At the time, IBM-compatible general-purpose computers {{were not able to}} replicate the common feat of video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, which were capable of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack created adaptive tile refresh: a way <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the player moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker Tom Hall, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recent Super Mario Bros. 3 on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of Mario with Dangerous Dave, a character from an eponymous previous Gamer's Edge game—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning on September 20, the resulting game, Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement, was shown to their other coworker John Romero. Romero recognized Carmack's idea as a major accomplishment: Nintendo {{was one of the most}} successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their Mario franchise, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications.|$|E
5|$|Kubica had {{problems}} when running the soft compound tyre managing seventh but {{was happy with}} his lap in the final part of qualifying. He was ahead of Massa in the faster of the two Ferrari cars. Petrov secured ninth in the slower Renault car. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten fastest qualifiers. Sutil was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session in eleventh; his best time of 1:27.525 was eight tenths of a second slower than Vettel's pace in the second session. Alonso recorded the twelfth fastest time and could not secure {{a position in the}} final session as his car touched a white line under braking on the circuit, causing his car <b>to</b> <b>slide.</b> Nevertheless, Alonso thought that the error did not cost him time. He was followed by Pedro de la Rosa in the other Sauber car in 13th, who in turn, was ahead of Sébastien Buemi for Torro Rosso and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. This formation continued on the eighth row of the grid, which was occupied by Jaime Alguersuari in the second Torro Rosso and Nico Hülkenberg in the other Williams. Vitantonio Liuzzi failed to move beyond the first session; the Force India driver qualified in 18th. The Lotus cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli lined up in 19th and 20th respectively. Timo Glock and Bruno Senna lined up on the eleventh row of the grid, with their teammates Lucas di Grassi and Karun Chandhok qualifying {{at the rear of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher was {{the fastest}} driver not {{to advance to}} the final session, {{qualifying}} eleventh; his best time of 1:15.026 was nearly two seconds slower than Alonso's fastest time in the second session. He had been one tenth of a second quicker than his teammate Rosberg in the first session; Rosberg's lap caused Schumacher to be eliminated from qualifying and the latter stated he had brake problems. Kamui Kobayashi qualified in 12th after he encountered slower cars which forced him to reduce his speed, and his tyre temperatures dropped which resulted in a loss of grip. He was followed by Petrov in the 13th position. Sutil was afflicted with a lack of grip in his Force India which caused him <b>to</b> <b>slide</b> sideways. However Sutil was penalised five positions because this team changed his gearbox following his driveshaft failure in the final practice session. As a result, de la Rosa inherited 14th, and was ahead of the Toro Rosso drivers (Jaime Alguersuari in front of Buemi). Jarno Trulli was the quickest driver who was unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and was followed by his Lotus teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Timo Glock was penalised five positions on the grid twice because his team changed his gearbox and fitted a seventh-gear ratio that went undeclared on Friday. Senna took over the 20th place. Liuzzi exited turn 15 to complete his second timed lap, ran over a wet patch of astroturf causing him to lose control of the back-end of his Force India, sending him across the track to make heavy contact with the front of his car. He veered back towards the track and some grass and narrowly avoided collecting Glock. Sakon Yamamoto had a shifting issue on his fastest lap time and took 23rd. Lucas di Grassi had a gearbox problem in his car that was unable to be rectified and completed the field. He was later given a five-place grid penalty for the gearbox change but it had no effect on his starting position.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the type of ligation influences the frictional resistance between stainless steel wire and brackets when the wire is subjected to repeated vertical displacements. Methods: Eight different types of ligation were used to secure a length of stainless steel wire in three stainless steel twin brackets. The wire was subjected to repeated vertical displacements in a simulated extraction space. Eighty per cent of the minimum force required to overcome static friction (F-m) between the wire and brackets {{was applied to the}} wire for eight minutes and any sliding measured. Results: Frictional resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> was least when stainless steel ligatures twisted in a figure 8 pattern until taut then untwisted one quarter turn were used, and greatest when elastomeric modules in a figure 8 pattern (EM 8) were used. The F-m difference between fully engaged standard and Super Slick elastomeric modules was significantly different (p = 0. 007). The frictional resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> fell when the wire was secured with either of these two methods and subjected to vertical displacement loads. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of wire movement between these modules. Conclusion: Repeated vertical displacement reduced the frictional resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding</b> for all methods of ligation except EM 8. The stainless steel twist ligatures demonstrated the lowest frictional resistance <b>to</b> <b>sliding.</b> Nathawut Sirisaowaluk, Olena Kravchuk and Christopher T. C. Ho[URL]...|$|R
