5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their attempts <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war. The Communist victory of China in 1949 {{and the start of}} the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-Communist hysteria being whipped up at the time.|$|E

5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|During {{and shortly}} after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were {{inserted}} into important pre-existing towns <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> subdue the populace. They were usually located near any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structures occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a moat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and their financial and judicial roles. When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11thand 12thcenturies, settlement in those countries was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns was often linked {{with the creation of}} a castle.|$|E

40|$|Constant {{maternal}} hyperglycemia limits, while pulsatile maternal hyperglycemia may enhance, fetal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in sheep. However, {{the impact}} of such different patterns of hyperglycemia {{on the development of}} the fetal β-cell is unknown. We measured {{the impact of}} one week of chronic constant hyperglycemia (CHG, n= 6) versus pulsatile hyperglycemia (PHG, n= 5) versus controls (n= 7) on the percentage of the fetal pancreas staining for insulin (β-cell area), mitotic and apoptotic indices and size of fetal β-cells, and fetal insulin secretion in sheep. Baseline insulin concentrations were higher in CHG fetuses (P< 0. 05) compared <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> PHG. GSIS was lower in the CHG group (P< 0. 005) compared <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> PHG. PHG β-cell area was increased 50 % (P< 0. 05) compared <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> CHG. CHG β-cell apoptosis was increased over 400 % (P< 0. 05) compared <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> PHG. These results indicate that late gestation constant maternal hyperglycemia leads to significant β-cell toxicity (increased apoptosis and decreased GSIS). Furthermore, pulsatile maternal hyperglycemia increases pancreatic β-cell area but did not increase GSIS, indicating decreased β-cell responsiveness. These findings demonstrate differential effects that the pattern of maternal hyperglycemia has on fetal pancreatic β-cell development, which might contribute to later life limitation in insulin secretion...|$|R

5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers gave Empire: Total War {{universal}} acclaim; several critics commended {{it as one}} of {{the foremost}} strategy titles of recent times. Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategic breadth, accurate historical challenges and visual effects. The real-time land battles, with a far greater focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles, were considered successful. Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game's artificial intelligence and on the real-time naval battles being difficult <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> co-ordinate. The game was a commercial success, topping sales charts within a week of release; nevertheless, several Creative Assembly employees later commented on various issues caused by a perceived early release.|$|E

40|$|Abnormal cytoplasmic pH {{regulation}} during activation in uremic neutrophils. Neutrophils {{isolated from}} ESRF patients demonstrated abnormal cytoplasmic pH changes after FMLP stimulation; the initial cytoplasmic acidification was absent (P < 0. 001 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls)</b> <b>and</b> {{the degree of}} alkalinization enhanced (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> This effect was not due {{to the absence of}} any of the factors associated with acidification in normal PMN since superoxide production was enhanced (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls)</b> <b>and</b> intracellular calcium release was normal. Our observations are not explicable by alterations in the function of the Na:H antiport since the kinetics of antiport activation by cytoplasmic pH were not different in uremic <b>and</b> <b>control</b> cells. Other factors must therefore be important in generating the abnormal pH response to chemotactic factors in uremic PMN. Cells from CAPD patients had some degree of initial acidification (P < 0. 001 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> P < 0. 05 compared to ESRF) and enhanced alkalinization (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> Preincubation of normal PMN in four-hour dwell PDE reproduced the responses of uremic PMN with absent acidification, enhanced alkalinization and enhanced superoxide generation after FMLP stimulation (P < 0. 05 compared <b>to</b> <b>controls).</b> Changes in the control of cytoplasmic pH in stimulated PMN may influence PMN function, and our observations may be relevant to the susceptibility of uremic patients to infection...|$|R

5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E

5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements.

5|$|Before {{the morning}} of 1 September had passed, reports coming into US 2nd Division {{headquarters}} {{made it clear that}} North Koreans had penetrated to the north–south Changnyong-Yongsan road and cut the division in two; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> direct the divided division as two special forces. Accordingly, he placed the division artillery commander, Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes, in command of the northern group. Southward, in the Yongsan area, Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S.

This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>and</b> hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
