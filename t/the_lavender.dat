5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed <b>the</b> <b>lavender</b> hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
5|$|In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue {{receives}} a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak.

5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), <b>The</b> <b>Lavender</b> Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
