5|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{event was}} {{proposed for the}} anniversary, the Moulin à paroles. Thousands gathered on <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>of</b> Abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant texts from Quebec history, including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto. The inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of some government funding for the event. The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E

She played a minor role in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 where she captured one Prussian sailing ship.

5|$|The French tactics were {{sufficient}} to prevent Amherst's army from joining James Wolfe at the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>of</b> Abraham.

The capture of the fort, which had previously repulsed a large British army a year earlier, contributed to the Annus Mirabilis of 1759.|$|E

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made {{their way down the}} coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off on the island of Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> <b>of</b> Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|Born in Caen, Normandy to {{an aristocratic}} family, Michel-Guillaume Hector St. John de Crèvecœur {{received}} a Jesuit {{education at the}} Jesuit Collège Royal de Bourbon. In 1754, having left school, Crèvecœur visited relatives in England where he became engaged; this visit would {{mark the beginning of}} a lifelong admiration for the culture and politics of the country. Shortly after this, possibly due to the death of his fiancée, he joined a French regiment in Canada engaged in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). After being wounded in the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>of</b> Abraham (1759), Crèvecœur resigned his commission and began traveling widely across Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E

Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial industrialization, particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Having {{joined the}} army in 1746, Howe saw {{extensive}} service in the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven Years' War.

5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>of</b> Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as {{a slap in the}} face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took place, there could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E

5|$|In 907, the Khitan {{chieftain}} Abaoji {{succeeded in}} getting himself appointed khaghan of all Khitan tribes in the north, laying the foundations to what would officially become the Liao dynasty. In 936, the Khitan supported the Shanxi rebel Shi Jingtang in his revolt against the Shatuo Turkic Later Tang, which had destroyed the usurpers of the Tang in 923. The Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yelü Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936946), and received the crucial border region known as the Sixteen Prefectures in return. With the Sixteen Prefectures, the Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that controlled access to <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> <b>of</b> northern China, including the main Great Wall line.|$|E

5|$|Mortier {{demonstrated}} his tactical prowess in {{the deployment}} of his small force: he sent all his cavalry to the north to attack the Spanish left; three battalions were sent south between the fort at San Cristóbal and the Spanish right wing; and his remaining six infantry battalions assaulted the Spanish front.

Despite outnumbering the French, the Allied horse ignored orders and immediately fled towards Elvas and Campo Maior. They escaped unscathed, largely because Latour-Maubourg ignored them and instead launched his cavalry against the Spanish infantry line.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> <b>of</b> Abraham, {{also known}} as the Battle of Quebec (Bataille des Plaines d'Abraham, or Première bataille de Québec in French), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on land that was {{originally}} owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.|$|E
