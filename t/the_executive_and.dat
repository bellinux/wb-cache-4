5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>and</b> legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>and</b> judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E

5|$|Clinton won the 1992 presidential {{election}} (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>and</b> legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E

During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>and</b> judicial branches, with some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation The papers first appeared in The Independent Journal on October 27, 1787.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>and</b> legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Madison's plan {{operated}} on several assumptions {{that were not}} seriously challenged. During the deliberations, few raised serious objections to the planned bicameral congress, nor the separate executive function, nor the separate judicial function. As English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions, law making embodied in the legislature, and law executing embodied in the king and his courts, {{the division of the}} legislature from <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>and</b> judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.|$|E

The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, providing for the direct election of these officers instead.|$|E
