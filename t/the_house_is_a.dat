The house was built around 1750 by Nathaniel Backus and served as his home, it was later moved to its current {{location}} in 1952. The house originally began as a Colonial, but was greatly modified to Greek Revival around 1825, reconfiguring the central door {{to the left of}} the facade and adding two chimneys. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> historic house museum operated by the Faith Trumbull Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built over the old cloisters and the main rooms are on the first floor. It is a stone house with stone slated roofs, twisted chimney stacks and mullioned windows. Throughout {{the life of the}} building, many {{architectural}} alterations, additions, and renovations have occurred so that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mish-mash of different periods and styles.

In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E
5|$|Tyntesfield is a Victorian Gothic Revival {{house and}} estate near Wraxall, North Somerset, England. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Grade I listed {{building}} {{named after the}} Tynte baronets, who had owned estates in the area since about 1500. The location was formerly that of a 16th-century hunting lodge, which {{was used as a}} farmhouse until the early 19th century. In the 1830s a Georgian mansion was built on the site, which was bought by English businessman William Gibbs, whose huge fortune came from guano used as fertilizer. In the 1860s Gibbs had the house significantly expanded and remodelled; a chapel was added in the 1870s. The Gibbs family owned the house until the death of Richard Gibbs in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} about 1735 and {{continued}} until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older {{house had been}} transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains the flaws and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, {{but by the time}} of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio's proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{stones and}} {{materials}} were salvaged {{and used to}} rebuild the Hawkins priory in Virginia, the reconstructed house incorporated other designs and influences. Following the acquisition of the Warwickshire property, the Weddells hired chief architect Henry Grant Morse and scouted the English countryside, surveying properties and considering various designs they could incorporate into the rebuilding process. As a result, the reconstruction is not {{a replica of the}} original building. The west wing of the house is actually a replica of Sulgrave Manor, a small manor house in Northamptonshire, England, which once belonged to Lawrence Washington, an ancestor of America's first president, George Washington. However, the center of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reproduction of the original Warwickshire priory and uses the curvilinear gables, strapwork design, and balustrades that the English commonly adapted from the Low Countries in the early seventeenth century. The east wing of the house, however, is based on Wormleighton Manor, a Spencer-Churchill family estate in England.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who trick their {{grandfather}} into letting them throw their own party.

Marge is upset that Homer would choose fishing over their marriage, which Homer fails to understand as he visualizes Marge {{turning into a}} catfish. Homer takes a walk instead of returning to bed. On the dock, he finds an abandoned fishing pole. The pole, with General Sherman on the line, yanks him off the pier into a small rowboat, and onto the lake. From their cabin window, Marge watches Homer battle General Sherman and gets frustrated. At home, Bart and Lisa's party has ended and <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> total mess. Watching Grampa cry and fearing that he will get in trouble, they frantically clean up the house for him.|$|E
