About a half-hour later, the Australian Mounted Division's 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) and two {{artillery}} batteries were also ordered <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the Anzac Mounted Division's attack on Tel el Saba. The horses of the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade were all watered at 13:10 in the Wadi Saba.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial resources of the Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> distant provinces. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E

5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant would cross the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
5|$|After Molly's father died, {{her family}} {{returned}} to Canajoharie. On September 9, 1753, Molly's mother married Brant Kanagaradunkwa, a Mohawk sachem of the Turtle clan.

5|$|After commissioning, Handy and Hearty were renamed Harvester and Hesperus, respectively, {{to avoid}} {{confusion}} with Hardy. The Havant-class destroyers initially formed the 9th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to Western Approaches Command for anti-submarine patrols and escort duty.

5|$|After the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, the Seventh Army began sending infantry units from the divisions in West Germany on a rotating basis <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the Berlin Brigade. The 24th Division's units participated in this action.|$|E
5|$|At 04:00 on 19 May, an NVA platoon {{attacked}} Company H 2/3 Marines {{position on}} Route 9 southeast of Khe Sanh killing 3 Marines {{for the loss}} of 8 dead. Simultaneously Company I 3/4 Marines on Hill 552 was hit by NVA mortar fire, at dawn the Marines attacked the NVA position killing 42 and capturing 4. At 07:10 a platoon from Company F 2/1 Marines supported by 2 tanks on a road sweep operation from KSCB towards Route 9 was ambushed, the Marines attempted to assault the NVA positions but were repulsed. The remainder of Company F was sent <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the platoon but the Marines attack was again repulsed, Company G was then sent <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> Company F and napalm strikes were called in close to the Marine lines forcing the NVA to retreat. Marine losses were 8 dead while NVA losses were 113 killed and 3 captured. Given the increased NVA activity around KSCB, in late May III MAF ordered 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines (3/9 Marines) <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the units in the area.|$|E

5|$|Berryman {{was also}} {{involved}} in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from Lae, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General Ennis Whitehead while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at Finschhafen, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the United States Seventh Fleet did not intend <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> the 9th Division he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> Finschhafen with a battalion in APDs.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier General Wiggin {{ordered the}} Worcestershire Yeomanry to water at Bir el Hamisah and then advance on Katia, but before {{watering}} was complete they saw shells bursting at Katia, and moved off at 09:50 <b>to</b> <b>reinforce</b> {{the line of}} the Gloucester squadron on the left.|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{descriptive}} {{analyses were conducted}} to investigate the phenomena of schedule-induction and the entrainment of challenging behavior <b>to</b> <b>reinforcer</b> presentation in three children with severe mental retardation. One of the three participants exhibited evidence of increased rates of self-injurious behavior under a fixed-interval schedule when compared with no-reinforcer and extinction baselines. Another participant showed evidence of the entrainment of disruptive behavior <b>to</b> <b>reinforcer</b> presentation in both classroom and experimental settings. Results are discussed in relation to previous research and the relationship between schedule-induced, entrained and operant behavior...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{two studies}} extending basic matching research on self-control and impulsivity {{to the investigation}} of choices of students diagnosed as seriously emotionally disturbed. In Study 1 we examined the interaction between unequal rates of reinforcement and equal versus unequal delays <b>to</b> <b>reinforcer</b> access on performance of concurrently available sets of math problems. The results of a reversal design showed that when delays <b>to</b> <b>reinforcer</b> access were the same for both response alternatives, the time allocated to each was approximately proportional to obtained reinforcement. When the delays <b>to</b> <b>reinforcer</b> access differed between the response alternatives, there was a bias toward the response alternative and schedule with the lower delays, suggesting impulsivity (i. e., immediate reinforcer access overrode the effects of rate of reinforcement). In Study 2 we examined {{the interactive effects of}} reinforcer rate, quality, and delay. Conditions involving delayed access to the high-quality reinforcers on the rich schedule (with immediate access to low-quality reinforcers earned on the lean schedule) were alternated with immediate access to low-quality reinforcers on the rich schedule (with delayed access to high-quality reinforcers on the lean schedule) using a reversal design. With 1 student, reinforcer quality overrode the effects of both reinforcer rate and delay <b>to</b> <b>reinforcer</b> access. The other student tended to respond exclusively to the alternative associated with immediate access to reinforcers. The studies demonstrate a methodology based on matching theory for determining influential dimensions of reinforcers governing individuals 2 ̆ 7 choices...|$|R
