40|$|The paper {{systematically}} reviews {{experimental research}} {{on the performance of}} cubic boron nitride (CBN) grinding wheels and discusses advantages and difficulties experienced in the application of CBN wheels particularly for internal grinding with fine-grain wheels. The hardness of CBN grains potentially increases re-dress life and improves dimensional stability. The problem is that increased re-dress life increases the importance of avoiding wheel loading, particularly for small-grain wheels. This paper highlights the importance of <b>touch</b> <b>dressing</b> for improved dimensional stability and other operational techniques to maintain an open surface topography of the wheel. The paper also demonstrates the benefit of an open-structured small-grain CBN wheel for precision grinding. Effects on grinding temperature are also illustrated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaser pulses with a pulsewidth {{of a few}} picoseconds have {{recently}} {{received a lot of}} attention, solving the problem of manufacturing tools for new materials of superior mechanical properties. Processing thermally sensitive material, such as diamond and CBN structures, can be done without major material deterioration effects. The breakthrough of this new technology becomes possible, if the accuracy and life time requirements of those tools are met. The paper shows in three applications the potential of laser manufacturing of cutting tools. Manufacturing of cutting edges for CFRP cutting needs sharp and stable cutting edges, which are prepared in PCD tools by laser sources in the picosecond pulsewidth regime. Profiling of hybrid bond grinding wheels yields geometric flexibility, which is impossible by mechanical treatment so far. <b>Touch</b> <b>dressing</b> of grinding wheels substantially reduces cutting forces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{alternative}} process for dressing electroplated cBN grinding wheels using an ultrashort pulsed laser is presented. Other than abrasive grains <b>dressed</b> conventionally, laser <b>touch</b> <b>dressed</b> cBN grains exhibit cutting edges that have partially defined geometric elements {{with a positive}} clearance angle. Grinding experiments, including long-term tests, are performed on hardened steel, for a comparative study on the performances of laser dressed and conventionally dressed tools. While the processing forces are slightly higher for the laser <b>touch</b> <b>dressed</b> tools, the roughness of the ground surface is improved...|$|R

50|$|Tisci's {{apparent}} {{fascination with}} Gothic <b>touches</b> (dark, languid <b>dresses</b> for fall couture) and space-age minimalism (one ready-to-wear show featured white-clad models drifting around a sterile-white sphere) has drawn new {{attention to the}} Givenchy brand. Reviews and output {{so far have been}} mixed and inconsistent, but many, including influential fashion critics (such as Cathy Horyn of The New York Times and Suzy Menkes of the International Herald Tribune) have honed in on Tisci's conceptual leanings, as well as his future potential for revitalizing the Givenchy brand and infusing it with his precision and imagination.|$|R
50|$|To illustrate, we {{can take}} a {{dressmaker}} who purchased a dress material for 500 rupees, then stitched and put final <b>touches</b> on the <b>dress.</b> She then sold the dress for 800 rupees (her costs of finishing the dress were 150 rupees).We can then say that she added 150 rupees worth of output to the dress, as opposed to saying that she produced 800 rupees worth of output. So value addition is equal to the sales price of a good or service, minus all the non-labour costs used to produce it.|$|R

Aside from visiting the sick, teaching catechism, visiting prisoners and helping to keep the clergy in <b>touch,</b> Marie Th√©r√®se, <b>dressed</b> as a peasant, would enter the offices of the committee of supervision and read the list of planned arrests and executions while pretending to clean the building.

60|$|The Sergeant's next {{proceeding}} was {{to question}} me about any large {{dogs in the}} house who might have got into the room, and done the mischief with a whisk of their tails. Hearing that this was impossible, he next sent for a magnifying-glass, and tried how the smear looked, seen that way. No skin-mark (as of a human hand) printed off on the paint. All the signs visible--signs which told that the paint had been smeared by some loose article of somebody's <b>dress</b> <b>touching</b> it in going by.

60|$|When {{she came}} out at the back she smiled {{straight}} into Ciccio's face, with her sudden, luminous smile. His hand on the mandoline trembled into silence. He sat looking at her with an instant re-establishment of knowledge. And yet she shrank from the long, inscrutable gaze of his black-set, tawny eyes. She resented him a little. And yet she went forward to him and stood so that her <b>dress</b> <b>touched</b> him. And still he gazed up at her, with the heavy, unspeaking look, that seemed to bear her down: he seemed like some creature that was watching her for his purposes. She looked aside at the black garden, which had a wiry goose-berry bush.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Grinstead and her maid {{had taken}} {{charge of the}} damsel's toilette at Rowthorpe, had perhaps <b>touched</b> up her <b>dresses,</b> and had {{certainly}} {{taught her how to}} put them on, and how to manage her hair, so that though it had not broken out into fringes or tousles, as if it were desirable to imitate savages 'with foreheads marvellous low,' the effect was greatly improved. The young brown-skinned, dark-eyed face, and rather tall figure were the same, even the clothes the very same chosen under her aunt Ada's superintendence, but there was an indescribable change, not so much that of fashion as of distinction, and something of the same inward growth might be gathered from her conversation.|$|R
60|$|But the maiden's {{hand had}} hardly <b>touched</b> the <b>dress</b> when the palace {{suddenly}} awoke from its sleep, and the Prince was seized and bound. He was so vexed {{with his own}} folly, and so taken aback at the disaster, {{that he did not}} attempt to explain his conduct, and things would have gone badly with him if his friends the fairies had not softened the hearts of his captors, so that they once more allowed him to leave quietly. However, what troubled him most was the idea of having to meet the Frog who had been his benefactress. How was he ever to appear before her with this tale? Still, after a long struggle with himself, he made up his mind that {{there was nothing else to}} be done, and that he deserved whatever she might say to him. And she said a great deal, for she had worked herself into a terrible passion; but the Prince humbly implored her pardon, and ventured to point out that it would have been very hard to refuse the young lady's reasonable request. 'You must learn to do as you are told,' was all the Frog would reply.|$|R

50|$|The {{first thing}} unique about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat is the {{entrance}} arch. It {{is located at}} the back of the church and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church facade. On the arch is inscribed, Basilica Minore Nuestra Senora De Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). The Basilica has a simple facade flanked to the left by a tall belfry. It is located on top of a hill to avoid flooding brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the Chico River. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is noticeably common among churches in Cagayan Valley, in contrast to other old churches made of limestone and coral stone in other parts of the Philippines. The interiors has curved ceiling made of wood with historical images and accounts at the top of the walls. Enshrined at the altar is the Blessed Virgin Mary covered in a glass case. There are also verandahs inside the church which makes the shrine elegant. At the back of the church is a staircase that leads to a window located behind the case of the Virgin Mary wherein devotees can <b>touch</b> the <b>dress</b> of Our Lady.|$|R
