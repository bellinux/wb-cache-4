5|$|Chinese {{who married}} local Javanese women and {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> created a distinct Chinese Muslim Peranakan community in Java. Chinese rarely had to convert <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount}} of their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} of {{converts}} <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside. This {{was followed by the}} general acceptance of Islam by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions. According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (a prominent Medinan leader) <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> Medinans who converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Kathir in his Al Bidaya Wal Nihayah disregards the above. He {{stated that}} the first woman <b>to</b> embrace <b>Islam</b> was Khadijah. Zaid bin Haarithah was the first freed slave <b>to</b> embrace <b>Islam.</b> And Ali ibn abi talib was the first child <b>to</b> embrace <b>Islam</b> for he has not even {{reached the age of}} puberty at the time. And Abu Bakr was the first free man <b>to</b> embrace <b>Islam.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hardly any Zoroastrian {{family was}} able to avoid {{conversion}} <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> when employed by the Abbasids. Because of their harshness towards unbelievers, and due to their lavish patronage of Persian Muslims, the Abbasids proved to be deadly foes of Zoroastrianism.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{intolerance}} was {{one particular}} {{factor in the}} decline of the Pax Mongolica. In Rus', the Mongols (known as the Golden Horde), gradually lost power and territory due to intolerance specifically geared towards different religions. The Rus' Mongols converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and joined the Egyptian Mamluks for political reasons. At one point in the war the Golden Horde even fought the Persian Mongols. The eastern part of the Golden Horde, White Horde, had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan. The decentralisation occurred because communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes. Eventually, the Persian Mongol leader Ghazan converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> in 1295. This contributed to the growing power of Nawruz; a Muslim Oirat general.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided {{closely with the}} rise of various Hindu proselytizing movements such as Shuddhi (purification) and Sanghatan (consolidation) which launched massive efforts {{in the early twentieth century}} to reconvert Hindus who had converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and Christianity.|$|E

5|$|The men – {{numbering}} between 400 and 900 – {{were bound}} and {{placed under the}} custody of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, while {{the women and children}} were placed under Abdullah ibn Salam, a former rabbi who had converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{the first}} four Caliphs, Persia {{remained}} predominantly Zoroastrian. Zoroastrians were awarded the status of People of the Book or dhimmi status by the Caliph Umar, although some practices contrary <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> were prohibited.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{scholars}} Ivan Yastrebov and Pavel Rovinski, {{the cross}} was originally {{kept in the}} Prečista Krajinska Church, in which Kosara had interred Vladimir. The peak of Islamization of the Krajina region was reached {{at the end of}} 18th century. The church was torn down, though it is uncertain when and by whom, but the cross was preserved by the people of the region. They believed that it could protect against evil and ensure a rich harvest, and kept it as sacred, although they had converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> The cross was later taken from them by the neighboring clan of Mrkojevići. As they too converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam,</b> they entrusted the cross to the Andrović family—their Orthodox Christian neighbors. The Mrkojevići considered it more appropriate for the cross to be kept in a Christian home, rather than in a Muslim one.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2002 census, 68.5% of the {{population}} of Skopje belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church, while 28.6% of it belonged <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> The city also had a Catholic (0.5%) and Protestant (0.04%) minorities. The Catholics are served by the Latin bishopric of Skopje, in which is also vested the Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence. Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by the tax collectors. Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{scholars}} like Surendranath Sen, Mohibbul Hasan, N. K. Sinha, and B. Sheik Ali, who have analysed Tipu's religious policies on Christians, conclude {{that he was}} not a religious bigot. They argue that forcible conversions <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> were done purely for political, not religious reasons. Forced conversions were carried out as a punishment for Christians who supported the British against their own native suzerain. The conversions came after many warnings by Tippu.|$|E

5|$|During the occupation, {{approximately}} 4,000 {{children were}} forcibly {{removed from their}} families by Indonesian soldiers {{as well as by}} state and religious organizations. Although some were well-treated, others were subjected to various forms of abuse, including sexual abuse.

5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E

50|$|The Majlis-ash-Shura has the {{authority}} to remove a Khalifa if he behaves contrary <b>to</b> <b>Islam's</b> Akhlaq (practice of morality). In effect, removal is only expected in cases of oppression, and the Majlis-ash-Shura is to discreetly inform the Khalifa of his problematic actions beforehand.|$|R

5|$|In 2003, media sources carried {{reports that}} O'Sullivan had {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>Islam,</b> but despite his self-professed {{interest in the}} faith, these reports were proved to be false. O'Sullivan also espouses an interest in Buddhism, having spent many lunchtimes at the London Buddhist Centre in Bethnal Green. However, he denies having a firm commitment to any religion.|$|E
5|$|In May 629, Khalid {{set out for}} Medina. On the way he met 'Amr ibn al-'As and Uthman ibn Talhah, {{who were}} also going to Medina to convert <b>to</b> <b>Islam.</b> They arrived at Medina on 31 May 629 {{and went to the}} house of Muhammad. Khalid was {{received}} by his elder brother Walid bin al-Walid and was first among the three men to enter Islam.|$|E
5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of the conversion of the khagan <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted <b>to</b> <b>Islam</b> and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The conversion of the khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E
