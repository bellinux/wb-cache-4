He then did not play again until 1901, when in four innings he totalled just eight runs, and after <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> gap until the above-mentioned 1904 season. After that year, he was to play just one more game, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in July 1907.|$|E
25|$|The Cappella Maggiore derived its name, the Greater Chapel, {{from the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> chapel also in use by the Pope and his retinue for daily worship. At the time of Pope Sixtus IV, this was the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V, which had been {{decorated}} by Fra Angelico. The Cappella Maggiore is recorded as existing in 1368. According to a communication from Andreas of Trebizond to Pope Sixtus IV, {{by the time of}} its demolition {{to make way for the}} present chapel, the Cappella Maggiore was in a ruinous state with its walls leaning.|$|E

Claude was a nightclub singer in his spare time and was {{acknowledged}} as the singer of the Montreal organization. When he was young he started out by working as a door-man for the Mafia, which gave him a foot in the door of the criminal underworld as the Cotroni began to weaken it allowed him to expand his work into strip clubs and bars. He ran his empire very efficiently and would insure regular meetings {{to make sure he was}} on top of everything. Claude was very active in the downtown drug trafficking trade along with his brother Adrien.

25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E
25|$|After {{discovering}} {{a photo of}} Mrs. DiLaurentis with Jason and another boy, Alison and Jason found out that they had an older brother that was, in fact, Charles. Kenneth explains that Charles tried to hurt Alison {{when she was a}} kid; he was subsequently admitted to Radley for diagnosis, and he died when he was 16. The Liars then searched Radley for answers, discovering <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> person who visited Charles in Radley: Alison's great aunt Carol. Alison, Jason, Hanna, and Spencer later discover Charles' grave in her backyard. Meanwhile, Mona later returns to Rosewood, heavily questioned by the police about her actions while her friendship with Lesli is strained because of her involvement with Mona's actions. It is later revealed that Lesli was a former patient at Radley, and was roommates with Bethany Young, leading the girls to suspect that Lesli may be 'A'. Mona, however, tells them that Lesli is only pretending to be stable and that Charles faked his own death.|$|E

500|$|Eadbald had a sister, Æthelburg, who was {{probably}} also {{the child of}} Bertha. Æthelburg married Edwin, King of Northumbria, one of the dominant Anglo-Saxon kings of the seventh century. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> brother, named Æthelwald: the evidence for this is a papal letter to Justus, archbishop of Canterbury from 619 to 625, in which a king named Aduluald is referred to, and who is apparently different from Audubald, which refers to Eadbald. There is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this: [...] "Aduluald" [...] might be intended as a representation of [...] "Æthelwald", and hence this may be an indication of another king, perhaps a subking of west Kent; {{or it may be}} merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to Eadbald.|$|E
500|$|Argon ( [...] , neuter {{singular}} form of , meaning [...] "inactive", {{in reference}} to its chemical inactivity) was suspected to be a component of air by Henry Cavendish in 1785. [...] Argon was first isolated from air in 1894 by Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay at University College London by removing oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen from a sample of clean air. They had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was 0.5% lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere. The difference was slight, but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months. They concluded <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> gas in the air {{mixed in with the}} nitrogen. Argon was also encountered in 1882 through independent research of H. F. Newall and W. N. Hartley. Each observed new lines in the emission spectrum of air that did not match known elements. Argon was the first noble gas to be discovered. Until 1957, the symbol for argon was [...] "A", but now is [...] "Ar".|$|E

Mulder and Krycek arrive, but not before two gunshots are heard from the room where Cole is believed to be. It appears that the two officers in the room with him shot each other. Cole escapes. Mulder believes that Cole's years of sleeplessness have provided him with illusionary abilities. Mulder and Krycek meet with Matola soon afterwards, who says that he has not slept in twenty-four years due to the experiment. He reveals <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> doctor who was part of the squad, Dr. Girardi, and that {{he was the one who}} actually performed the lobotomies.|$|E
