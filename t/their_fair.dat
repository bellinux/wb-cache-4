5|$|In 1595 Żółkiewski {{participated in}} the Moldavian {{campaign}} and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river. The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko. Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations with them. When the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, {{which led to a}} deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo.|$|E

50|$|Basel were {{qualified}} for the 1964-65 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup {{and in the first}} round they played CA Spora Luxembourg.

5|$|The {{expedition}} made Rogers {{a national}} hero, but {{his brother was}} killed and Rogers was badly wounded in fights in the Pacific. On his return, he was successfully sued by his crew {{on the grounds that}} they had not received <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> share of the expedition profits, and Rogers was forced into bankruptcy. He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book A Cruising Voyage Round the World, which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk's rescue.|$|E
5|$|In 1619, King James I {{decreed that}} the American colonists of Jamestown {{would need to}} step up efforts to do <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> share towards {{supporting}} England. The Virginia Company enacted the decree, asking Jamestown's land owners to grow and export 100 hemp plants to help support England's cause. Later the colonists would grow it to support its expansion in the Americas. George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon {{as one of his}} three primary crops. The use of hemp for rope and fabric later became ubiquitous throughout the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States. Medicinal preparations of cannabis became available in American pharmacies in the 1850s following an introduction to its use in Western medicine by William O'Shaughnessy a decade earlier in 1839.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{was still}} at Hibs for <b>their</b> <b>Fairs</b> Cup 1st round exit to Valencia. Hibs won 2–0 at home, but a defeat by the same margin in Spain meant a play off, which Hibs lost 3–0.

60|$|These five, {{ranging from}} fifteen to nineteen, were fond of {{rambling}} {{through the woods}} in company, being not only the older members of the young flock, but like-minded in many things.

25|$|For {{taxable income}} {{consisting}} of salary and benefits, employers {{are required to}} make the necessary tax deductions from their employees’ payroll and submit them to the tax authorities.

25|$|Women {{generally}} {{spent hours}} a day queuing for what little food was available, sometimes using the waiting time to do knitting, often getting to the front to find nothing was left, then after collecting sticks and water from a well, using ingenuity and time preparing a meal, with the man (and if there were children those also), eating more than <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> share.|$|E

60|$|The {{land was}} very cold and foggy, they said, so foggy that {{sometimes}} {{people could not}} see each other for whole days, and in it dwelt a race of great men covered with hair, who sacrificed strangers to a snake which they worshipped, and married all <b>their</b> <b>fairest</b> maidens to a god. That was all they knew {{of the country and}} of the great men, for few who visited there ever returned to tell tidings. It was certainly a haunted land.|$|R
60|$|But {{what if the}} wasp tribe had no captives? They {{would offer}} slaves. What if the agony and death of slaves did not appease the wasps? They would offer <b>their</b> <b>fairest,</b> <b>their</b> dearest, their sons and their daughters, to the wasps; as the Carthaginians, in like strait, offered in one day 200 noble boys to Moloch, the volcano- god, whose worship they had brought out of Syria; whose {{original}} meaning they had probably forgotten; of whom they only {{knew that he was}} a dark and devouring being, who must be appeased with the burning bodies of their sons and daughters. And so the veil of fancy would be lifted again, and the whole superstition stand forth revealed as the mere offspring of bodily fear.|$|R
25|$|Farmers' organisations {{that use}} their social premium for public goods often finance {{educational}} scholarships. For example, Costa Rican coffee co-operative, Coocafé, has supported {{hundreds of children}} and youth at school and university through the financing of scholarships from funding from <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> trade social premium. In terms of education, the social premium {{can be used to}} build and furnish schools too.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, some {{criticize the}} {{implementation}} of ACP {{as a violation of}} <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> use rights. A recently developed TV-streaming product called the Slingbox uses analog signals to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes. On one or more accounts, students {{have not been able to}} cite and record cable sources properly due to ACP restrictions.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2006 Gallup poll, 84% {{of investors}} believe that illegal {{immigrants}} mostly take low paying jobs that Americans do not want. However, nearly 62% of investors say {{illegal immigration is}} hurting the investment climate. 68% of investors say that illegal immigrants cost taxpayers too much because they use government services like public education and medical services, while 25% {{say that in the}} long run, illegal immigrants become productive citizens who come to make up paying <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> share of taxes. About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|E

Nevertheless, it remains the club's best European run.|$|R

25|$|In August 1940, Ribbentrop {{oversaw the}} Second Vienna Award, which saw about 40% of the Transylvania region of Romania {{returned}} to Hungary. The decision to award {{so much of}} Romania to the Hungarians was Hitler's, as Ribbentrop himself {{spent most of the}} Vienna conference loudly attacking the Hungarian delegation for their coolness towards attacking Czechoslovakia in 1938 and then demanding more than <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> share of the spoils. When Ribbentrop finally got around to announcing his decision, the Hungarian delegation, which had expected Ribbentrop to rule in favour of Romania, broke out in cheers, while the Romanian foreign minister Mihail Manoilescu fainted.|$|E
25|$|Kyary {{was raised}} in a {{traditional}} strict household, where her parents frequently set early curfews and limited her cell phone access. Her mother was very critical of her fashion sense, to the point where Kyary would have to leave the house dressed normally, and change into Harajuku-style clothing inside a public restroom. She would often return home to find that her mother had disposed of her fashion accessories, which led to further quarrels. She writes in her autobiography, Oh! My God!! Harajuku Girl that her father was more supportive of her, although they had <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> share of quarrels as well.|$|E
25|$|During the Mexican Revolution, Álvaro Obregón {{invited a}} group of Canadian German-speaking Mennonites to resettle in Mexico. By the late 1920s, some 7,000 had immigrated to Chihuahua State and Durango State, almost all from Canada, only a few from the U.S. and Russia. Today, Mexico {{accounts}} for about 42% of all Mennonites in Latin America. Mennonites in the country stand out because of <b>their</b> <b>fair</b> skin, hair, and eyes. They are a largely insular community that speaks a form of German and wear traditional clothing. They own their own businesses in various communities in Chihuahua, and account for {{about half of the}} state's farm economy, excelling in cheese production.|$|E
50|$|The BMW G650X was {{a series}} of {{motorcycles}} produced from 2006 to 2009. The three models were: the G650 Xchallenge, the G650 Xmoto, and the G650 Xcountry. The same updated Rotax engine first seen on the BMW F650 was shared among the three models. The single-cylinder, four-stroke, 652cc engine was liquid-cooled and features DOHC. The 652cc engine produced 53 hp and 60 Nm of power and torque at 7000 and 5250 RPM respectively. The three models shared all major components and are differentiated by <b>their</b> <b>fairing</b> and wheel sizes, therefore, the models vary in weight.|$|R
