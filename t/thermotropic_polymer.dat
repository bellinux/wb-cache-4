40|$|ABSTRACT: The phase behavior, rheology, and {{morphology}} of binary blends of semiflexible main-chain <b>thermotropic</b> liquid-crystalline <b>polymers</b> (TLCPs) were investigated. Specifically, binary blends {{consisting of}} poly[(phenylsulfonyl) -p-phenylene alkylene-bis(4 -oxybenzoate) ]s (PSHQn) having five methylene groups (PSHQ 5) and 11 methylene groups (PSHQ 11) were prepared by solvent casting. It was found from {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) that PSHQ 5, PSHQ 11, and their blends are glassy <b>thermotropic</b> <b>polymers,</b> exhibiting only glass-to-nematic and nematic-to-isotropic (N-I) transitions. Approximate phase diagrams were constructed for PSHQ 5 /PSHQ 11 blends based on DSC data. Using a cone-and-plate rheometer, transient shear flow experiments were conducted for the PSHQ 5 /PSHQ 11 blends (i) at 160 °C in the biphasic region where PSHQ 11 forms an isotropic phase and PSHQ 5 forms a nematic phase and (ii) at 130 °C in the nematic region where both PSHQ 5 and PSHQ 11 formed the nematic phase. It was found for such PSHQ 5 /PSHQ 11 blends that the steady-state shear viscosity at 130 °C (in the nematic region) is lower than that at 160 °C (in the biphasic region). However, the first normal stress difference at 130 °C exhibits a very large overshoot followed by an oscillatory decay until reaching a steady state, while it is virtually zero at 160 °C. The time evolution of morphology for the PSHQ 5 /PSHQ 11 blends, upon shear startup and also upon cessation of shear flow, was investigated using a specially designe...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{blending}} a TLCP with <b>thermotropic</b> <b>polymer</b> {{results in a}} dramatic decrease in the melt viscosity. Under proper processing conditions, the TLCP droplets can deform and elongate according to deformability of a suspension medium. The viscosity ratio {{plays a key role}} in determining the form of microdroplets of the liquid crystalline phase. This means that the blend has to be processed in a suitable temperature range, in order to control the viscosity ratio of the different phases. In this case the liquid crystalline phase can segregate as fibers with high aspect ratio in the host matrix. For the mechanical properties of the spun blend, the usual models valid for the composites can be succesfully applied. However, attention should be devoted to the evaluation of the modulus of the oriented liquid crystalline phase in the blend, that in many cases is lower if compared to that of the pure oriented mesophastic polymer.

40|$|The optical {{evolution}} of the band texture occurring in acetoxypropylcellulose <b>thermotropic</b> <b>polymer</b> has been investigated {{as a function of}} temperature and primary shear rate. Two distinct kinds of band texture were observed which are referred to here as the `fast' and `slow' band textures with regard to their rate of evolution.

The evolution behaviour of the fast band texture is interpreted in terms of the shifting of a three-region evolution curve.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The local ordering, morphology, and {{dynamics}} of aromatic cores and flexible alkyl spacers were analyzed for a homologous series of main-chain polymeric liquid crystals. 13 C NMR experiments {{showed that the}} nematic ordering achieved by these synthetic polymers was retained into the solid state if their quenchings occur while remaining within the strong NMR magnetic field. The degree of orientation in the resulting glasses was investigated by variable-angle NMR experiments and found to differ between polymers with an even number of methylene units in the flexible spacer vs those with an odd number. To further discern at a molecular level {{the nature of these}} differences, the structures of these polyesters were examined by high-resolution solid-state 13 C NMR. It was found that while the odd-chained series displayed a conformational annealing upon aligning, even-chained polymers were generally in all-trans conformations both for as-synthesized and for aligned samples. Variable-temperature 1 D and 2 D NMR experiments also illustrated substantial differences in the degree of motional dynamics between the odd and even polymer series: whereas considerable rigidity was exhibited by the even-numbered series {{all the way up to}} 150 °C, a relatively high flexibility displayed by the odd-methylene polymers.

40|$|The syntheses of {{a series}} of new thermotropic liquid {{crystalline}} homopolymers, copolymers, and polymer blends, as well as their monomers were discussed. These polymers were prepared from 1, 10 -decane bisterephthaloyl chloride and substituted hydroquinones, and had a general structure as follows:^ ^^^^^ where X = (CH(, 2)) (,(eta)) -H; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, [...] , 10. ^ or X = Br, -CN, -NO(, 2), -OCH(, 3). ^^ In the copolymers, X was either -CN or -OCH(, 3) of different ratios. ^ The structures and the thermotropic properties of these polymers were characterized by inherent viscosity measurements, gel permeation chromotagraphy, (2 ̆ 713) C-NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, and polarizing microscopy observations. ^ All of the polymers had fairly low melting temperatures, which were desirable for <b>thermotropic</b> liquid crystalline <b>polymers,</b> and most of them had a mesophase (very likely nematic) above the melting point. As an example, the ethyl-substituted polymer had a melting point of 71 (DEGREES) C and an isotropization temperature of 127 (DEGREES) C. ^ The substituent effects on the thermotropic behavior of these polymers were systematically studied in terms of both steric and polar effects. Increasing the size of the substituents resulted in the decrease of the thermal stability of the mesophase, while the higher polarity of the substituents resulted in a higher stability. With some success a theoretical treatment was developed which partly answered the questions which arose from the different behavior of polymers with different substituents; for example, why the methoxy-substituted polymer was (to the author 2 ̆ 7 s suprise) non-liquid-crystalline. ^ The copolymerization of monomers with different substituents was found to {{be a good way to}} lower the melting point of the polymers. Copolymerization also caused a steady change in the mesophase thermal stability with changing composition of the copolymers. ^ Observations on the optical microscopy revealed that no phase separation occurred in the mesophases of the blends formed from two different <b>thermotropic</b> <b>polymers.</b> However, the liquid crystalline polymers were immiscible with a non-liquid-crystalline polymer, and consequently both phase separations and phase inversions were observed with changing combination of the two components of these blends. ...|$|R
