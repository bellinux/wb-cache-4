5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

The rakish stylization and the {{succulent}} color were easy to enjoy, and the payoff was sanguinely erotic in a way that endorsed my personal wishes to be bold and tender and noble, overcoming the wimp <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>In</b> that moment, I used up Modigliani's value for my life. But in museums ever since I have been happy to salute his pictures with residually grateful, quick looks.|$|E
500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E

A guy that's been a lifer in prison has a different attitude toward life and death." [...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating thing for me was that Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet. I didn't get any of <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a skintight rubber suit. Had I been 23, I would have been much happier, but at 49?" ...|$|E

The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that {{it makes me want to}} throw up. ...I adapted to survive my circumstance." [...] said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.|$|E
500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's morning again in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that [...] "I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> for it with Reagan" [...] and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.|$|E

500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. And even if I did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E
500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... {{it never occurred to me}} that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E
500|$|In November 1821, {{shortly before}} his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was {{articled}} as a clerk to a firm of solicitors—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the City of London. T F Maples {{was not only the}} young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was [...] "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including Robert Blake and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, [...] "I had some scruples, for even then I dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was 'Philip Carteret Webb', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It {{would be a mistake to}} suppose that the two years and more <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, though I have often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse." ...|$|E

500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a lot of danger." ...|$|E
