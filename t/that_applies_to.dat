5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule <b>that</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result <b>that</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> H-coloring problems for directed graphs H applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E

5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework <b>that</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E
5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier <b>that</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system <b>that</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E
