500|$|Peirsol {{qualified}} {{for his first}} Olympics {{at the age of}} seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event, finishing 4th. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke. Afterwards Peirsol said, [...] "I think I'm getting to a point where I'm becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Green Bay Packer quarterback Aaron Rodgers criticized Kornheiser's {{performance}} on Monday Night Football, saying: [...] "He's terrible...I don’t think he’s funny. I don’t think he’s insightful. I don’t <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows,</b> really, anything about sports.”. Rodgers also criticized ESPN analyst Ron Jaworski and other ESPN employees during the interview. Kornheiser responded {{in an interview}} by saying: [...] "If he thinks I’m no good, he wouldn’t be the first. Or the last.” and [...] "I tried to establish some rapport with that. I guess that rapport didn’t exist.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't help {{hearing what}} Mr Spence {{was saying to}} you about Sheen, sir. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> quite what really happened." ...|$|E
5000|$|Daigo Asahina: The {{protagonist of}} the story, {{he is an}} eighteen-year-old fool who <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{everything}} about firefighting.|$|R
6000|$|A {{thousand}} {{things may}} happen to, [...] Ten thousand things befall, [...] The traveler who careless is, [...] Or <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it all.|$|R
50|$|The {{brain of}} {{inventor}} Jack Brown is {{possessed by the}} soul of a medieval monk who <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> the secret of how to fly.|$|R
6000|$|Marston {{looked and}} started. [...] "It's Peters! This {{is going to}} make things awkward. The brute has lost no time. D'you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> we're here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you think}} that?" [...] Mr. Armstrong said, quickly. [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{a great deal}} better {{what ought to be}} done than I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I don't--but for Manfredi's sake, of course, I do. But for his sake {{more than}} my own, I admit. And I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's possible. But I {{should not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> him. <b>He</b> is just {{telling me the}} news that came to him by way of business. How would <b>he</b> <b>know</b> this Pinkerton man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{as good as}} Yankling Sahib.' The Ao-chung {{man took}} a pull at the whisky-bottle and passed it over. 'Now hear me--unless any other man <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is but {{wood dust}} which I {{use for the}} {{cleaning}} of my nails," [...] cried Masapo, for he was so terrified I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> not what <b>he</b> said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes, for {{a little}} while, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> where he is, {{but most of the}} time he lies {{perfectly}} still, or just talks to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, a great deal; but it's {{more for}} literature," [...] said Pansy--"and for conversation. But papa cares also for those things. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The very thing," [...] {{said the}} senior clerk.--"Run, Tom; give the miller my compliments, and beg the loan of his horse for Charley Kennedy.--I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> you, Charley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Set out upon no such presumption, madame," [...] he interrupted. [...] "I know {{as little}} of a woman's mind as {{any man who}} <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> a deal--and that is nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the other}} side the Baconian, arguing from all that <b>HE</b> <b>knows,</b> or <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows,</b> or can imagine, of the actor's education, {{conditions}} of life, and opportunities, argues that the authorship of the actor is [...] "impossible." ...|$|R
60|$|Let {{the hunting}} lady, however, avoid any touch of this blemish, remembering that no man ever likes {{a woman to}} know as much about a horse as <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "He doesn't know you. And, what is more, I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{much of your}} father. Don't go to him yet." [...] And Herbert {{promised that}} he would not.|$|E
6000|$|Maccario {{turned to}} Appleby. “Our friend walks fast. It is counted a four days’ journey. Still, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that one seldom gains {{anything}} by trifling with the Sin Verguenza.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; but I {{really should}} enjoy showing him the old armour. He was {{asking me about}} it this morning. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> nearly {{as much of it}} as we do.' ...|$|E
60|$|BALSQUITH. Stop. Stop, I say. I dont know. That is the {{difference}} between your job and mine, Mitchener. After twenty years in the army a man <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything. After twenty months in the Cabinet <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the old feller; {{the one in}} {{the cart}} there. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> I was runnin' away, though he didn't say {{anything}} about it; but he looked just as if he did." ...|$|R
60|$|Dor. Peace, old dotard. Mankind, {{that always}} judge of kings with malice, Will <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> this incest, and pursued it. His {{only way to}} rectify mistakes, And to redeem her honour, is to die.|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew is in {{love with}} her himself," [...] Madge said firmly; [...] "though I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it yet. Dick's delightful, but the girl would never be {{satisfied}} with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I can't say. I am told he's very {{reserved}} on the matter. Those {{sellers of}} spirits are great scoundrels generally. I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{more of it}} than anybody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is," [...] went on Noel {{in a hard}} voice. [...] "She has no men friends; her sort never have, only lovers. Why do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> about me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps he didn't {{understand}} your joking, father. He's a foreigner, and shy and proud, and--not like the others. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{what you meant}} then, {{any more than he}} believed he was making a bargain before. He may be poor, but I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> been--a--a--gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're taking Jimmy's road. He was {{the last}} man to come down here, and I wonder what he was {{thinking}} about," [...] he said. [...] "There would have been an ice fringe along the bank, and Jimmy was hungry. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't get through, and it was only because of the woman he held on so tight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seemed no}} worse than usual when I left this morning," [...] said Philip. [...] "It gave me an awful shock when I went in just now. And {{the thought of his}} dying all alone.... D'you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going to die?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> her. She knows him—which is very different. When I ask {{him about}} her he merely tells me she’s fascinating. She is fascinating,” said her ladyship with inimitable dryness.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{young man}} to whom the prince chooses to be kind is, in a way, fortunate," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> more of life than any other person whom I ever met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that. I do {{not imagine}} that he will never be carried astray by high spirits; but I am sure {{that he has the}} strength, honour, and {{sweetness}} that are the elements of greatness!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{will you}} love me?" [...] She {{paused and looked}} down, having even now not {{withdrawn}} her hands from him. But I do not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> how much <b>he</b> had gained. [...] "You used to love me,--a little," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, chimley-pot be it--and that <b>he</b> had {{formerly}} <b>known</b> Mr Lockhart {{but did not}} {{say when}} or where he had first become acquainted with either; yet Trumps's peculiar look and manner when speaking of the lawyer led you to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> more about him than he chose to tell?" ...|$|R
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Oh, {{just what}} he wants to do. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> nothing; and <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything. That points clearly to a {{political}} career. Get him a private secretaryship to someone who can get him an Under Secretaryship; and then leave him alone. He will find his natural and proper place in the end on the Treasury bench.|$|R
