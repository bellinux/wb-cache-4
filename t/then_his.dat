5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, the Kingdom of England formed part of the Angevin empire {{spreading}} across Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, Henry II, who had built up this vast network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the English Channel to the territories of Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou in north-west France, onto Poitou and Gascony in the south-west. For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and <b>then</b> <b>his</b> sons Richard and John, to dominate France.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether John Doukas married once or twice. The name of only one wife, Zoe Doukaina, is known. She was the {{daughter}} of Constantine Doukas and Anna Doukaina, whose exact identity is unclear. If he married twice, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> first marriage took place c. 1150, and his unknown first wife must have died c. 1165. If Zoe Doukaina was indeed his second wife, this marriage took place c. 1170.|$|E

5|$|On 16 July 2013, Baroš agreed {{a one-year}} {{contract}} with Turkish club Antalyaspor.

He scored his first goal for Antalyaspor against Bursaspor in August, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> second against Rizespor in October. He suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in December 2013, ruling him out of action {{for the rest of}} the season.

5|$|On January 22, 1836, {{the island}} was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout at an annual cost of 196 francs. Still, another treaty made Sédhiou the primary trading post of Casamance, and the {{exploitation}} of Carabane was left for {{some time in the}} hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre <b>then</b> <b>his</b> brother Jean. Each successively took on the title of Resident. With this official but ambiguous title, they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France.|$|E
5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E
25|$|The Hasmonean Kingdom {{lasted for}} 103 years. It was ruled by Simon Maccabaeus, {{the son of}} Matityahu; <b>then</b> by <b>his</b> son Yochanan, known as John Hyrcanus, who started minting his own Hasmonean coins; <b>then</b> by <b>his</b> son Yehuda Aristobulus; <b>then</b> by <b>his</b> wife Salome Alexandra; <b>then</b> by <b>his</b> brother Alexander Yannai; <b>then</b> by <b>his</b> sons Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. When the {{brothers}} Hyrcanus and Aristobulus each asked for Rome to intervene on their behalf, Judea fell under the greater rule of Rome as an autonomous province but still with {{a significant amount of}} independence. The last Hasmonean king was Aristobulus' son Antigonus II Matityahu.|$|R

5|$|Tracy left Ripon, {{and began}} classes at AADA in April 1922. He was deemed fit to {{progress}} {{to the senior}} class, allowing him to join the academy stock company. Tracy made his New York debut in October 1922, in a play called The Wedding Guests, and <b>then</b> <b>his</b> Broadway debut three months later playing a wordless robot in R.U.R. He graduated from AADA in March 1923.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to make {{an unusual}} romance film, Anand {{struggled}} to find unconventional ideas while he was writing. <b>Then</b> <b>his</b> wife Mamta {{came up with the}} core narrative of the film, which excited him and changed his perspective. Anand approached novelist Advaita Kala who developed the story into a feature-length script, and later co-wrote the screenplay with him. Principal photography was done entirely in New York City, Las Vegas and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty had {{traditionally}} {{worked in}} the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, {{and closer to the}} style of Titian. This is likely owing {{to the nature of the}} subject matter. Until <b>then</b> <b>his</b> history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology, and took place in brightly lit Mediterranean settings. The Seasons, by contrast, was seen as an explicitly English work, requiring a more muted palette to deal with the typical lighting conditions of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.|$|E

5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since <b>then,</b> <b>his</b> father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E
5|$|Following Houston's loss to Utah, McGrady {{underwent}} {{arthroscopic surgery}} on both {{his left shoulder}} and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} year. By <b>then,</b> <b>his</b> averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.|$|E

5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If {{he or she was}} from ZANLA, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of William de Lovetot, the manor of Hallamshire passed to his son Richard de Lovetot and <b>then</b> <b>his</b> son William de Lovetot before being passed by {{marriage}} to Gerard de Furnival in about 1204. The de Furnivals held the manor for the next 180 years. The fourth Furnival lord, Thomas de Furnival, supported Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War. As a result of this, in 1266 a party of barons, led by John de Eyvill, marching from north Lincolnshire to Derbyshire passed through Sheffield and destroyed the town, burning the church and castle.|$|E
5|$|From about 1498, {{power in}} Moldavia quietly shifted toward {{a group of}} boyars and administrators, comprising, among others, Luca Arbore and Ioan Tăutu. Stephen's son and co-ruler, Bogdan, was also taking on princely {{responsibilities}} from his father. He conducted the negotiations with Poland about a peace treaty. The treaty, which Stephen ratified at Hârlău in 1499, {{put an end to}} Polish suzerainty over Moldavia. Stephen again stopped paying tribute to the Ottomans in 1500, although by <b>then</b> <b>his</b> health had declined. In February 1501, his delegation arrived in Venice, asking for a specialist doctor. As reported by Marin Sanudo, his envoys also discussed the possibility of Moldavia and Hungary joining the Ottoman–Venetian War.
