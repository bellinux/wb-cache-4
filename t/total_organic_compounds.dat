40|$|Thesis (MMed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Indoor {{air quality}} {{has become an}} {{important}} health concern due {{to the number of}} indoor pollutants and the realization that even minimal exposures to volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> may produce direct or indirect adverse health outcomes. Young people are most vulnerable to these poisonous chemicals as they spend much of their times indoors at homes, schools, nurseries and in day care centers. Exposure to volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> indoors has been related to asthma and other respiratory symptoms. The adverse effects of air pollution on respiratory health in South Durban have been described in a number of studies. In 2000, a study in the South Durban Basin at Settlers Primary School demonstrated both a high prevalence of respiratory diseases amongst schoolchildren as well as an association between ambient air pollutants and other adverse health outcomes. The South Durban Health Study subsequently undertook a health risk assessment and an epidemiological study investigating this association further on behalf of the eThekwini Municipality. The study highlighted that relatively moderate ambient concentration of N 02, NO, PMIO and S 02 were strongly and significantly associated with a reduction in lung function among children with persistent asthma. Moreover, attending primary school in South Durban was significantly associated with increased risk from persistent asthma when compared to schools in North Durban. METHODS The descriptive study measured the <b>total</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> levels within selected homes and schools of asthmatic children in South and North Durban. Recommendations for reducing or mitigating indoor <b>total</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> exposures were made. The study involved a secondary analysis of data obtained from the South Durban Health Study. The monitoring for <b>total</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> within homes and classrooms was undertaken using passive samplers during a 72 -hour period and analyzed using a gaschromatography/ mass spectrometry method. Temperature and humidity was assessed using temperature and humidity sensors. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 13. The dataset comprised 140 <b>total</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compound</b> samples from homes and 14 from classrooms. <b>Total</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> were measured in microgram per cubic meter (g/m 3), temperature in degrees Celsius and relative humidity in percentage of moisture. RESULTS <b>Total</b> volatile <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> with levels in households ranging from 17 g/m 3 to 1440 g/m 3 and in classrooms ranging from 48 g/m 3 to 5292 g/m 3 were measured.

An increasing indoor air humidity can be a possible consequence of insufficient air exchange rates, which may lead to an increased risk of mold growth.

These emission parameters {{could be used to}} estimate real indoor TVOC concentrations...|$|R
