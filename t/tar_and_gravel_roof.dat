50|$|Clark and Sorrell Garage is a {{historic}} automobile repair shop located at Durham, Durham County, North Carolina. It was built in 1932, and is a one-story brick building, three bays wide and four bays deep, with a flat <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>roof.</b> It was expanded about 1941 with a seven bay, brick-faced addition. The addition features an Art Moderne style entrance with a stuccoed surround. Attached to the garage is a two-story office building. It is the oldest auto repair garage still in operation in the city.|$|E
50|$|The David and Mary Margaret Durst House is a {{historic}} house at 857 Fairview Drive in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a post-and-beam structure, long and narrow, which is in places cantilevered over a concrete foundation poured in board forms that left vertical marks in the concrete. The building has a flat <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>roof,</b> unusual {{at the time of}} its construction for residential architecture. The house was the first major design of architect John G. Williams, made in collaboration with his clients, David and Mary Durst. David Durst was at the time chairman of the art department at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, and Williams was the head of its Architecture Department.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, there were two schoolhouses {{recorded}} as being present in the area on maps of the township; there are no records of these schools, so little details are known of how they operated. In the same century, the township of Augusta was divided into school sections each of which had its own schoolhouse to serve the section. North Augusta was labelled school section seventeen, and in 1915 a school aptly titled S.S. #17 North Augusta School was built. The school was a two-storey building with a basement, {{much larger than the}} other schoolhouses operating here at the time. It was a concrete block building with a built-up <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>roof</b> and a brick chimney constructed from the foundation; the floors were made of hardwood and the hallways and ceilings were plaster. The school had a total of four classrooms, two on each floor with a chemistry lab located on the second floor. The school was heated by a coal-fed furnace and water needed to be transported from a separate dwelling.|$|E
50|$|The state {{portion of}} the parkway {{received}} asphalt {{for the first time}} in 2004 (all of the parkway was originally paved with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Repairs for asphalt <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>roofs</b> can be problematic, {{largely because}} it is {{difficult}} to locate the exact point of a leak. Newer systems can be patched relatively easily because breaks and leaks are easier to locate.|$|R
50|$|It has {{brick walls}} and a wood roof & floors system, and a flat roof made of {{built-up}} <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> It has a Mission Revival-style parapet with vigas extending. It has a three-bay one-story porch.|$|R
50|$|A {{flat roof}} lasts longer {{if it is}} {{properly}} maintained. Some assessors use 10 years as an average life cycle, although this {{is dependent on the}} type of flat roof system in place. Some old <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> roofers acknowledge that unless a roof has been neglected for too long and there are many problems in many areas, a BUR (a built up <b>roof</b> of <b>tar,</b> paper <b>and</b> <b>gravel)</b> will last 20-30 years. There are BUR systems in place dating to the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|The {{houses at}} Airport Villa were {{constructed}} of cinder blocks and had <b>roofs</b> of <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> Each home had a carport, patio, substantial sized yard and high {{windows on the}} front.

5000|$|A {{copper-clad}} {{hipped roof}} {{rises from the}} center of the original building over the projecting pavilion. Originally, the roof had a wood [...] "widow's walk" [...] atop it. The widow's walk was encased in aluminum siding, though the original wood structure remains in place. The remainder of the roof of the original (1936) building and the 1964 wing is built-up <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{overall design}} {{of the house is}} straightforward: glass, redwood and pine lumber, transits with some {{aluminum}} and brass flashing. The roofs are flat; built-up with paper, <b>tar,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> in some cases, on the terraces, the addition of pine duck boards. The main house is a 24 by 45 ft rectangle. The first floor has a one-story living room and screened porch extended from the two-story portion. The rest of the main floor includes a kitchen, bathroom and small study or guest room. The second floor has a bathroom, a large bedroom and a second bedroom/studio.|$|R
50|$|It is a 2-story, Mediterranean Revival style {{house with}} an {{irregular}} floor plan 3-story square tower at one corner. The exterior walls have a stuccoed finish {{resting on a}} concrete slab foundation, and is covered by cross-gable, hip, shed, and flat <b>roof</b> components. <b>Tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> {{is used for the}} flat roof; asphalt shingles cover the remaining roofed surfaces. The house is constructed of wood frame, covered with stucco.|$|R
50|$|A single {{detached}} structure, {{the building}} is an irregular polygon in plan, measuring 10' x 81' x 52' x 42' x 61'. It is two full stories with a full basement. The main entrance is on the southeast corner with a second major entrance centered on the east facade. The building is Italianate in style and is constructed of red brick in the stretcher bond pattern. The foundation is also brick. The roof is flat <b>and</b> covered with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|All {{the wood}} on the {{exterior}} was originally tidewater red cypress. The brick is a [...] "tan" [...] colonial that varies in color from tan to a reddish-brown and was laid with a recessed header row. The original roof was a level <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> construction designed to hold 2 inches of water to help with summer cooling. Two small raised pools are located {{at the south end}} of the living room and on the east side of the dining room.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{commercial}} building with structural brick walls and with wood floor and roof systems. Its <b>roof</b> is built-up <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> It has a raised brick parapet and a denticulated brick cornice. Its east portion is a one-story {{and the rest}} is two-story. Its second story was used by the local Knights of Columbus as their meeting hall, and the first floor was for businesses. The one-story portion of the building was the Victoria Hardware Company for many years, then auto supply stores.|$|R
50|$|The Robert and Suzanne Drucker House {{is in the}} Indian Hills Subdivision of Wilmette. It is on {{the south}} side of Iroquois Street halfway between Illinois Road to the east and Hibbard Road to the west. The house stands out on its block, which is {{otherwise}} filled with standard historical revival homes. It is situated on a deep rectangular 0.5 acre lot with a fenced rear yard. The house sits 85 ft back from Iroquois Street. The two-story house is generally L-shaped with its long portion parallel to Iroquois and its wing extension on the west. Typical of the International Style, the house lacks excess ornamentation. Roofs are flat, covered with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> edged with aluminum. Exterior walls are painted vertical board-and-batten cedar siting. Doors and windows have painted metal frames. The carport, porches, and terrace have wood privacy walls.|$|R
2500|$|In 1921 a {{monument}} to the [...] "Mothers of the Revolution" [...] was placed at the southern end. Homes and farms along the road were electrified in 1935 due to the efforts of the newly created Rural Electrification Administration, adding utility poles to the landscape. A portion of the road near Travis Corners was surfaced in <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> in the 20th century. Beyond that, it remains {{as it was in the}} mid-18th century. Following its NRHP listing, a group called the Old Road Society of Philipstown (ORSP) was formed to help preserve and promote it. Its membership is open to residents along the road and intersecting dirt roads.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the township roads are either <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> chip or <b>gravel.</b> These roads are well maintained by the township and provide travel for all township residents.|$|R
50|$|Asphalt BUR {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} layers of reinforcing plies and asphalt forming a redundancy of waterproofing layers. The reflectivity of built up roofs depends on the surfacing material used. Gravel is the most common and they are referred to as asphalt <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>roofs.</b> Asphalt degradation is a growing concern. UV-rays oxidize the surface of the asphalt and produce a chalk-like residue. As plasticizers leach out of the asphalt, asphalt built-up roofs become brittle. Cracking and alligatoring inevitably follows, allowing water to penetrate the system causing blisters, cracks and leaks. Compared to other systems, installation of asphalt roofs is energy-intensive (hot processes typically use LP gas as the heat source), and contributes to atmospheric air pollution (toxic, and green-house gases are lost from the asphalt during installation).|$|R
5000|$|The {{roof was}} flat, covered in <b>tar</b> paper <b>and</b> <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> emitted radiant heat {{into the top}} floor {{whenever}} the sun shone. The outer sheathing consisted of asbestos-cement shingles painted a dirty white in a vain attempt to reduce solar heat load. The windows were leaky, rattling wooden sash, and bristled with numerous large window-mounted air conditioners, since the interior spaces would otherwise become unbearably hot during warm weather.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{was learned}} from Elands' {{performance}} in Operation Savannah. Their {{ability to move}} so swiftly over <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> packed <b>gravel</b> surprised FAPLA on multiple occasions. [...] They were also rather silent; a quiet petrol engine enabled stealth during ambush or evasive manoeuvres. Furthermore, the Eland-90 proved that it was powerful enough to defeat the heaviest armour ranged against it, the Soviet T-34. Savannah was the SAAC's first experience of mobile warfare in the Angolan bush, creating a laboratory where new tactics could be tested.|$|R
50|$|Building {{papers and}} {{membranes}} {{are used for}} many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is red rosin paper which {{was known to be}} in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. Tar paper was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper <b>and</b> for <b>gravel</b> <b>roofs.</b> <b>Tar</b> paper has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt felt paper. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by housewraps.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally most flat roofs in {{the western}} world make use of tar or asphalt more usually felt paper applied over roof decking to keep a {{building}} watertight. The felt paper is in turn covered with a flood coat of bitumen (asphalt or <b>tar)</b> <b>and</b> then <b>gravel</b> to keep the sun's heat, UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation. Roof decking is usually of plywood, chipboard or OSB boards (OSB = Oriented Strand Board, also known as Sterling board) of around 18mm thickness, steel or concrete. The mopping of bitumen is applied in two or more coats (usually 3 or 4) as a hot liquid, heated in a kettle. A flooded coat of bitumen is applied over the felts <b>and</b> <b>gravel</b> is embedded in the hot bitumen.|$|R
50|$|Following the 1871-1872 {{expansion}} {{there were}} several improvements to the fort. In 1873-1874 the 6 adobe barracks from the 1867-1868 expansion were rehabilitated in order to stabilize their crumbling adobe, this was done by adding wood sheathing {{to the outside of}} the building protecting it from the weather as well as plastering the interior and replacing the sod roof with a new lighter <b>roof</b> covered with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> At the same time, the kitchen and mess hall for each barracks was relocated from the main building to a new addition connected by a short hallway. This new addition was built using the same quality lumber from the Eastern States as used in the other buildings of the 1871-1872 expansion, the existing reconstruction represents what the original building would have looked like in 1876. By 1880 however, all of the remaining adobe barracks buildings were collapsing, with a few having already collapsed and forcing the men to bivouac in tents on the parade ground. By 1881, the adobe structures were torn down and replaced with wooden structures relocated to {{the eastern side of the}} parade ground. In 1883, the Commanding Officer's Quarters' bay window was pushed out to the South adding on two rooms to the structure.|$|R
50|$|On 1894, {{he settled}} in Monaco {{where he met}} Prince Albert I who asked him {{what could be done}} to ban the dust stirred up by the first motor vehicles. He applied an idea found in Indonesian {{hospitals}} where wooden floors were coated with tar: he developed a new mixture of <b>tar,</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> sand for binding the dust.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} a {{hemicycle}} design, measuring approximately 2600 sq ft on a 1.3 acre lot. The Laurent House was Wright's first single-story building to use this design. The lot gently slopes toward the Spring Creek. It is primarily built with red tidewater cypress and Chicago common brick; plans originally called for limestone, but the Laurents rejected the additional cost. It is built on a poured concrete foundation set on crushed rock; {{the top layer of}} concrete was mixed with a red pigment. The house features two large chimneys. The central chimney is above the roofline with a wide copper drip edge. The other chimney is on the end wall of {{the east side of the}} master bedroom. The roof is flat and is made of <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> The house has deep eaves and a wide fascia. Recessed square lightboxes are found intermittently along the eaves. All windows have cypress frames and are single light. The main entrance is underneath a two-car carport. A 50 ft curved wall of glass faces the northwest. The house has radiant heat from water pipes. The only sub-grade area of the {{house is a}} small maintenance room where devices such as the water heater and water softener are located. Bathrooms are larger than in most Wright designs for improved maneuverability.|$|R
40|$|During May and June 1994, 45 pitfall traps {{were exposed}} in {{three types of}} small, urban habitats: traffic islands, flat <b>gravel</b> <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> courtyards ranging from 65 to 1. 800 m 2. The three habitat types differ in their {{exposure}} to sun and wind creating microclimatic conditions similar {{to a variety of}} natural habitats, i. e. grassland, rocky outcrops and forests. In total, 2. 163 spiders (147 juveniles) were caught, belonging to 61 species in 16 families. A cluster analysis showed distinctively different spider assemblages for the three habitat types. Traffic islands are inhabited by a typical openland community. Dominating species are Alopecosa pulverulenta, Pardosa pullata <b>and</b> Pachygnatha degeeri. <b>Gravel</b> <b>roofs</b> show high numbers of salticids, in particular Euophrys lanigera.

50|$|The Wichita City Carnegie Library Building {{located at}} 220 S. Main Street in Wichita, Kansas, Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States, is a Carnegie library built in 1915. It was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The two-story, {{limestone}} Beaux Arts building stands in the southwestern part of Wichita's central business district, directly south of the old City Hall. Its façade orientation is west. The building measures approximately one hundred and twenty-eight feet {{from north to south}} and eighty-three feet from east to west. After the completion of Wichita's present library in 1966, the Wichita City Carnegie Library Building served as city offices and the municipal court until the Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center established its tenancy in 1976, followed by changing tenants.The two-story, ashlar cut, limestone block building sits on an ashlar cut, limestone block, raised foundation with a multiply moulded watertable. Three bays comprise the rectangular building's façade and rear. The building's main body is one bay deep, a one-bay-by-one-bay brick unit extends from the rear elevation's center bay. A parapetted entry pavilion projects from the facade's center bay. A short, square tower rises from the building's central bay, covered by a rounded, truncated hipped roof sheathed with pantiles and surmounted by a monitor roof. Tripartite windows with translucent glass pierce each wall of the central tower. Standing seam metal covers the gable roofs of the two main wings, the metal may have been tarred. Two skylights, which have been covered due to water leakage, pierce the gable roofs midway. The entry pavilion and the rear extension have low roofs hidden by parapets, they are likely covered with <b>tar</b> <b>and</b> <b>gravel.</b> The building retains its original metal drain pipes on the outer edges of the façade and the rear extension.|$|R
40|$|Green roofs on {{buildings}} are becoming popular and represent a new {{component of the}} urban landscape. Public benefits of green roof projects include reduced stormwater runoff, improved air quality, reduced urban heat island effects, and aesthetic values. As part of a city-wide plan, several green roofs have been constructed at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport (ORD). Like some other landscaping features, green roofs on or near an airport might attract wildlife and thus {{increase the risk of}} bird–aircraft collisions. During 2007 – 2011, we conducted a series of studies to evaluate wildlife use of newly constructed green <b>roofs</b> <b>and</b> traditional (<b>gravel)</b> <b>roofs</b> on buildings at ORD. These green roofs were 0. 04 – 1. 62 ha in area and consisted of primarily stone crop species for vegetation. A total of 188 birds were observed using roofs during this research. Of the birds using green roofs, 66, 23, and 4 % were Killdeer, European Starlings, and Mourning Doves, respectively. Killdeer nested on green roofs, whereas the other species perched, foraged, or loafed. Birds used green roofs almost exclusively between May and October. Overall, avian use of the green roofs was minimal and similar to that of buildings with traditional roofs. Although green roofs with other vegetation types might offer forage or cover to birds and thus attract potentially hazardous wildlife, the stonecrop-vegetated green roofs in this study did not increase the risk of bird–aircraft collisions...|$|R
40|$|Recent safety {{analyses}} at nuclear explosive {{facilities have}} {{renewed interest in}} the accident phenomenology associated with explosions in nuclear explosive cells, which are {{commonly referred to as}} {open_quotes}Gravel Gerties. {close_quotes} The cells are used for the assembly and disassembly of nuclear explosives and are located in the Device Assembly Facility (DAF) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and at the Pantex facility. The cells are designed to mitigate the release of special nuclear material to the environment {{in the event of a}} detonation of high explosive within the Gravel Gertie. Although there are some subtle differences between the cells of DAF and Pantex, their general design, geometry, and configuration are similar. The cells consist of a round room approximately 10. 4 m in diameter and 5. 2 m high enclosed by 0. 3 -m-thick concrete. Each cell has a wire-rope cantenary <b>roof</b> overlain with <b>gravel.</b> The gravel is approximately 6. 9 m deep at the center of the roof and decreases toward the outer edge of the cell. The cell is connected to a corridor and subsequent rooms through an interlocking blast door. In the event of a accidental explosion involving significant amounts of high explosive, the roof structure is lifted by the force of the explosion, the supporting cables break, the gravel is lifted by the blast (resulting in rapid venting of the cell), <b>and</b> the <b>gravel</b> <b>roof</b> collapses, filling the cell.
