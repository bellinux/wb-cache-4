5|$|Coming {{into the}} match, the Kerala Blasters {{made a couple}} {{necessary}} defensive changes from the squad <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> Chennaiyin in the semi-finals. David James replaced the injured Sandip Nandy in goal, while Saumik Dey and Nirmal Chettri replaced the suspended pair of Jamie McAllister and Gurwinder Singh {{in the middle of}} defense. Atlético de Kolkata head coach, Antonio Lopez Habas, meanwhile decided to bench the team's marquee player, Luis García, and instead started Arnal in central midfield. Habas also decided to switch to playing four defenders instead of three, which meant that Kingshuk Debnath started the match while Lester Fernandez moved to the bench.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} had two main entrances: a main entrance {{at ground level}} <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> east onto Queen's Park Drive, and a connecting passageway from the Royal Ontario Museum from {{what used to be}} the Mineralogy Gallery. On the wall opposite from the ticket booth and coat check was an evocative quote from Dante Alighieri Divine Comedy. Admission to either facility allowed visitors to see exhibits in both buildings, though a planetarium show cost extra.|$|E
5|$|The first British Isles side (now {{known as}} the British and Irish Lions) toured New Zealand and Australia in 1888. The side was privately organised, without the {{sanction}} or prohibition of England's Rugby Football Union, and toured New Zealand in April and May that year where they played against a number of provincial sides. Although the team was not representative of the best British and Irish players, it did include three internationals with the rest predominantly county representatives. Warbrick was in the Wellington team <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the tourists on 13 May. The match was ill-tempered, with each side accusing the other of rough play, and eventually finished as a 3–3 draw.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit that}} {{develops}} is a schizocarp {{consisting of two}} mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.|$|E
5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, Maxwell, and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maxwell {{and the other three}} justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and because they could be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, the major issues <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> Maxwell and the justices primarily involved post-war reconstruction and sectional acrimonies across the state. He served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court from January 1, 1867 until December 31, 1872.|$|E
5|$|Warbrick only played {{twice more}} in the {{following}} month, and was not fit enough to be selected for the team <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> England on 16 February. The match resulted in a controversial 7–0 loss for the Natives, and included the awarding of two dubious English tries by the referee George Rowland Hill – who was also Secretary of the English Rugby Football Union (RFU). The loss and aftermath soured the relationship between Warbrick's team and the RFU – who accused the Natives of poor sportsmanship after they had protested at the awarding of the controversial tries.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, as {{a result}} of both {{production}} peaks in some nations and political instability in others, the world's supply of petroleum tightened leading to an energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the first}} Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial {{challenge}} trophy won by defeating the holder, {{was to become}} the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Gallaher in the side, were upset 6–3 by the Wellingtonians. Gallaher was then selected for the New Zealand team <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the touring British Isles in what was New Zealand's first Test match on home soil. The British team were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand, and had finished their Australian leg unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Insight Bowl {{contracted}} with the Big East conference and Pacific-10 conference to select teams {{for participation in}} its annual game. Big East champion Miami was awarded an automatic Bowl Championship Series berth, and second-place Pittsburgh accepted a bid to the Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Continental Tire Bowl officials considered inviting Virginia Tech {{to participate in the}} game, but were required to invite Virginia due to the Continental Tire Bowl's contract with the Atlantic Coast Conference. Rather than selecting two teams <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> each other in the final game of the regular season, Continental Bowl officials chose another team. The other possibility for the Hokies was the San Francisco Bowl, whose managers also held a contract with the Big East, but because Tech played in the previous year's San Francisco Bowl, the bowl's organizing committee decided against a second invitation.|$|E

5|$|In early-1941 Stalin {{authorized}} the State Defense Plan 1941 (DP-41), which {{along with the}} Mobilization Plan 1941 (MP-41), called for the deployment of 186 divisions, as the first strategic echelon, in the four military districts of the western Soviet Union <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the Axis territories; and the deployment of another 51 divisions along the Dvina and Dnieper Rivers as the second strategic echelon under Stavka control, which {{in the case of}} a German invasion was tasked to spearhead a Soviet counteroffensive along with the remaining forces of the first echelon. But on 22 June 1941 the first echelon only contained 171 divisions, numbering 2.6–2.9 million; and the second strategic echelon contained 57 divisions that were still mobilizing, most of which were still understrength. The second echelon was undetected by German intelligence until days after the invasion commenced, in most cases only when German ground forces bumped into them.|$|E
5|$|Like {{much of the}} country, and {{particularly}} Texas, Galveston boomed in the 1920s. But even the Great Depression did not stop Galveston's run of prosperity. Despite the financial ruin <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> {{much of the country}} during the Depression, not a single Galveston bank failed and unemployment was almost unheard of. Key business sectors in Galveston during the Free State era were casinos and prostitution, in addition to many legitimate businesses. During much of the period, the vice industries provided the majority of employment. Two families held particular prominence on the island during this era: the Moodys controlled the largest legitimate interests, and the Maceos controlled the largest criminal enterprises. Both families were wealthy with business empires that extended beyond the island.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Camerinum in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, {{all of whom were}} probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the Romans at the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians. When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy and in the Battle of Populonia (282 BC) Rome destroyed the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.|$|E

5|$|Structure 5D-87 is {{also known}} as the Temple of the Skulls (Templo de las Calaveras in Spanish). It is the third largest temple in the Mundo Perdido complex. A new version of this temple was {{superimposed}} upon a preceding version during the 7th century AD. This new version faced away from the Mundo Perdido and possessed a single room with five doorways <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> onto the adjacent Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. Around AD 700, this version was sealed and a new version was built on top, at which time it became one of the highest structures in the Mundo Perdido. This version of the structure had a four-level platform with an access stairway interrupted by a vaulted niche, as was the architectural style prevalent at Tikal during this time. The base of the niche was adorned with three sculpted skulls, one facing forwards and the two flanking skulls in profile.|$|E
5|$|The Vine Street Police Station was at No.10. It was {{originally}} {{built as a}} watch-house around 1767, and rebuilt following a fire in 1786 that destroyed several properties on and around the street. A school operated on the first floor, and two cells were in the basement. A further storey {{was added to the}} building in 1816. It was renamed Vine Street Police Station in 1829 following the establishment of the Metropolitan Police District. The school moved from the building to Swallow Street in 1836, where it stayed before closing in 1881. The police station went on {{to become one of the}} main stations in Central London. In 1850, it was extended over the 18th century courthouses. At one point in the 19th century it was one of the busiest police stations in the world. An Arts and Crafts extension wing was built on the station in 1897, <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> onto Swallow Street. The Man in the Moon pub, adjacent to the station, was bought by the police receiver in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the desert to the west. The builders in the second phase also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the Rodrigues parrot had similarities with the Tanygnathus and Psittacula parrot genera. The pectoral and pelvic bones {{were similar in}} size {{to those of the}} New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), and it may have looked similar to the great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos) in life, but with a larger head and tail. It differed from other Mascarene parrots in several skeletal features, including having nostrils <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> upwards instead of forwards. No features of the skull suggest it had a crest like the broad-billed parrot, and there is not enough fossil evidence to determine whether it had pronounced sexual dimorphism. There are intermediate specimens between the longest and shortest examples of the known skeletal elements, which indicates there were no distinct size groups.|$|E
5|$|After the Fort Worth tornado dissipated, another {{thunderstorm}} {{developed over}} Johnson County, tracking northeastward into Tarrant County and eventually merging with the supercell that had produced the earlier F3tornado. The new development prompted the re-issuance of the tornado warning for Tarrant County at 6:40p.m. CST (00:40UTC). At 7:05p.m. CST (01:05UTC), the Arlington tornado touched down on South Cooper Road, causing initial {{damage to a}} restaurant; the tornado's touchdown coincided {{with the appearance of}} a tornado vortex signature on radar imagery. Well-built homes within a residential area along Embercrest Drive sustained widespread damage, with some houses experiencing up to F3-rated damage; such damage occurred after garage doors failed, allowing tornadic winds to unroof homes and push out exterior walls. As a consequence, homes <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> the tornadic winds sustained more damage than homes whose attached garages were sheltered from the strong winds. After crossing Matlock Road, the tornado did additional damage to one- and two-story homes in another subdivision, producing F3damage. Many homes suffered the collapse of brick masonry walls due to poor construction as they were not properly anchored to the homes' frames. The tornado then swept across northern portions of the Arlington Municipal Airport, dealing F2damage before briefly paralleling Interstate 20. At 7:12p.m. CST (01:12UTC), the tornado crossed the interstate, overturning at least one 18-wheeler. The twister continued to track northeast, causing F2damage to a subdivision northeast of Grand Prairie Municipal Airport in Dallas County before dissipating at 7:20p.m. CST (01:20UTC).|$|E
5|$|During the 7th century {{there were}} {{significant}} changes to the East Platform, including {{a new version of}} Temple 5D-87 <b>that</b> <b>faced</b> away from the Mundo Perdido. Around AD 700 this version was sealed and another version built on top, making Temple 5D-87 one of the three highest structures in the Mundo Perdido. This new version created a new orienting axis in the complex, breaking the primary axis associated with the ancient E-Group complex and its relationship with the old solar cult, thus marking a major change in the ceremonial use of the Mundo Perdido complex. It is about this same time that the twin pyramid complex came into use, demonstrating a major internal reorganisation of the city. During the Late Classic, access to the complex was gradually restricted by closing various access points with new structures, this included discontinuing the use of the causeway that had linked the complex with the North Acropolis since the Preclassic. A new palace complex was built in the northern section of the Mundo Perdido, developing during the 7th and 8th centuries AD; This marked an important change {{in the use of the}} Mundo Perdido, which until then had been dedicated to purely ritual activities. The construction of the palace indicates the permanent inhabitation of the complex by an elite group, apparently involved in some way with the administration of the city.|$|E
