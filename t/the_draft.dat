5|$|The 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 2–14 season. This {{was one of the}} worst seasons in {{franchise}} history.

The Buccaneers selected Bo Jackson with the top pick in <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> but were unable to convince him to join the team. Three weeks after <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals. Despite holding four of the first forty selections in <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> and the presence of a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find any impact players in either <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> or free agency.
