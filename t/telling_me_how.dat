500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2012–13 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that [...] "I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes {{are going to be}} made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's pretty good at <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> this club should be run. Well I'm going to tell him that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. If we lose a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams down there with us, which quite frankly is not good enough." [...] Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town.|$|E
500|$|Although Anbe Vaa {{is based}} on Come September, The Times of India stated that it was [...] "structured as a Roman Holiday with a man as the protagonist". Folklorist and writer M. D. Muthukumaraswamy, writing for The Times of India, {{compared}} M. G. Ramachandran's character in the film to the sage Vishvamitra, describing the former as [...] "the archetypal male figure who resists the advances of the beautiful damsels", similar to Vishvamitra resisting the temptations of the Apsara Menaka. Sujatha Narayan, writing for The New Indian Express, noted that Anbe Vaa, like other films starring Ramachandran, reflected his personal belief of not being arrogant towards women, stating, [...] "I recall one of my uncles <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> MGR would never chase the heroine on screen, never display interest in her first, and how the heroine will always pine for him, even in an out-and-out romantic story like Anbe Vaa." [...] According to Sri Lankan historian and author Sachi Sri Kantha, the song [...] "Pudhiya Vaanam" [...] had [...] "delicately introduced" [...] the symbol for the political party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) through the lyrics, [...] "Udaya sooriyanin paarvaiyile– ulagam vizhithukonda velaiyile, imayathil irukkum kulir kaatru Ithayathai thodukirathu" [...] ("While rising sun shines, the world will become aware, the cool wind from Himalaya will touch the heart") in that pre-election year. Film historian Randor Guy of The Hindu concurred that the black and red shirt Ramachandran sports in that song [...] "had a political touch." [...] This referred to the colours of the DMK flag.|$|E

2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{covers for}} the third volume of The Invisibles were [...] "done on the computer," [...] in part because [...] "Vertigo were paying for [...] "painted" [...] covers and [...] felt [...] had to deliver {{something}} more than line and flat color." [...] The experimental nature of the twelve covers was assisted by the fact that, says Bolland [...] "neither I nor Shelly had seen that issue's script." [...] For the trade paperback covers, Bolland [...] "was determined to make each one weirder than the last," [...] and so created a Francis Bacon inspired [...] "fleshy mass [...] with a typewriter" [...] for Entropy in the UK. Having convinced Karen Berger (Editor in chief of Vertigo) and Shelly Roeberg {{that it was a}} good idea, the artist recalls that [...] "Shelly rang up and, rather than <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> wonderful I was, said that when she saw it she nearly lost her lunch! I was asked to turn his skin color from flesh to blue to tone him down a bit." [...] For the final Invisible Kingdom TPB cover, Bolland produced [...] "a cover containing 12 small alternative Invisibles covers," [...] which [...] "took a long time to do." [...] Likening the process to creating [...] "a mini comic strip," [...] Bolland says that [...] "if any detail made any sense it had to be changed to something that didn't." ...|$|E
