5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Columbia River system.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia started in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> {{the field in}} the moguls; Nicholas Cleaver and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into {{the lower half of the}} rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E
5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{later became}} a vestryman for Copole Parish and Justice of the Peace in Westmoreland County. In 1723, Lee {{became a member of}} the House of Burgesses. He held this office until he was {{appointed}} to the Governor's Council in the Virginia General Assembly in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor. Members of the Council were advisers to the governor and judges in the General Court of the colony. Their work led them to spend about a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.|$|E

5|$|The Panthers {{struggled}} {{during their}} early years and only once {{during their first}} four seasons did they finish in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the league table. The club's first coach, Alex Archer, left Nottingham after two seasons {{and was replaced by}} Archie Stinchcombe who would coach the team until 1955. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including forwards Les Strongman and Chick Zamick. Zamick {{became one of the most}} prolific scorers in the league and won the Nottingham Sportsman of the Year award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the Notts County and England international footballer Tommy Lawton.|$|E
5|$|Watford's weak {{financial}} position was exposed in 2002–03, following {{the collapse of}} ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw {{a large number of}} players released that summer. After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford's league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005. His successor, Aidy Boothroyd, led the club to Championship survival.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day after next, Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E

5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} decade, Malmö FF established {{themselves as a}} permanent fixture in Allsvenskan. The side had a period of great success in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when they finished within the top three in Allsvenskan for ten years in a row, securing five league titles. The club also won the main Swedish cup tournament, Svenska Cupen (established in 1941), five times during the same period. The club continued to finish in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the league table and experienced additional periods of success during the late 1960s and the 1970s. Malmö FF also qualified for European competition arranged by The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), doing so {{for the first time}} during the 1964–65 season when they entered the European Cup (qualifying as Allsvenskan leaders during the European summer, as Sweden had switched to a season format based around the calendar year). The club qualified for continental competitions 12 times in a row between 1971 and 1982.|$|E
