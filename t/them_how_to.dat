5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of building a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> assemble special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks. From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven space shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble, outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the station.|$|E

He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E

5|$|In late 1999, a {{group of}} men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license.

5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was {{to abstain from}} all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair.

In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> raise the boy {{who was going to be}} born.|$|E

The long-term future of the Valois dynasty, which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.|$|E

After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion.

5|$|In {{training}} his men, al-Qassam {{stressed that}} maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should {{provide for the}} needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties {{with their families and}} pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa's labor slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E

5|$|Firestar's Quest, {{the first}} Warriors Super Edition, was {{released}} on 25 August 2007. It is set between The Darkest Hour and Midnight and details Firestar and his mate Sandstorm's journey to restore SkyClan, the fifth Clan of the forest that is driven out when a town is built and scattered when it is attacked by rats in its new home. Firestar and Sandstorm find rogues and house cats, {{some of whom are}} descendants of the former SkyClan and teach <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hunt, fight, and follow the warrior code. When a house cat named Echo dreams of starry cats, Firestar realizes that the dream was sent by StarClan, indicating that Echo should be SkyClan's medicine cat. Echo is taught all that Sandstorm was taught before leaving ThunderClan with Firestar on their quest. She is named Echosong. While SkyClan is rebuilding its ranks, rats attack as they did when SkyClan first came to the gorge. SkyClan defeats them by joining together under the direction of Firestar, Leafdapple (later Leafstar), and Sharpclaw, her deputy later on. Firestar manages to kill the leader of the rats, after which the rats leave. During the rat attack, Firestar loses a life, leaving him with only seven, and a warrior called Rainfur is killed. Towards the end, Echosong dreams of dappled leaves, indicating that Leafdapple should be the new leader. She is named Leafstar and receives her nine lives, meeting Starclan. The former leaders that drove the ancient Skyclan out apologize in Starclan. Cherrypaw and Sparrowpaw are then made warriors (Cherrytail and Sparrowpelt) and Bouncekit, Tinykit, and Rockkit become apprentices (Bouncepaw, Tinypaw, and Rockpaw). The epilogue describes the birth of Squirrelkit and Leafkit, Firestar and Sandstorm's only kits.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{spent the}} next five years preaching to, and {{converting}} the pagan inhabitants of Sussex, the South Saxons. He also founded Selsey Abbey, on an estate near Selsey of 87 hides, given to Wilfrid by √Üthelwealh, king of the South Saxons. Bede attributes Wilfrid's ability to convert the South Saxons to his teaching <b>them</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fish, and contrasts it with the lack of success of the Irish monk Dicuill. Bede also says that the Sussex area had been experiencing a drought for three years before Wilfrid's arrival, but miraculously when Wilfrid arrived, and started baptising converts, rain began to fall. Wilfrid worked with Bishop Erkenwald of London, helping to set up the church in Sussex. Erkenwald also helped reconcile Wilfrid and Theodore before Theodore's death in 690. The mission was jeopardised when King √Üthelwealh died during an invasion of his kingdom by C√¶dwalla of Wessex. Wilfrid previously had contact with C√¶dwalla, and may have served as his spiritual advisor before C√¶dwalla's invasion of Sussex. After √Üthelwealh's death and C√¶dwalla's accession to the throne of Wessex, Wilfrid became one of the new king's advisors, and the king was converted. C√¶dwalla confirmed √Üthelwealh's grant of land in the Selsey area and Wilfrid built his cathedral church near the entrance to Pagham Harbour, believed to be what is now Church Norton.|$|E
