5|$|After the Astros drafted Richard, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to {{play for}} the Covington Astros, a rookie-level minor league {{baseball}} team in the Appalachian League. Richard started 12games for Covington, finishing with five wins and four losses. Despite accumulating an average of 11.41strikeouts per nine innings, Richard had trouble throughout the season with his pitching mechanics and control. In 56innings, Richard struck out 71batters but walked 52 and gave up 41earned runs, resulting in a 6.59 earned run average.|$|E
5|$|Nevill and June adopted Bamber {{when he was}} {{six months}} old. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to St Nicholas Primary and the private Maldon Court prep school, along with Sheila, {{followed}} by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, which he attended from September 1970. He was miserable there, not least because of bullying and a sexual assault. He left Gresham's with no qualifications, but attended sixth-form college and in 1978 passed seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where Bamber took a scuba-diving course, then New Zealand. Former friends alleged that he had broken into a jeweller's shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, {{of being involved in}} smuggling heroin.|$|E
25|$|Heine's {{parents were}} not {{particularly}} devout. As a young child <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to a Jewish school where he learned a smattering of Hebrew, but thereafter he attended Catholic schools. Here he learned French, which would be his second language - although he always spoke it with a German accent. He also acquired a lifelong love for Rhineland folklore.|$|E
5000|$|He made 11 {{appearances}} for the [...] Vodacom Cup and Currie Cup sides. <b>They</b> then <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to the International Rugby Academy in New Zealand, {{where he}} also had a short spell at New Zealand ITM Cup team Hawke's Bay Magpies.|$|R
50|$|When land {{surveyor}} K. (Ulrich Mühe) {{arrives at a}} small village that houses a castle, local authorities refuse {{to allow him to}} enter. As he tries to convince the officials that <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>him,</b> <b>they</b> clamp down with increasingly complicated bureaucratic obstacles.|$|R
50|$|Kreuter's career {{included}} the unusual occurrence {{that he was}} traded from the White Sox to the Angels twice. The White Sox <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> along with Tony Phillips to the Angels on May 18, 1997, and after he signed back with the Sox as a free-agent in the off-season, <b>they</b> again <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Anaheim on September 18, 1998.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} obtain the Order of Saint-Louis, de Puisaye {{purchased}} a colonelcy and an honorary position in the King's guard. He married Louise Le Sesne, the sole heiress of the marquis de Ménilles, on 19 June 1788. From this marriage he obtained an estate in Pacy-sur-Eure, Normandy, and he spent his time there or in Paris. There {{he was involved in}} drafting the cahier de doléance for the nobility of Perche, and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> as their delegate to the Estates General in 1789.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017 {{after seven}} months of not {{receiving}} a response from Pope Francis to their request that he clarify highly disputed parts in his apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia (The Joy of Love), four cardinals asked Francis for an audience in April but the Pope has yet to respond, it has emerged. In an April 25 letter hand-delivered to the Holy Father on May 6, Cardinals Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandmüller, Burke and Joachim Meisner wrote to Francis asking for an audience, having received no response to the dubia <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> on Sept 2016.|$|E
25|$|Björn {{was born}} at Tannstaðir, a remote farm on the Hrútafjörður in Húnavatnssýsla in {{north-western}} Iceland. Although the family was poor, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to school to the local priests, who recognized his intellectual abilities. In 1808, Björn passed an exam in Reykjavík, obtaining a recommendation by the bishop for studying {{at the university of}} Copenhagen. But these plans were delayed by the Gunboat War between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom. Only {{after the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars could Björn travel to Denmark and enrolled in 1817 at the University of Copenhagen, where he studied theology and mathematics. During his studies, he won the university's gold medal for mathematics twice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a turn. Mr. Prosper can marry if {{he likes}} it. <b>They</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> most abominable {{proposals}} {{as to the}} lady's money; and as to her jointure, I must stop that if I can, though I suppose he {{is not such a}} fool as to give way." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>him</b> at once, and Ralegh {{straightly}} taxed {{him with}} it. Sir Lewis as straightly admitted it, and when King thereupon {{charged him with}} deceit he showed no anger, but only the profoundest grief. He sank into a chair, and took {{his head in his}} hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the first}} I've heard of it, {{but you did}} quite right.

25|$|Sayama {{debuted in}} New Japan Pro Wrestling, against Shoji Kai, a jobber {{known to have}} been the debut {{opponent}} for future stars (Rusher Kimura, Masa Saito, Osamu Kido, Tatsumi Fujinami, and Mitsuo Momota had debuted against him before). Sayama weighed only 160 pounds, which, even given his training, impaired him from getting a permanent spot on NJPW cards. So <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> abroad, to England (where he wrestled as Sammy Lee) and Mexico, where he wrestled under his real name. It was in Mexico where he started to grow not only in physical stature but also in prominence, winning the NWA World Middleweight Title in EMLL.|$|E
25|$|Zanet Grigorakis was {{appointed}} bey of Mani and had assumed {{the name of}} Zanetbey. He however in 1798 was plotting with French agents who were sent by Napoleon to organise a Maniot invasion of the Peloponnese while Napoleon attacked the Levant. Once the Ottomans heard this, they had Zanet disposed and outlawed. Zanet however continued {{to communicate with the}} French and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> a shipment of weapons. Once the Ottomans heard of this, they sent an army under the command of the Capitán Pasha to lay siege to Zanet's island fort on Cranae. After a short siege Zanet fled from the forts and hid inland. The Ottomans then returned to their base in Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} Test début on 17 January 1958 against the West Indies at Bridgetown. He made 65 {{in the second}} innings, at one stage partnering Hanif Mohammad {{who went on to}} make 337. Saeed {{finished}} the series with 508 runs. Saeed went on to captain his side in three drawn Tests in 1968–69. His career ended in controversial circumstances when he declared himself unfit for the 3rd Test against Australia due to what he claimed was a back injury. In the previous Test he had been involved in a heated altercation with Dennis Lillee and thus the Pakistan management was sceptical about his injury. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> home for 'indiscipline'. He finished his career with five Test hundreds, in three of them he made over 150.|$|E
50|$|His {{handlers}} {{chose not}} to run him in the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes. Instead <b>they</b> later <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Garden State Park, where he won the Jersey Derby. For his performances in 1986, Snow Chief was named California Horse of the Year {{for the second straight}} year and was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.|$|R
60|$|When Bridge {{emerged from}} the bedroom he was clothed in white duck trousers, a soft shirt, {{and a pair of}} tennis shoes, and such a change had they wrought in his {{appearance}} that neither Grayson nor his employer would have known him had they not seen him come from the room into which <b>they</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to make the exchange of clothing.|$|R
50|$|Boxer {{fights in}} the Battle of the Cowshed and the Battle of the Windmill, but is upset {{when he thinks}} he has killed a stable boy when, in fact, he had only stunned him. this shows that he is gentle in nature, even when dealing with an enemy. When Boxer defends Snowball's {{reputation}} from Squealer's revisionism, the pigs designate him as a target for the Great Purge, but he easily out muscles the dog executioners, sparing them at Napoleon's request. His death shows how far the pigs are willing to go. When he collapses from overwork, the pigs say <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to a veterinarian, when <b>they</b> actually have <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to the knacker's yard to be slaughtered, in exchange for {{money to buy a}} case of whiskey for the pigs to enjoy.|$|R
25|$|On {{his return}} to England, he allied himself with the Tories, and {{received}} his reward in being contrasted, much to his advantage, with the Whig victor of Blenheim and Malplaquet. The differences between the three peers, Peterborough, Galway and Tyrawley, who had served in Spain, formed the subject of angry debates in the House of Lords, when the majority declared for Peterborough; after some fiery speeches the resolution that he had performed many great and eminent services was carried, and votes of thanks were passed to him without any division (January and February 1708). His new friends were not desirous of detaining him long on English soil, and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{on a mission to}} Vienna, where he characteristically engaged the ministry in pledges of which they disapproved. His resentment at this disagreement was softened by the command of a cavalry regiment, and by his appointment as a Knight of the Garter (August 1713). With the accession of George I, Lord Peterborough's influence was gone. Worn out with suffering, he died at Lisbon on 25 October 1735. His remains were brought to England, and buried at Turvey in Bedfordshire on 21 November.|$|E
500|$|Hergé read {{a variety}} of books about Tibet for this project: Fosco Maraini's Secret Tibet, Heinrich Harrer's Seven Years in Tibet, Tsewang Pemba's Tibet my Homeland, Maurice Herzog's Annapurna, discredited author Lobsang Rampa's The Third Eye, and the books of Belgian {{explorer}} and spiritualist Alexandra David-Néel. Hergé visited the Belgian Alpine Society to examine their photographic collection of the Himalayas, and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> photographer Richard Lannoy's work on India. [...] Models for drawings such as of monks with musical instruments, Sherpas with backpacks, and the aircraft wreckage came from clippings Hergé had collected from sources such as National Geographic. Members of the Studios helped him gather other source material; for instance, collaborator Jacques Martin researched and drew the story's costumes.|$|E
500|$|Believing {{his life}} was {{endangered}} by the revolt, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to an internment camp in Italy. The idea of an independent Montenegro was abandoned, and the Italians opted for a military governorate. Several months later, Drljević escaped and smuggled himself into the German-controlled area of the NDH. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, he moved back to Zemun. In the summer of 1944 Drljević relocated to Zagreb, where he created a Montenegrin State Council in the NDH {{with the assistance of}} the Germans and Croats. He also published a pamphlet in Zagreb titled Who are the Serbs? (...) [...] In it, he blamed supposedly [...] "aggressive" [...] Serb policies for all past and modern problems in the Balkans, presented ethnic Serbs as a [...] "degenerate race" [...] and pointed out their similarities with Jews.|$|E
60|$|The Tyrians {{wished to}} avoid a quarrel if it were possible. <b>They</b> <b>sent</b> {{complimentary}} messages to Alexander, congratulating him on his conquests, and disavowing all feelings of hostility to <b>him.</b> <b>They</b> also <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> a golden crown, {{as many of the}} other states of Asia had done, in token of their yielding a general submission to his authority. Alexander returned very gracious replies, and expressed to them his intention of coming to Tyre for the purpose of offering sacrifices, as he said, to Hercules, a god whom the Tyrians worshiped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{that not}} everything?" [...] cried Chandos impatiently. [...] "Can you not see, oh foolish Master Wintersole, that the French suspect {{we are about}} to make some attempt and that <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> Peter the Red Ferret, as <b>they</b> have <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> many times before, to get tidings of whither we are bound? Now that he knows that the stores are for Calais, then the French near Calais will take his warning, and so the King's whole plan come to nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|There dwelt {{also not}} far from thence one Mr. Skill, an ancient and well-approved physician. So Christiana desired it and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> for <b>him,</b> and he came. When he was entered the room, and had a little {{observed}} the boy, he concluded that he was sick of the gripes. Then {{he said to his}} mother, [...] "What diet has Matthew of late fed upon?" ...|$|R
500|$|On 28 June 2007 the McCanns {{suggested}} to the Polícia Judiciária {{that the police}} request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a [...] "matter orientation system", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites. On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his [...] "BS detector to go off the scale". Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In {{the second week of}} June <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a [...] "static signal" [...] in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Willkie reached age 14 and {{enrolled}} in Elwood High School, {{his parents were}} concerned about a lack of discipline and a slight stoop, and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to Culver Military Academy for a summer {{in an attempt to}} correct both. Willkie began to shine as a student in high school, inspired by his English teacher; one classmate said that Philip [...] "Pat" [...] Bing [...] "fixed that boy up. He started preaching to Wendell to get to work and that kid went to town." [...] Faced with a set of athletic brothers—Edward became an Olympic wrestler—Willkie joined the football team but had little success; he enjoyed the debate team more, but was several times disciplined for arguing with teachers. He was class president his final year, and president of the most prominent fraternity, but resigned from the latter when a sorority blackballed his girlfriend, Gwyneth Harry, as the daughter of immigrants.|$|E
500|$|But {{some time}} later, Calvin Comfort, a [...] "prohibited mailing specialist" [...] for the region, found Jacobson's name in another file, and the {{government}} decided to try again, this time {{as part of an}} operation aimed at purchasers. In May 1986, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> mail from another fictitious organization, [...] "Midlands Data Research", which was for those who [...] "believe in the joys of sex and the complete awareness of those lusty and youthful lads and lasses of the neophite [...] age". Jacobson confessed to them that he was [...] "interested in teenage sexuality", asked for more information and that his name be kept confidential. This led to Jacobson getting mail from the [...] "Heartland Institute for a New Tomorrow" [...] (HINT), [...] "an organization founded to protect and promote sexual freedom and freedom of choice. We believe that arbitrarily imposed legislative sanctions restricting your sexual freedom should be rescinded through the legislative process." [...] Jacobson seemed to sympathize, writing in response that sexual freedom and freedom of the press were under attack by [...] "right-wing fundamentalists".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} better pleased if <b>they</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> back to Constantinople, {{or one of the}} islands of the Levant," [...] Mr. Hammond said.

50|$|After {{the battle}} of Cepeda he joined the federalist army {{commanded}} by Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez. <b>They</b> then <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> as their representative to the Buenos Aires Cabildo, whom he convinced to name him provincial governor. He assumed the governorship on February 18, 1820 and soon after he signed the Treay of Pilar with the federalist chiefs, through which the Buenos Aires province agreed {{to be recognized as}} equal to the other United Provinces.|$|R
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Æthelstan {{built on}} his grandfather's efforts to revive ecclesiastical scholarship, which {{had fallen to}} a low state {{in the second half}} of the ninth century. John Blair {{described}} Æthelstan's achievement as [...] "a determined reconstruction, visible to us especially through the circulation and production of books, of the shattered ecclesiastical culture". He was renowned in his own day for his piety and promotion of sacred learning. His interest in education, and his reputation as a collector of books and relics, attracted a cosmopolitan group of ecclesiastical scholars to his court, particularly Bretons and Irish. Æthelstan gave extensive aid to Breton clergy who had fled Brittany following its conquest by the Vikings in 919. He made a confraternity agreement with the clergy of Dol Cathedral in Brittany, who were then in exile in central France, and <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> the relics of Breton saints, apparently hoping for his patronage. The contacts resulted in a surge in interest in England for commemorating Breton saints. One of the most notable scholars at Æthelstan's court was Israel the Grammarian, who may have been a Breton. Israel and [...] "a certain Frank" [...] drew a board game called [...] "Gospel Dice" [...] for an Irish bishop, Dub Innse, who took it home to Bangor. Æthelstan's court played a crucial role in the origins of the English monastic reform movement.|$|E
2500|$|The work of Nicolae Constantin Batzaria was {{the subject}} of {{critical}} reevaluation during the last decades of the communist regime, when Romania was ruled by Nicolae Ceaușescu. Writing at the time, Kemal H. Karpat argued: [...] "Lately {{there seems to be a}} revived interest in [...] children's stories." [...] During the period, Romania's literary scene included several authors whose talents had been first noticed by Batzaria when, as children, <b>they</b> <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> their debut works. Such figures include Ștefan Cazimir, Barbu Cioculescu and Mioara Cremene.|$|E
60|$|When {{this answer}} was {{reported}} {{to the people of}} Cyme, they did not dare to give Pactyas up, nor, on the other hand, did they dare to incur the enmity of the Persians by retaining and protecting <b>him.</b> <b>They</b> accordingly <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> secretly away. The emissaries of Mazares, however, followed him. They kept constantly on his track, demanding him successively of every city where the hapless fugitive sought refuge, until, at length, partly by threats and partly by a reward, they induced a certain city to surrender <b>him.</b> Mazares <b>sent</b> <b>him,</b> a prisoner, to Cyrus. Soon after this Mazares himself died, and Harpagus was appointed governor of Lydia in his stead.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 15 his father, {{following}} {{the traditions of the}} mercantile bourgeoisie of Cádiz to which <b>they</b> belonged, <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> to England to become familiar with the ways of commerce. Fermín stayed in London and Liverpool for five years. But he was more devoted to studying the social problems of the time than the mercantile trade. He read the works of Owen, Paine and Berdlow. He returned to Cádiz at 21, with a yearning to reform society, influenced by the doctrines of utopian socialism. He was also known for his tolerance and generosity.|$|R
6000|$|Kindly and considerately <b>they</b> had <b>sent</b> <b>him</b> {{on before}} with Martyn. [...] In {{a quarter of}} an hour's time his good doctor came in with Lawrence Frith, a {{considerable}} contrast to our poor Clarence, for the slim gypsy lad had developed into a strikingly handsome man, still slender and lithe, but with a fine bearing, and his bronzed complexion suiting well with his dark shining hair and beautiful eyes. They had brought some of the luggage, and the doctor insisted that his patient should go to bed directly, and rest completely before trying to talk.|$|R
