5|$|<b>Tonsillectomy</b> {{may be a}} {{reasonable}} preventive measure in those with frequent throat infections (more than three a year). However, the benefits are small and episodes typically lessen in time regardless of measures taken. Recurrent episodes of pharyngitis which test positive for GAS may also represent {{a person who is}} a chronic carrier of GAS who is getting recurrent viral infections. Treating people who have been exposed but who are without symptoms is not recommended. Treating people who are carriers of GAS is not recommended as the risk of spread and complications is low.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a <b>tonsillectomy.</b> The following year, the cancer had spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E
5|$|Diffie {{has been}} married three times. His first wife was Janise Parker, whom he married while in college. The couple had two children, Parker and Kara, then {{divorced}} in 1986. Parker later worked as Diffie's on-road manager in the mid-2000s, and in mid-2010, he and Kara auditioned for American Idol. Two years after divorcing Janise, Diffie married Debbie Jones, a nurse technician. They had two sons, Drew and Tyler, the latter of whom was born with Down syndrome and nearly died in 1991 following complications from a <b>tonsillectomy.</b> Diffie began an affair with Liz Allison, the widow of NASCAR driver Davey Allison, in 1993. In 1994, a judge ordered Diffie to pay Jones $3,000 per month towards their pending divorce settlement, and not to allow Drew and Tyler {{to be in the}} presence of any girlfriend; he divorced Jones in 1996. In 2000, Diffie married the former Theresa Crump, whom he met at a concert, at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. They have one daughter, Kylie Tarissa, born in 2004.|$|E

40|$|Current {{views on}} the {{indications}} and techniques for <b>tonsillectomies</b> in children Martine FRANÇOIS There are two principal indications for <b>tonsillectomies</b> or ablation of palatal tonsillar tissue: repeated episodes of tonsillitis (at least 5 times per year in two successive years) and obstructive tonsillar tissue as well as another, more rare, indication, highly asymmetrical blocs of tonsillar tissue that may suggest presence of a lymphoma. When tonsils are obstructive in patients suffering from sleep apnea, the indication for excision is formal and requires prompt attention. In other cases of enlarged tonsils the indication for surgery can be discussed but practitioners must inform parents of the possible maxillofacial complications that may develop because of chronic pharyngeal blockage. Surgeons perform <b>tonsillectomies</b> on children under general anesthesia, protecting the lower airways by intubation. Post-operative pain after surgery is constant and practitioners {{must be prepared to}} manage it in conformity with the age of patients and the difficulties they have in swallowing...|$|R
5|$|Returning to Australia, Downes was {{discharged}} from the AIF, but remained in the Army as a reservist. He became an honorary consulting surgeon at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, and honorary surgeon at Prince Henry's Hospital. He was a founding fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927, and {{became president of the}} Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935. He established {{a reputation as one of}} Melbourne's leading paediatric surgeons, but found himself in disagreement with certain medical practices then in vogue. In a 1922 paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia, he examined 100 cases of <b>tonsillectomy</b> in children, and concluded that the majority of them were unnecessary. It would be another four decades before the medical profession in Australia accepted this. He lectured on medical ethics at the University of Melbourne from the late 1930s until his death in 1945, and wrote a course textbook on the subject, entitled Medical Ethics, which was published in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Young {{missed the}} start of the 1965–66 season with an illness that {{resulted}} in a <b>tonsillectomy.</b> He marked his return to the team with two goals against Coventry City. Up until this point in his career, Young had usually played on the left wing. However, encouraged by Mercer and Allison to shoot more frequently, his position began to vary. Against Leyton Orient, Young was deployed as an inside forward, and scored a hat-trick. He also played inside-forward in an FA Cup tie against Leicester City, and scored the winning goal against a team from the division above. By January, Manchester City were top of the Second Division. The club only lost one match in the remainder of the season, and won the Second Division Championship by a five-point margin. Young finished as the club's highest goalscorer, with 17 goals.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a <b>tonsillectomy.</b> DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARYBackgroundThe {{laryngeal}} mask airway {{is a medical}} device that must be used with precise indications and contraindications. Its use in <b>tonsillectomies</b> and adenoidectomies {{has been reported to}} generate controversy. Through the present study an attempt is made to evaluate the effectiveness and the security of the {{laryngeal mask}} airway in <b>tonsillectomies</b> and adenoidectomies. Methods: A systematic review. Results: 16 studies were obtained {{as a result of the}} systematic search of the published evidence. They were analyzed with methodological rigor and the following results were obtained: The flexible laryngeal mask airway brings about fewer respiratory adverse effects during the induction and the emergence of anesthesia than the endotracheal tube. It is effective in preventing sanguineous bronchoaspiration during surgery. Furthermore, it must be used by trained personnel and in collaboration with the surgeon to avoid adverse events like displacement, obstruction or occupation of the operating field. Conclusions: the flexible laryngeal mask airway is a useful and safe alternative for the handling of the airways in <b>tonsillectomies</b> and adenoidectomies by its advantages in the induction and emergence of surgery since it triggers less protective reflections of the airway at the moment. In order to avoid intraoperating complications one must have experience in its use plus empathy must exist between the surgical team and the anesthesiologist...|$|R
25|$|For {{the past}} 50 years at least, <b>tonsillectomy</b> has been {{performed}} by dissecting the tonsil from its surrounding fascia, a so-called 'total', or extra-capsular <b>tonsillectomy.</b> Problems including pain and bleeding {{led to a}} recent resurgence in interest in sub-total <b>tonsillectomy</b> or 'tonsillotomy' which was popular 60–100 years ago, {{in an effort to}} reduce these complications. The generally accepted procedure for 'total' <b>tonsillectomy</b> uses a scalpel and blunt dissection or electrocautery, although harmonic scalpels or lasers have also been used. Bleeding is stopped with electrocautery, ligation by sutures, and the topical use of thrombin, a protein that induces blood clotting.|$|E

40|$|Introduction This paper {{presents}} available {{epidemiological data}} on number {{and types of}} surgeries of Waldeyer’s ring over a sixty-year period, {{as well as their}} interactions. Results Out of 80. 477 patients operated on in the period from December 1, 1939 to Dec 31, 1998, statistical survey included 56. 564 patients (Table 1). 26. 808 (46. 57 %) patients were operated in local anesthesia, 23. 833 (41. 40 %) under ether narcosis, and 6. 923 (12. 026 %) patients were operated on under general endotracheal anesthesia. 38. 846 (67. 48 %) <b>tonsillectomies,</b> 12. 864 (22. 34 %) tonsilloadenoidectomies and 5. 854 (10. 16 %) adenoidectomies were performed. Discussion The percentage of these surgeries is very high, but in the past ten years it has fallen below 50 %. General endotracheal anesthesia is being used at the Department since 1966, and ether anesthesia is not being used since 1991. We believe that the number of <b>tonsillectomies</b> is high, because it also includes surgeries performed under local anesthesia, in patients over ten years of age.

50|$|Dr. William Hunter CB FRSE (1861-1937) was a British surgeon known {{primarily}} for his theories on oral sepsis, {{one of the}} inspirations for the Henry Cotton theory of focal sepsis {{which led to the}} increased number of tooth extractions and <b>tonsillectomies</b> in the 1910s and 20s (under the presumption that hidden sepsis could lead to a wider health decline in individuals). By the 1930s, this view had fallen out of favor, but not until after thousands of surgeries had been performed.|$|R

25|$|<b>Tonsillectomy</b> is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although <b>tonsillectomy</b> is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in children in the United States and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|Microdebrider: The microdebrider is a powered rotary shaving {{device with}} {{continuous}} suction often used during sinus surgery. It {{is made up}} of a cannula or tube, connected to a hand piece, which in turn is connected to a motor with foot control and a suction device. The endoscopic microdebrider is used in performing a partial <b>tonsillectomy,</b> by partially shaving the tonsils. This procedure entails eliminating the obstructive portion of the tonsil while preserving the tonsillar capsule. A natural biologic dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal muscles, preventing injury, inflammation, and infection. The procedure results in less post-operative pain, a more rapid recovery, and perhaps fewer delayed complications. However, the partial <b>tonsillectomy</b> is suggested for enlarged tonsils – not those that incur repeated infections.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} {{meeting the}} strict criteria for surgery, short term benefit means that without <b>tonsillectomy</b> {{a child who}} meets these strict criteria will probably have 6 sore throats {{in the next two}} years while one who has surgery will probably have 3 sore throats.
