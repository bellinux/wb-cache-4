50|$|The first Seattle {{fortunes}} {{were founded}} on logs, and later milled <b>timber,</b> <b>shipped</b> south {{for the construction}} of buildings in San Francisco. Seattle itself, in the early years, was, of course, also a place of wooden buildings, and remained so until the Great Fire of June 6, 1889. Even the early system of delivering water to the settlement used hollowed-out logs for pipes. Seattle in its early years relied on the <b>timber</b> industry, <b>shipping</b> logs (and, later, milled timber) to San Francisco.|$|R

2500|$|In later {{decades after}} {{the repeal of the}} tariff and the {{increase}} of competition, the quality and safety of the ships improved markedly. Since the travellers would bring along their own food and bedding the trade was an extremely easy one to operate. All that was required was a few advertisements, generally in Irish newspapers, and the installation of bunks {{along the side of the}} hold. An average <b>timber</b> <b>ship</b> could thus carry about 200 passengers. Even with only a fraction of the hundreds of <b>timber</b> <b>ships</b> carrying passengers, this created an unprecedented influx of new inhabitants. [...] By comparison, it has been calculated that the trade between New France and Europe only included an average sixty-six immigrants per year over the lifetime of that colony.|$|R
