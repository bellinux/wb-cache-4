The study of English, however, remained less defined {{and it became a}} goal of the New Critical movement to justify literature in an age of science by separating the work from its author and critic (see Wimsatt and Beardsley's Intentional fallacy and Affective fallacy) and by examining it as a self-sufficient artifact. In Brooks's use of the paradox as a <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> <b>analysis,</b> however, he develops a logical case as a literary technique with strong emotional effect.

In 1968, Siegfried Englemann used operant conditioning techniques in a combination with rule learning to produce the direct instruction curriculum. In addition, Fred S. Keller used similar techniques to develop programmed instruction. B.F. Skinner developed a programmed instruction curriculum for teaching handwriting. One of Skinner's students, Ogden Lindsley, developed a standardized semilogrithmic chart, the [...] "Standard Behavior Chart," [...] now [...] "Standard Celeration Chart," [...] used to record frequencies of behavior, and to allow direct visual comparisons of both frequencies and changes in those frequencies (termed [...] "celeration").

Susan Thomas, long time professional educator with Wolfensberger, continues to teach through the Institute at Syracuse University as of 2012.
