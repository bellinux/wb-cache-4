40|$|The use of {{analytic}} {{methods for}} extracting learning strategies from trace data has attracted considerable {{attention in the}} literature. However, there is a paucity of research examining any association between learning strategies extracted from trace data and responses to well-established self-report instruments and performance scores. This paper focuses on the link between <b>the</b> <b>learning</b> strategies identified in the trace data and student reported approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>The</b> paper reports {{on the findings of}} a study conducted in the scope of an undergraduate engineering course (N= 144) that followed a flipped classroom design. The study found that learning strategies extracted from trace data can be interpreted in terms of deep and surface approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>The</b> detected significant links with self-report measures are with small effect sizes for both the overall deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> scale and <b>the</b> deep strategy scale. However, there was no observed significance linking <b>the</b> surface approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and surface strategy nor were there significant associations with motivation scales of approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>The</b> significant effects on academic performance were found, and consistent with the literature that used self-report instruments showing that students who followed a deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> had a significantly higher performance...|$|R
