5000|$|By 1984 {{the basic}} Mailbox service had been {{extended}} to give automatic access to the Telex service {{which at the time}} was still relatively common in business and was the standard way to reach remoter parts of the globe. Using a special Telex Link page, the message was composed in the usual way and then the destination country chosen and the <b>Telex</b> <b>number</b> entered before sending just like a standard message. Telex Link added the necessary Telex codes as required and tried to send the message as many times as required before positively confirming receipt by means of a special Mailbox message. Telexes could be sent to Prestel Mailbox users from a standard Telex terminal by using Telex Link number and inserting [...] "MBX" [...] and the relevant mailbox number as the first line of the telex message itself. The incoming telex message appeared to the Prestel recipient just as an ordinary Mailbox message but with the <b>telex</b> <b>number</b> inserted {{at the top of the}} frame.|$|E

40|$|The {{bulletin}} provides technical, {{economic and}} managerial assessment of emergency storage systems. It {{is based on}} investigations conducted by ODNRI and on information provided by users from the World Food Programme and five relief agencies. Where the priority was provision of food shelters quickly and easily, with facilities for rapid relocation, users favoured a combination of tarpaulins, tents and plastic-covered metal frame structures. Where the priority was security/ease of management, traditional warehouses or frameless modular structures were superior, more permanent and had a lower annual cost {{after four years of}} use. In either case if stores could be provided locally this was generally preferable - for reasons of speed and economy - to provision of imported stores, of which {{there are a number of}} well-tested types. Part I of the bulletin provides background, research and tables showing operational comparisons, capital costs, procurement times, packed weights and annual costs for the main store types. Recommendations for research on design of stores capable of resisting tropical wind loads and on bumper crop storage are made. Part II summarizes the results in Part I and provides for users/donors/ governments: (a) a practical decision tree for choosing a store, (b) a method for calculating store capacity, and (c) a catalogue of suppliers giving product details for freight, costs and <b>telex</b> <b>numbers.</b> Suppliers of pallets are included...|$|R
40|$|IAALD, a {{non-profit}} making association {{was founded in}} 1955. The aims of the association are to promote, internationally and nationally, agricultural library science and documentation, {{as well as the}} professional interests of agricultural librarians and documentalists. The term 'agriculture' is interpreted in its widest sense, so as to include forestry, agricultural engineering, veterinary science, fisheries, food and nutrition, and agricultural food industries. The Association's membership of 600 is drawn from sixty countries and comprises agricultural research institutions, international organizations, professional associations and individual members. The Association produces a quarterly bulletin in English, French, Spanish and German covering news in the field of bibliography and documentation of agriculture and allied subjects. IAALD has also produced a Primer for agricultural libraries, reports on the seven World Congresses of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists as well as proceedings of IAALD meetings. A milestone in the advancement of agricultural information and transfer and improved communications between agricultural universities and information centres worldwide has been the recently completed Agricultural Information Resource Centres: a world directory 1990. It represents the culmination of four years' work by US-based World Directory Working Group of IAALD. The Directory includes 3971 information resource centres that have agriculture-related collections and/or information services. Most of the information was obtained d directly from questionnaires completed by the institutions concerned, though {{in the case of the}} Soviet Union a Russian directory, The libraries of the agri-industrial complex in the USSR was used. Each institution was asked to provide its name, acronym, former name, year founded, type, postal address, actual location, name and telephone number of the head of the resource centre, fax and <b>telex</b> <b>numbers,</b> number of professional and other staff, size of collection, number 0 journal subscriptions, main language of the collection and set vices, subjects and specie strengths, unique in-house databases, database vendors used and loan service and photocopy policies.

5000|$|The telex {{numbering}} plan, {{usually a}} six-digit {{number in the}} United States, {{was based on the}} major exchange where the customer's telex machine terminated. For example, all telex customers that terminated in the New York City exchange were assigned a <b>telex</b> <b>number</b> that started with a first digit [...] "1". Further, all Chicago-based customers had telex numbers that started with a first digit of [...] "2". This numbering plan was maintained by Western Union as the telex exchanges proliferated to smaller cities in the United States. The Western Union Telex network was built on three levels of exchanges. The highest level was made up of the nine exchange cities previously mentioned. Each of these cities had the dual capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections to multiple distant telex exchanges. The second level of exchanges, located in large cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami, Newark, Pittsburgh and Seattle, were similar to the highest level of exchanges in capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections. However, these second level exchanges had a smaller customer line capacity and only had trunk circuits to regional cities. The third level of exchanges, located in small to medium-sized cities, could terminate telex customer lines and had a single trunk group running to its parent exchange.|$|E
