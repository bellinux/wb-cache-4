5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate.

5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a rodent in {{the genus}} Oryzomys of family Cricetidae from {{interior}} western Mexico, {{in the states}} of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán.

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{breaches}} in flood defenses around Ise Bay, seawater continued to pour into inundated areas after Vera's passage, slowing down repair efforts. One breach spanning 150km (93mi) across required 5,000personnel, 32,000sandbags, and bulldozers dispatched by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to relieve water flow. In Aichi's Ama District, reconstruction efforts for levees, roadways, and infrastructure lasted {{until the end of}} December1959. Due to losses sustained by the pearl industry as {{a result of}} the typhoon, Japanese pearl production in 1959 was expected to decrease by 30% in 1959, with production losses of 40% expected in 1960. Monetary losses to the industry were expected to eclipse US$15million, causing Japanese pearl costs to hike up by 20%. Furthermore, the effects of Vera on the country's pearl industry were expected <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> for two to three years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice <b>to</b> <b>persist,</b> or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Goni {{maintained}} much of {{its strength}} while traversing the East China Sea, as low wind shear allowed convection <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> around the eyewall. Goni made landfall on southwestern Japan near Uki, Kumamoto, at 19:00UTC on August19, and shortly thereafter it struck Arao. The convection diminished while interacting with Japan's mountainous terrain, leaving the storm's center exposed once it entered the much cooler Sea of Japan. Around 12:00UTC on August25, Goni transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants turned northward and moved ashore near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East on August26. Former Typhoon Goni turned westward and entered northeastern China {{in the province of}} Heilongjiang. The storm stalled over northeastern China for several days, before dissipating on August30.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tracy Adams {{describes}} Isabeau as {{a talented}} diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. Charles had been crowned in 1387, aged 20, attaining sole {{control of the}} monarchy. His first acts included the dismissal of his uncles and the reinstatement of the so-called Marmousets—a group of councilors to his father, Charles V—and he gave Orléans more responsibility. Some years later, after Charles' first attack of illness, tensions mounted between Orléans and the royal uncles—Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Forced to assume {{a greater role in}} maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as peacekeeper among the various court factions.|$|E

Karthik started the tour of Zimbabwe with 40 in a warm-up match against the Zimbabwe Board XI.

India scored heavily against their weakened opponents, amassing 554 and 366 in their completed innings, but Karthik failed on both occasions, twice making a single.|$|E
5|$|In early July2007, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather began <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> in the South China Sea roughly 155mi (250km) {{southeast of}} Hainan. The Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0000UTC on July3 after the storm had organized sufficiently, however, other tracking agencies did not indicate that tropical cyclogenesis had occurred at the time. However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the disturbance for potential signs of tropical cyclogenesis at 0100UTC later that day, At the time, the storm system was situated in an area of weak to moderate wind shear, exposing the disturbance's low-level circulation center. Despite the prevailing conditions and proximity to land, the storm continued to organize, and as such the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 0130UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|In late July2003, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather began <b>to</b> <b>persist</b> {{northwest of}} Chuuk in the Philippine Sea, and was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) early on July30. As atmospheric conditions remained favorable throughout the day's duration, the system organized, and was upgraded to tropical depression status by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 0600UTC on July31, followed by the JTWC at 0600UTC and Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) six hours later. The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes. Tracking north-northwestward {{under the influence of}} a passing trough, the system intensified further into a tropical storm by 0600UTC on August2, thus receiving the name Morakot. At the time, the storm was well organized with a steady outflow pattern.|$|E
