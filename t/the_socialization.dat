25|$|Parental {{views are}} perhaps the most {{essential}} factor in determining <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent's occupational status. Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious independent thinkers, while working class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective with a strong respect for authority. Middle class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values while working class parents emphasize external values.|$|E

Descriptivequalitative approach was applied in the research. The techniques of data collecting used were indepth interview, participatory observation, and content analysis. The quotation technique was based on purposive and snowball samplings.

From the result of the research, it can be concluded that the existence of carving art in Jepara was much influenced by <b>the</b> network of <b>socialization</b> process, both direct and indirect, of carving art values. The network of direct socialization process ran through formal and informal ways; while the network of indirect socialization process ran through informal ways. <b>The</b> formal <b>socialization</b> took place in educational institutions from Kindergartens, Elementary Schools, to Junior High Schools, while <b>the</b> informal <b>socialization</b> took places in apprenticeship and business environment. <b>The</b> indirect <b>socialization</b> took place in families, among peer friends, in mosques, and in mass media...|$|R

25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization would result in <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, {{when it was announced}} that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E

During the late Eastern Han, disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese history.

It opens with the earlier released [...] "Bow Down", before seguing into an excerpt of a speech by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of girls.

500|$|Compulsory Miseducation is a {{critique}} of American public schools written by Paul Goodman and published by Horizon Press in 1964. Already established as a social critic of American society {{and the role of}} its youth in his previous book Growing Up Absurd (1960), [...] Goodman argues in Compulsory Miseducation against the necessity of schools for <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of youth and recommends their abolition. He suggests that formal education lasts too long, teaches the wrong social class values, and increasingly damages students over time. Goodman writes that the school reflects the misguided and insincere values of its society and thus school reformers should focus on these values before schools. He proposes a variety of alternatives to school including no school, the city or farm as school, apprenticeships, guided travel, and youth organizations. Reviewers complimented Goodman's style and noted his deliberate contrarianism, but were split on the feasibility of his proposals. Goodman's book was a precursor to the work of deschooling advocate Ivan Illich.|$|E
500|$|Kirchner {{was often}} {{labelled}} a left-wing and progressive president, {{with the cultural}} critic Alejandro Kaufman stating that Kirchner was [...] "an Argentine social democrat: a centre-left Peronist", who had been elected on a [...] "moderate-progressive" [...] platform. However, that assessment is relative. Although he was left of previous Argentine presidents from Raúl Alfonsín to Eduardo Duhalde and contemporary Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, he was right of other Latin American presidents such as Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro. Kirchner's nationalist approach to the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute was closer to the right, {{and he did not}} consider left-wing policies such as <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of production or the nationalization of public services which were privatized during the Menem presidency. He did not attempt to modify church–state relations or reduce the armed forces. Kirchner's economic views were influenced by his tenure in the government of Santa Cruz: a province rich in oil, gas, fish and tourism, with an economy focused on the primary sector. Usually avoiding long-term policies, he moved left or right according to circumstances. Many leftist activists in Argentina were cynical about the sincerity of his commitment to progressive ideals and to aiding the country's underclass.|$|E

2500|$|On December 11, the PSDR {{transformed}} {{itself into}} the Socialist Party of Romania. Its program, written down by Șerban Voinea in 1919, specified that the members stood for [...] "scientific socialism" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of property, but also for reformism (in {{the absence of a}} revolutionary class). The PS was immediately approached for secretive talks by radicalized members of the establishment, grouped in the People's Party (PP). The central issue was the PS' nominal support for republicanism, which was also espoused by some of the PP doctrinaires—though not by the party leader, General Alexandru Averescu. In exchange for support, Averescu was ready to co-opt the PS into a future government. Moscovici was among the PS representatives who discussed the matter with PP emissaries Constantin Argetoianu and P. P. Negulescu. In the end, the socialists were adamant in their rejection of a compromise.|$|E

The revolt was put down one year later. In 1876, field workers in various regions rebelled against taxes, usurpation of lands and oppression against political prisoners. Another revolt occurred in 1887 in the Tlapa regions, led by Silverio Leon. In 1891, a movement led by José Cuevas has a messianic character to it and worked to bring down the Diaz government. [...] In this case, federal control over much of Guerrero was weakened. In the 1900s, a number of intellectuals, including Eusebio S.

2500|$|Prior to {{the fall}} of the Aztec, the Aztec people had a stable economy driven by a {{successful}} trade market. The markets, which were located in the center of many communities, were well organized and diverse in goods, as noted by the Spanish conquistadors upon their arrival. The regional merchants, known as tlacuilo, would barter utilitarian items and food, which included gold, silver, and other precious stones, cloth and cotton, animal skins, both agriculture and wild game, and woodwork. [...] The trade market of the Aztec people was not only important to commerce, but also to <b>the</b> <b>socialization,</b> as the markets provided a place for the people to exchange information within their regions. This type of trade market was used primarily for locally produced goods, as there was not much traveling needed to exchange goods at the market. With no domestic animals as an effective way to transport goods, the local markets were an essential part of Aztec commerce. However, the Aztec nobility obtained much of their merchandise from neighboring highland basins, distant places within the empire, and from land beyond the empire therefore creating the need for a long distance trade organization.|$|E

60|$|It is only {{an initial}} recognition, a mere first raid into a great and largely {{unexplored}} province of study. This province is in the broadest terms, social psychology. A huge amount of thought, discussion, experiment, {{is to be done}} in this field--needs imperatively to be done before the process of <b>the</b> <b>socialization</b> of economic life can go very far beyond its present attainments. Except for these first admissions, Socialism has concerned itself only with the material reorganization of Society and its social consequences, with economic changes and the reaction of these changes on administrative work; it has either accepted existing intellectual conditions and political institutions as beyond its control or assumed that they will obediently modify as economic and administrative necessity dictates. Declare the Social revolution, we were told in a note of cheery optimism by the Marxist apostles, and political institutions will come like flowers in May!
