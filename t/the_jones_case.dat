2500|$|During {{a lengthy}} United Service Organizations (USO) {{tour in the}} Philippines, Jones fell ill in 1945, and was treated by a doctor who was still alive when Candy publicised her mind-control claims; Donald Bain gave this doctor the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Gilbert Jensen".

2500|$|During the {{deposition}} in <b>the</b> <b>Jones</b> <b>case,</b> Clinton was asked, [...] "Have {{you ever had}} sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit1, as modified by the Court?" [...] The definition included contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of a person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of that person, any contact of the genitals or anus of another person, or contact of one's genitals or anus and any part of another person's body either directly or through clothing. The judge ordered that Clinton be {{given an opportunity to}} review the agreed definition. Clinton flatly denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Later, at the Starr grand jury, Clinton stated that he believed the definition of [...] "sexual relations" [...] agreed upon for the Jones deposition excluded his receiving oral sex.|$|E

In accordance with earlier results from retina, JONES binding could not be detected in SDS gels from developing brain. Binding of the antibody was, however, prominent in chloroform/methanol extracts of the same tissues, and it was completely removed from tissue sections by brief chloroform/methanol treatment. Enzymatic analyses of chloroform/methanol extracts indicated that <b>the</b> <b>JONES</b> epitope was sensitive to neuraminidase but insensitive to proteases...|$|R
2500|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} transferred {{her from}} the White House to the Pentagon because they felt she was {{spending too much time}} around Clinton. At the Pentagon, she worked as an assistant to chief Pentagon spokesperson Kenneth Bacon. [...] Lewinsky told co-worker Linda Tripp about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In December 1997, Lewinsky left the Pentagon position. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and had attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in that case, Tripp gave the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, adding to his ongoing investigation into the Whitewater controversy. Starr then broadened his investigation beyond the Arkansas land use deal to include Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible perjury and subornation of perjury in <b>the</b> <b>Jones</b> <b>case.</b> Tripp reported the taped conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg. She also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their relationship, and not to dry clean what would later become known as [...] "the blue dress". Under oath, Clinton denied having had [...] "a sexual affair", [...] "sexual relations", or [...] "a sexual relationship" [...] with Lewinsky.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{analyses}} key images which, although personal to the Welsh poet/painter David Jones's particular experiences, became conduits for {{his expression}} of universal themes that he explored though his painting and poetry {{in terms of}} his Welsh identity. Metamorphoses, characteristic of Celticity, and the evolving history and culture of Britain, accounted for his perception of the world as a natural phenomenon in a flux whereby mutuality and mutability oscillate between images and words. Rationale of the chapter: The essay positions David Jones as the leading exponent of uniting word and image. Unlike his fellow imagists, he created a synthesis of image and text, whereas the others’ paintings are largely responses to words which influence particular works, rather than images prompting poetry, as in <b>Jones’s</b> <b>case...</b>|$|R
