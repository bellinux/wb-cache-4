5|$|By {{the evening}} of August20, Bret was {{designated}} a hurricane following reports of 75mph (120km/h) winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission. At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level ridge. The following day, Bret began to undergo rapid intensification, as a well-defined eye developed. On the morning of August22, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a barometric pressure of 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly thereafter, an upper-level trough {{to the west of}} the storm began <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> its cloud pattern.|$|E

40|$|In budding yeast, {{inactivation}} of telomerase and ensuing telomere erosion cause relocalization of telomeres {{to nuclear}} pore complexes (NPCs). However, neither {{the mechanism of}} such relocalization nor its significance are understood. We report that proteins bound <b>to</b> <b>eroded</b> telomeres are recognized by the SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) -targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) Slx 5 -Slx 8 and become increasingly SUMOylated. Recruitment of Slx 5 -Slx 8 <b>to</b> <b>eroded</b> telomeres facilitates telomere relocalization to NPCs and type II telomere recombination, a counterpart of mammalian alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Moreover, artificial tethering of a telomere to a NPC promotes type II telomere recombination but cannot bypass the lack of Slx 5 -Slx 8 in this process. Together, our results indicate that SUMOylation positively contributes to telomere relocalization to the NPC, where poly-SUMOylated proteins that accumulated over time have to be removed. We propose that STUbL-dependent relocalization of telomeres to NPCs constitutes a pathway in which excessively SUMOylated proteins are removed from “congested” intermediates to ensure unconventional recombination...|$|R

5|$|On March 3, 1873, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed a bill re-enfranchising ex-Confederates, {{to the delight of}} much of the state population and the concern of the Minstrels. The legislature called a special election in November to replace 33 members, mostly Minstrels, who had left for patronage jobs in the Baxter government. Baxter refused to let the Minstrels manipulate the election, declaring that free, honest elections would be held during his term. With the help of the newly re-enfranchised voters, conservative Democrats swept the election and gained a small majority in the legislature. Baxter was about <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> his Republican base out from under him.|$|E

5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|The tengu's {{unpleasant}} image continued <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> in the 17th century. Some stories now presented them as {{much less}} malicious, protecting and blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them or setting them on fire.

The tengu's wings and huge nose then reappeared. The tengu requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, but he continued, unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
50|$|The Spit {{was formed}} between 1897 and 1898, {{a product of}} {{longshore}} drift when high seas broke through a small area of land called Jumpinpin on Stradbroke Island.

5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> the dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S. then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.|$|E
5|$|At 12:00UTC on September4, the NHC {{downgraded}} Fred to {{a tropical}} depression as its wind circulation waned; though its winds briefly picked {{back up to}} tropical storm force the next day, Fred continued as a depression with minimal convection throughout the remainder of its existence. Concurrently, a deep-altitude disturbance {{a few hundred miles}} east of Bermuda began <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> the southern edge of the high-pressure ridge that Fred had circumnavigated for most of its journey. This changed the steering pattern in the region, turning the depression abruptly to the north on September6. Over the next hours, Fred became increasingly diffuse because of its progressively worsening surroundings. It officially lost its status as a tropical cyclone at 18:00UTC, degenerating into a trough 1,210mi (1,945km) southwest of the Azores and later merging with a frontal boundary nearby.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Vince's {{impressive}} {{organization was}} very short lived as westerly wind shear began <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> the eye within hours. In response, the storm weakened to {{a tropical storm}} shortly thereafter. A broad low-level trough approached the storm from the northwest, pulling the convection northward as the storm's low-level center accelerated eastward. On 10 October, two brief bursts of convection surprised forecasters, but with the sea surface temperature as low as 22°C (72°F), the flares were not sustained. Vince continued to weaken as it approached the Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical depression on 11 October, shortly before it made landfall near Huelva, Spain. The fast-moving tropical depression quickly dissipated over land. Its remnants moved across southern Spain, dumping rain on the drought-ridden region, and moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante {{in the early hours}} of 12 October.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E
5|$|Hours after {{attaining}} {{its peak}} intensity, Fred began to weaken as clouds {{began to fill}} the eye. By this time, the hurricane was beginning to turn toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened. Continued weakening took place as dry air started <b>to</b> <b>erode</b> convection along {{the southern edge of}} the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased. Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane. By September10, the mid-level circulation center was displaced from the low-level circulation center. On September11, the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. Unrelenting shear and dry air finally took their toll on September12. By that time, no deep convection was associated with the main circulation of Fred, leaving the center fully exposed. The storm degenerated into a remnant-low later that day, corresponding with the final advisory from the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
50|$|The Sugar Loaf Islands, {{along with}} onshore pinnacles such as Paritutu (153 m), {{represent}} the oldest volcanic {{activity on the}} Taranaki peninsula.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) modification of two adhesive systems on long-term bond strength to normal and artificially eroded dentin. A total of 128 extracted human molars were sectioned and the buccal and oral surfaces of each molar were ground until the dentin. One half was left untreated (normal dentin) while the other half underwent artificial erosion. Resin composite was bonded to the buccal or oral surface following treatment with Adper Scotchbond 1 XT or OptiBond FL without or with 1 % BAC incorporation. Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured after 24 [*]h (100 % humidity, 37 °C) or 1 year (tap water, 37 °C). SBS results were statistically analyzed (α = 0. 05). SBS was significantly lower <b>to</b> artificially <b>eroded</b> dentin than <b>to</b> normal dentin (p< 0. 001). Storage for 1 year {{had no effect on}} SBS to normal dentin but led to a significant decrease in SBS <b>to</b> artificially <b>eroded</b> dentin (p< 0. 001). BAC incorporation decreased the 24 [*]h SBS to normal dentin (p= 0. 018), increased the 24 [*]h SBS <b>to</b> <b>eroded</b> dentin (p= 0. 001), and had no effect on the 1 -year SBS for either substrate. Consequently, BAC incorporation did not improve bond durability...|$|R
