The article offers a systematic analysis of factors determining the choice of <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> accounting methods that is based on research by Lithuanian and foreign scientists and hypotheses of the positive accounting theory. The research produced a theoretical result: it identified groups of factors that determine the choice of <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> accounting methods including a flow chart of the factor and accounting method interaction, which can be used to develop a profit increasing or profit decreasing accounting policy. The factors are broken down into factors of the internal and external environment. Financial and human factors are attributable to the internal environment factors, while economic and technological factors are regarded as factors of the external environment. It was found that the financial leverage and the firm value maximization are the key factors in the financial factor group as they affect the management determination to opt for profit increasing <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> accounting methods, while technological factors have an effect on profit decreasing <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> accounting policy choice.

40|$|We study, {{focusing}} {{on real estate}} and other <b>fixed</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> how the heterogeneous effects of real estate prices influence real estate investment behavior. Theoretically, expectations of declining real estate prices not only reduce overall <b>fixed</b> <b>tangible</b> investment through a collateral channel but also reduce real estate investment through intertemporal substitution of demand. By employing a unique dataset on firms’ land transactions and overall investment in Japan during the period 1997 through 2006, we examine these predictions to find the following. First, the entire <b>fixed</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> investment is positively associated with {{the growth rate of}} land prices, which evidences the collateral channel. In contrast, land investment has no statistically significant relationships with land price growth. Second, a decomposition of land investment into land purchases and sales shows that land sales actually decrease when the growth rate of prices falls. Third, large firms and firms that acquired land during and shortly after the bubble period tend to reduce land sales. This is consistent with Geltner’s (2014) argument that potential sellers of land set their reservation prices at their purchase prices and are reluctant to sell land {{in the face of a}} persistent drop in its price. 基盤研究(S) = Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S...|$|R
