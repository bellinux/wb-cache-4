We investigate 3 D object recognition from 2 D features as a typical problem of computer vision. We identify 3 factors which contribute {{to the complexity of}} image data: feature <b>truncation,</b> <b>noise</b> and clutter. We propose a modelling scheme for these factors, which allows us both to measure and to simulate each factor. Using the scheme, a systematic comparison is made between two existing strategies for model-matching as a function of clutter and truncation factors. Post-model-matching object discrimination is then examined {{as a function of the}} noise factor. These two examples serve to illustrate the data complexity model, and demonstrate its use for formal assessment of modelbased algorithms. ...|$|E

Therefore the basis can be used to generate surrogate models relying on regression methods (ARMA, ARIMA processes [9, 10]), time series analysis [11], etc. These resulting models are expected to be easy to use and computationally efficient. The quality of the snapshots depends highly on the initial chosen vectors and the process to generate the model; error criterion could be difficult to exhibit.|$|R

40|$|A large {{literature}} {{exists on}} techniques for extracting probability distributions for future asset prices from option prices. No definitive method {{has been developed}} however. The parametric ‘mixture of normals’, and nonparametric ‘smoothed implied volatility’ methods remain the most widespread approaches.

The accuracy of these formulae is studied {{here for the first}} time. The Black-Scholes formula is used to generate option prices, and error curves for the first 4 moments of the RND are computed using the ‘model-free’ formulae. It is found that, in practice, the formulae are prone to large and economically significant errors, because they contain definite integrals that can only be solved numerically. We show that without mathematically equivalent expressions with analytical solutions the formulae are difficult to deploy effectively in practice...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Traditionally, {{much of the}} {{research}} into estimating the effects of <b>truncation</b> and roundoff <b>noise</b> in fixed-point systems has been focused on the implementation within, or design of, a digital signal processing (DSP) processor. This leads to certain constraints on and assumptions about quantisation errors: for example that the wordlength at all signals in the signal flow graph (SFG) is constant, and that the wordlength before a quantisation is much greater than after (for example after a multiply). When designing custom hardware to implement DSP functions, we may often be freed from these constraints. In this context, we report in this Letter some alternative truncation-noise models that have been developed as part of a high-level synthesis system for the mapping of an SFG to hardware implementation in a field programmable gate array (FPGA). To reduce as much as possible the wastage of FPGA resources, we are specifically interested in the truncation rather than rou...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Different {{mathematical}} {{techniques are}} being developed to reduce the dimensionality of data within large datasets, for robust retrieval of required information. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a modified low rank approximation form of Vector Space Model, {{can be used for}} detecting underlying semantic relationships within text corpora. LSA performs a low-rank approximation on term-document matrix, which is generated by transforming textual data into a vector representation, thereby bringing out the semantic connectedness present among the documents of the corpus. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is the traditional approximation method used for LSA, wherein lower dimensional components from the decomposition are truncated. On <b>truncation,</b> the linguistic <b>noise</b> present in the vector representation is removed, and the semantic connectedness is made visible. One of the pitfalls of using SVD is that the truncated matrix will have negative components, which is not natural for interpreting the textual representation. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) addresses this issue by generating nonnegative parts-based representation as the low rank approximation for performing LSA. The paper provides an in-depth overview of how both methods are being used for the purpose of Information Retrieval. Performance evaluation of the methods has been performed using standard test datasets...|$|R
40|$|Many applications, {{including}} communications, {{test and}} measurement, and radar, require {{the generation of}} signals {{with a high degree}} of spectral purity. One method for producing tunable, low-noise source signals is to combine the outputs of multiple direct digital synthesizers (DDSs) arranged in a parallel conﬁguration. In such an approach, if all noise is uncorrelated across channels, the noise will decrease relative to the combined signal power, resulting in a reduction of sideband noise and an increase in SNR. However, in any real array, the broadband noise and spurious components will be correlated to some degree, limiting the gains achieved by parallelization. This thesis examines the potential performance beneﬁts that may arise from using an array of DDSs, with a focus on several types of common DDS errors, including phase <b>noise,</b> phase <b>truncation</b> spurs, quantization <b>noise</b> spurs, and quantizer nonlinearity spurs. Measurements to determine the level of correlation among DDS channels were made on a custom 14 -channel DDS testbed. The investigation of the phase noise of a DDS array indicates that the contribution to the phase noise from the DACs can be decreased to a desired level by using a large enough number of channels. In such a system, the phase noise qualities of the source clock and the system cost and complexity will be the main limitations on the phase noise of the DDS array. The study of phase truncation spurs suggests that, at least in our system, the phase truncation spurs are uncorrelated, contrary to the theoretical prediction. We believe this decorrelation is due to the existence of an unidentiﬁed mechanism in our DDS array that is unaccounted for in our current operational DDS model. This mechanism, likely due to some timing element in the FPGA, causes some randomness in the relative phases of the truncation spurs from channel to channel each time the DDS array is powered up. This randomness decorrelates the phase truncation spurs, opening the potential for SFDR gain from using a DDS array. The analysis of the correlation of quantization noise spurs in an array of DDSs shows that the total quantization noise power of each DDS channel is uncorrelated for nearly all values of DAC output bits. This suggests that a near N gain in SQNR is possible for an N-channel array of DDSs. This gain will be most apparent for low-bit DACs in which quantization noise is notably higher than the thermal noise contribution. Lastly, the measurements of the correlation of quantizer nonlinearity spurs demonstrate that the second and third harmonics are highly correlated across channels for all frequencies tested. This means that there is no beneﬁt to using an array of DDSs for the problems of in-band quantizer nonlinearities. As a result, alternate methods of harmonic spur management must be employed...|$|R
40|$|In {{urban traffic}} networks, delays at signal-controlled {{interactions}} are a main {{component of the}} travel time experienced by road users. Effective optimization of traffic signal control offers high opportunities to reduce delays and overall to improve traffic operations. A strategic network traffic signal control policy, also called anticipatory network traffic control, determines signal timings to optimize network-wide objectives, e. g. minimize network travel times. While optimizing control variables, anticipatory traffic control explicitly takes into account road users’ route choice responses and the resulting network flow patterns. A traffic assignment model is usually used for approximating this route choice response. The basic problem in implementing anticipatory network control in a real-life system is that: due to the inherent model-reality mismatch of this approximated response model, the true resulting traffic pattern will in general not be optimal; signal control using incorrect anticipation might even trigger undesired traffic conditions, for instance unexpected delays, traffic congestion and spillback. Hence, since a model will unavoidably represent a coarse approximation of reality, {{there is a need}} for introducing corrective measures to deal with the model-reality mismatch and in turn achieve an effective control. The general aim of this PhD research is to develop control methods that elevate the traffic system to its best achievable performance, by explicitly addressing the model-reality mismatch. We take advantage of the fact that routine traffic patterns repeat from day to day, allowing one to learn from observing the true traffic patterns, resulting from a response to control, to compensate for errors in the response model. The solution method is initially inspired from industrial applications in robot manipulator, which have a similar objective, i. e improving performance of unknown / uncertain systems that operate repeatedly. A rule-based Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is applied to the traffic signal setting. The operational signal timings are iteratively corrected to achieve the predefined desired traffic state. The basic idea behind the iterative learning approach is to learn from the errors between observations and the desired reference. Following this basic idea of learning from observed errors, an optimization-based iterative learning approach is elaborated in the anticipatory control context. By making use of the traffic assignment model, the desired state is no longer predefined, but rather endogenously optimized. A method of Iterative Optimizing Control with Model Bias Correction (IOCMBC) is then proposed. IOCMBC generates a sequence of control settings based on a first-order model bias correction. Control performance is improved by learning from the model bias between real measurements and model predictions. It is proven that IOCMBC has two desirable properties: convergence in real traffic operations, and consistency between the convergent point and the real optimum. An integrated framework is then presented to jointly perform IOCMBC and model parameter estimation. The objective is to complete the iterative optimizing control scheme in which the underlying network flow modeling is imperfectly calibrated. Two objectives are fulfilled by this integrated framework, i. e. better control for the real system, and better model calibration. This integrated approach is advantageous to applications in which the underlying model is not only used for designing optimal control, but also for supporting other traffic management measures, for instance traffic information or route guidance. In order to link the methodology to general network applications, the key algorithmic implementation issue regarding the calculation of flow sensitivity is later addressed. We present a method to estimate the derivative of real flows with respect to signal control variables; this derivative information is particularly important in choosing directions to improve control optimization objectives. The derivative estimation method obviates the need to explicitly explore sensitivity by adding perturbations on each individual control variable, and hence allows for multiple control variables. By an evaluation on the derivative estimation, two types of estimation errors are revealed, i. e. <b>truncation</b> error and <b>noise</b> error. The presence of measurement noise is particularly detrimental to the estimation, which ultimately affects the quality of control solutions. A reliable dual method, i. e. dual IOCMBC is then proposed, improving both optimization objective and derivative estimation during the control process. Dual IOCMBC is able to generate a control sequence that converges to the real optimal point, and meanwhile forms a basis for estimation of the real flow derivatives. Numerical experiments on a general midsize network present an important intermediate step towards field implementations. status: publishe...|$|R
