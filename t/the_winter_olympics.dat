5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> {{was created}} to feature snow and ice sports that were logistically {{impossible}} to hold during the Summer Games. Figure skating (in 1908 and 1920) and ice hockey (in 1920) were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics. The IOC desired to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities. At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne, {{it was decided to}} hold a winter version of the Olympic Games. A winter sports week (it was actually 11days) was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France, in connection with the Paris Games held three months later; this event became the first Winter Olympic Games. Although it was intended that the same country host both the Winter and Summer Games in a given year, this idea was quickly abandoned. The IOC mandated that the Winter Games be celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart. This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> <b>Olympics</b> were held every four years, two years after each Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The first Winter Olympics {{took place}} in 1924.
