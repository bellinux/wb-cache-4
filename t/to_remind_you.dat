25|$|Before {{releasing}} the jury for deliberation, Judge Learned Hand altered {{the charges against}} the defendants and attempted to preface the jury of their constitutional duties. Hand dismissed all the charges against Josephine Bell, and dismissed the first count – “conspiracy to cause mutiny and refusal of duty”—against the remaining defendants. Prior to {{releasing the}} jurors, Judge Hand stated, “I do not have <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that every man {{has the right to}} have such economic, philosophic or religious opinions as seem to him best, whether they be socialist, anarchistic or atheistic.” After deliberating from Thursday afternoon to Saturday, the jury returned with two decisions. First, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the jurors seeking to convict the defendants blamed one juror for being unable to conform to the majority opinion, as he was also a socialist and, consequently, un-American. Not only did the other eleven jurors demand the prosecutor to levy charges against the lone juror) but moved to drag the socialist supporter out into the street and lynch him. Judge Hand, given the uproar, declared a mistrial.|$|E

The artist joked, [...] "there are grey landscapes <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> about why you stay indoors in Nova Scotia to read" [...] and said that portraits of staff at the Spring Garden Road and Halifax North Memorial libraries, photographed by Mary Ann Archibald, were painted and had subsequently been recognized by some of their subjects. He also stated that the library commission is the biggest installation he has done to date.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E

"Nay, now, Luis, thou emboldenest me <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>thee</b> that I {{expressed}} a wish that thou wouldst {{not go on}} thy last voyage to the north, and yet thou didst depart! I felt that it would displease Doña Beatriz; thy truant disposition having made her uneasy lest thou shouldst get altogether into the habits of a rover, and into disfavor with the queen." ...|$|R

500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{called it}} [...] "metaphorically ambivalent". Barbara Jaeger of The Bergen Record called Clayton's bassline [...] "ominous". Stokes {{described}} it as [...] "the antithesis of [...] bright, ringing, optimistic, inspirational selves, it was dirty, loud, discordant, repetitive, noisy, black. If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad, then it was effective". Graham said [...] "'Exit' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the nice guys of rock. Never had they shown such a vicious streak or produced such a withering track.... Far more than even 'Bullet the Blue Sky', [...] playing is scratching at the prison bars of polished good taste", describing it as the wild card of the album. Author John Luerssen contrasted it {{to the rest of}} the band's catalogue, saying [...] "Unlike most of the songs U2 had written up to this point, 'Exit' lacked any optimism." [...] Hot Press contributor Colm O'Hare felt the claims by Bardo evoked memories of Charles Manson's use of [...] "Helter Skelter", and contained [...] "even more sinister shades" [...] of the death of John Lennon. In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond argued it was [...] "awkward enough <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Angelakos {{said it was}} a {{great honor}} to attend the Ventry {{ceremony}} 70 years after the incident: [...] "I would like <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of the magnanimous stance of Werner Lott, the commander of the U-35." [...] The occurrence is one of only two such instances in World War II, where a German submarine crew risked its own safety to protect the crew of a vessel they torpedoed and sank.|$|E
2500|$|As vice {{chairman}} of the Revolutionary Command Council, al-Douri was involved in the wars against Iran and Kuwait. During the 1988–1989 Al-Anfal Campaign, al-Douri was said to have ordered Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka 'Chemical Ali') to use Mustard and Sarin nerve gas on Kurdish fighters in Halabja. He was complicit in the invasion of Saudi Arabia and the attack on the town of Khafji in January 1991. During the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, he was involved in the suppression of the revolt led by the Iraqi marsh Arabs.

2500|$|In 2009, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey {{reviewed}} the NES game in 1UP.com's official Retro Gaming Blog. He wrote {{that it had}} the same problems that Bart vs. the Space Mutants had, such as [...] "lousy jumping physics", and that it [...] "also manages to strip away the novelty that made the original Simpsons NES game worth checking {{out in the first}} place. The sequel is a straight-up, cookie-cutter platformer without any real Simpson-y touches to satisfy fans of the show; Bart finds himself wandering through generic side-scrolling levels, with a Simpsons character showing up every now and then <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that this is an actual licensed product and not just a ROM hack." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2011, FAO and {{its members}} {{countries}} officially recognized global freedom from the deadly cattle virus. On this day, the FAO Conference, the highest body of the UN agency, adopted a resolution declaring the eradication of rinderpest. The resolution also called on the world community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and vaccines be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for disease surveillance and reporting be applied. [...] "While we are celebrating {{one of the greatest}} successes for FAO and its partners, I wish <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that this extraordinary achievement {{would not have been possible}} without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments, the main organizations in Africa, Asia and Europe, and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions", FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf commented.|$|E
2500|$|Ed Power (The Independent) {{provided}} {{the group with}} a positive review stating, [...] "Backstreet also deserve credit for not over-indulging in the customary patronising patter you get from most pop acts. Instead of repetitive shout outs of, [...] "how you doing Dublin", the Boys simply churn out hit after hit without pausing for breath. Sure, they haven't re-invented the wheel musically, yet they prove in style that they've already left a considerable legacy of entertainment." [...] Vicki Kellaway (Liverpool Echo) gave the band a 10 out 10 remarking, [...] "They are utterly shameless. You might think four men {{with an average age}} of 32 (I’m sorry <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of that) would feel they are beyond the baggy jeans, printed hoodies, huge trainers and exaggerated ‘running man’ dance moves. Oh no. You might as well give a crowd what they want. This was not one of those we’ll-hit-you-with-our-new-material and throw in a medley for fun. It was pure nostalgia." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to hang in there and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through." ...|$|E

[...] Furthermore, Cross wrote that [...] "as you listen to Love Come to Life, {{it is easy to}} see Big Daddy Weave garners their lyrical content from life experiences.
