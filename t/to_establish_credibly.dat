2500|$|Kirby {{recalled}} events somewhat differently. Challenged with Lee's {{version of}} events in a 1990 interview, Kirby responded: [...] "I would say that's an outright lie", although the interviewer, Gary Groth notes that this statement needs to be viewed with caution. Kirby claims {{he came up with}} the idea for the Fantastic Four in Marvel's offices, and that Lee had merely added the dialogue after the story had been pencilled. Kirby also sought <b>to</b> <b>establish,</b> more <b>credibly</b> and on numerous occasions, that the visual elements of the strip were his conceptions. He regularly pointed to a team he had created for rival publisher DC Comics in the 1950s, the Challengers of the Unknown. [...] "f you notice the uniforms, they're the same... I always give them a skintight uniform with a belt... the Challengers and the FF have a minimum of decoration. And of course, the Thing's skin is a kind of decoration, breaking up the monotony of the blue uniform." [...] The chest insignia of a [...] "4" [...] within a circle, however, was designed by Lee. The characters wear no uniforms in the first two issues.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} litigation in which some defendants have insufficient assets to pay a judgment at trial. Because the defendant’s assets are not observable, this serves {{as a source of}} asymmetric information which leads to trials in the equilibrium of the model. Unlike many other types of informational asymmetry, the defendant’s assets are not generally subject to discovery and it may be difficult <b>to</b> <b>credibly</b> <b>establish</b> a lack of assets in a voluntary disclosure. Thus, this is a source of asymmetry between the parties which is likely to persist in the presence of these institutions. This suggests that this particular asymmetry is a potentially important explanation for settlement failure, at least in a subset of cases. We describe three possible equilibria in the model with asset constrained defendants. One equilibrium is consistent with high dispute rates between the plaintiff and defendant. The model suggests that fee shifting will either have no effect on the incidence of trial or will increase it...|$|R

These two would subsequently meet {{for the first time}} March 17 in the 1 mile San Felipe Handicap, with Linda's Chief taking the win and Sham, the slight favorite, finishing fourth.|$|R
