5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough {{force on the}} ground <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened. Traffic was eventually able to use this route by nightfall, and the surviving tanks of the 743rd tank battalion spent the night near Vierville.|$|E
5|$|Shakshuka, a North-African (Tunisian) dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, is a {{national}} favorite, especially in the winter. It is traditionally served up in a cast iron pan with bread <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the sauce. Some variations of the dish are cooked with liberal use of ingredients such as eggplant, chili peppers, hot paprika, spinach, feta cheese or safed cheese.|$|E
5|$|Shakshouka, {{originally}} a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically {{served in the}} same frying pan {{in which it is}} cooked, with thick slices of white bread <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with spinach and feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 August, interagency fire {{management}} team {{announced that the}} fire was 100 percent contained. To accomplish this, approximately 270 mi of fire line had been built by ground crews and bulldozers. A large number of firefighters remained on scene <b>to</b> conduct <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> operations. All the remaining evacuation orders were lifted in both Oregon and California, but residents were warned that smoke would persist in the area until all the fuel inside the fire line had finished burning. Forest Service recreation sites, roads, and trails remained closed due <b>to</b> fire <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> activities.|$|R

50|$|After holding {{administrative}} {{posts in}} London, he was despatched to the Kingdom of Ireland in June 1798 after the Irish Rebellion broke out. In addition <b>to</b> <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> {{most of the}} remnants of the rebellion, Cornwallis was instrumental in convincing the Irish Parliament to pass the Act of Union (1800). This was a critical step in uniting the British and Irish crowns, creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Cornwallis resigned his posts in Ireland in 1801 after King George refused to support Catholic emancipation.|$|R
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Until 17 July, the VRS {{continued}} its attacks aimed at retaking territory lost in Operation Tiger, gradually pushing the HV back towards Dubrovnik. On 23 July, the HV 1st Guards Brigade counter-attacked north of Zaton, pushing the VRS {{north and east}} towards Popovo field. The attack, codenamed Operation Liberated Land (Croatian: Operacija Oslobođena zemlja), failed to cut off a battalion of the VRS 472nd Motorized Brigade deployed to Bobani, and the 4th Guards Brigade had to be deployed <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the area. Although substantial parts of the territory gained during the attack were surrendered to the VRS, the operation strengthened the HV defences in the area by 8 August.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} {{under the}} command of Major F.P. Chuvakin from the 2nd Brigade composed of 45 tanks, 37 of which were from the brigade and the remaining eight from the KMG, and a machine gun and rifle battalion, was attached to the KMG <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> remaining Polish resistance in the Augustów Forest and to prevent them from fleeing to Lithuania. On 22 September, in the area of Sapotskin, the detachment engaged units of the Polish 101st and 102nd Uhlan Regiments, as well as the 110th Reserve Uhlan Regiment, and other units retreating from Grodno. Most of the Polish troops escaped into the forest because of the slow advance of the detachment. Around three companies of Polish troops were dispersed and several officers were killed, among them the Grodno defense commander, Józef Olszyna-Wilczyński. The retreating Polish forces left mines behind them, which blew up four BT-7 tanks. Chuvakin's troops also lost 11 killed and 14 wounded.|$|E

50|$|In May, 9 Squadron {{was moved}} to Comilla after a brief spell of {{tactical}} reconnaissance duties supporting the battles of Imphal and Kohima. During August 1944, the two squadrons carried out intensive bombing of Japanese positions in the Sangu River valley, specially for three consecutive days in Labawa to support an offensive by 81 Division to expel the Japanese from the area. By the end of December 1944, 10 Squadron had also been moved into the operational area at Ramu. With the fall of Rangoon on 3 May 1945, the operations in Burma were reduced <b>to</b> <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> of small pockets of resistance. By the end of June most of the Royal Air forces squadrons were withdrawn, leaving only 8 Squadron {{to assist in the}} <b>mopping</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

Elbryan and Pony, along with the small group of fighters they've formed, commence <b>to</b> <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> the demon's army as best they can. Soon, though, they discover that their friend Bradwarden, who they thought was dead, is still alive and in the clutches of the Church. Furthermore, the Chilichunks, Pony's adopted family, have also been captured as a means to lure Pony out so that Markwart can take back the Ring Stones stolen by Avelyn.|$|R
5|$|Although not {{initially}} agreeing {{to send troops}} to Borneo in the opening stages of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, the Australian government did allow its forces stationed in Malaysia {{as part of the}} Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR) to be used to protect Peninsular Malaysia from Indonesian attack. 3 RAR, which was based at Camp Terendak in Malacca, was subsequently used <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> two small airborne and seaborne landings near Labis and Pontian in September and October 1964. These incursions suggested that a major escalation in the conflict was imminent, and in January 1965 the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests, subsequently agreeing to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo, in addition to a battery of artillery, an engineer construction squadron, and a squadron from the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle was {{captured}} by a Royalist unit in 1643, following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west. The castle was taken without a fight by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside. Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644, but they failed {{to take back the}} castle. By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west, and on 15 September they reached the castle. Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms, and Sir Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle. As a result of this process, the castle escaped being slighted, or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament, unlike many other castles in the region, such as Nunney.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} keep up {{pressure}} on the whole front, the 19th Indian Brigade was ordered to attack Villa Grande and exploit any gains {{as far as the}} Arielli river which ran from the mountains through Tollo to the Adriatic. The attack went in at 05:30 on 22 December but failed in desperate fighting. The 1/5th Battalion, Essex Regiment renewed their attack the following morning with more success. After a counterattack by German paratroops had been repulsed at midday, the Essex advanced <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the remainder of the village. However, deadly small scale house-to-house battles continued throughout the rest of 23 December and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on. To the south of Villa Grande, the 3rd/15th Punjabis had taken Vezzano on 23 December and a continuous brigade line had been established.|$|E
50|$|The {{story of}} the {{previous}} game repeated itself, as Nebraska was out in front with an adequate lead when Cornhusker reserves entered the game <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> things <b>up,</b> which allowed Iowa State to put up 13 points for their game total, merely tying Nebraska's 3rd quarter output.|$|R
50|$|In {{the morning}} of 14 April forward {{elements}} of 38th Brigade had crossed the bridge over the Reno at Bastia but had been forced back by an armoured counterattack. It was decided to confine immediate activity <b>to</b> <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> south of the Reno and await the approach of 167th Brigade which, advancing on both banks of the Reno, would shortly threaten the flank of the defenders north of the river in Bastia and oblige them to retire. Rather than wait for the bridge at Bastia to be cleared, V Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Charles Keightley ordered 78th Division's 11th Infantry Brigade to use 56th Division's bridges over the Reno {{in order to get}} forward towards Argenta without delay.|$|R
50|$|Stafford arrived off the Hagushi beaches on 17 June {{and moved}} into the {{anchorage}} at Kerama Retto the next day. Her arrival at Okinawa came very {{near the end of}} the struggle for that island. On 19 June, organized resistance on the island ceased, and operations were confined <b>to</b> <b>mopping</b> <b>up</b> the remnants of the Japanese defense force. With their loss of Okinawa, the Japanese concentrated upon readying planes and pilots for the expected invasion of the home islands. Consequently, Stafford suffered no kamikaze attacks during her tour of duty in the Ryukyus. She served on antisubmarine screen station, and her only scrape with the enemy occurred on 27 July when she evaded an airdropped torpedo.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line. The first wave of German attackers was beaten back with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in order to take the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Infantry Brigade now began <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the area. On 18 February, the 35th Infantry Battalion {{attacked}} a Japanese force near Gabutamon, killing 40. Finding {{a force of}} about 100 Japanese at nearby Tapen, they attacked, killing another 52 Japanese {{for the loss of}} one man wounded, while the Papuans on their flanks killed another 51, of whom 43 were accounted for by Corporal Bengari and two other Papuans. The next day, the Papuans found and killed another 39 Japanese in the vicinity. At Tapen, the Australians and Papuans also found evidence that the Japanese had resorted to cannibalism. In the period of 20 January – 1 March 1944, 734 Japanese were killed, 1,775 found dead and 48 were captured. Australian casualties came to four killed and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|While Charles Theodore's {{dream of}} a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph {{continued}} on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow—Max Joseph's widow or the mother-in-law or both—petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick's envoys to the heir presumptive convinced this slighted prince to lodge protests with the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Joseph's troops remained in portions of Bavaria, even establishing an Austrian administration at Straubing, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. Austrian occupation of Bavaria was unacceptable to Charles August's champion, Frederick. Prussian troops mobilized near Prussia's border with Bohemia, reminiscent of the invasion in 1740 that so endangered Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg hereditary lands. Meanwhile, the French wriggled out of their diplomatic obligations to Austria, telling Joseph {{that there would be}} no military support from Paris for a war against Prussia. Britain, Prussia's strongest ally, was already mired in a war in North America, but Prussia's military had recovered from the Seven Years' War and Frederick did not require any help. Prussia's other ally, Saxony, aligned by two marriages with Charles August, was strategically prepared for war against Austria and ready to contribute twenty thousand troops. Watching from St. Petersburg, Catherine II was willing <b>to</b> <b>mop</b> <b>up</b> the spoils of war for the Russian Empire but did not want to get involved in another costly European conflict.|$|E

25|$|From unit 6, 1.3cubicmeters {{of water}} from the spent fuel pool leaked from the pool, and flowed into through a {{drainage}} pipe, ultimately into the Sea of Japan. The water contained 80Bq/L, totaling 90,000Bq in the release. For comparison, an Onsen located in Misasa, Tottori, Japan uses water with a large concentration of radon, which gives it a radioactivity of 9300Bq/L.
