5|$|Florence {{produced}} wind {{gusts of}} up to 115mph (185km/h) on Bermuda, which caused several power outages and minor damage. Florence <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> heavy rains across Newfoundland as an extratropical storm, destroying one house and causing minor damage to several others. There were no fatalities {{as a result of}} the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar {{contracted}} pneumonia {{during his}} {{stay in the}} hotel, which led to his demise {{on the evening of}} 4 June 1895. His body was <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> back to Johor by an English man-of-war from Penang. A state funeral was given to Abu Bakar, and he was laid to rest at the royal mausoleum at Makam Mahmoodiah on 7 September 1895. His son, Tunku Ibrahim was later installed as the Sultan of Johor in November 1895.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{trick was}} to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.|$|E

5|$|Both ships had {{suffered}} damage, with the injuries to Astraeas masts requiring urgent repairs while Gloire had also suffered damage to its rigging and sails. The French ship had also taken heavy casualties, with 40 men killed or wounded, including the captain. In contrast, Astraea had not lost a single man, although {{one of the}} eight wounded subsequently died. Paulet effected repairs to both ships and gave temporary command of Gloire to Lieutenant John Talbot, who was subsequently promoted. He <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> both ships to the Portsmouth, where Colpoys was reconstituting his scattered squadron.|$|E
5|$|From {{his newly}} {{established}} command post, {{in the trenches}} on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge, Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken. Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition, the explosives had not been attached. Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the code words 'Ham' and 'Jam' <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> Fox's platoon across the canal bridge, positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company's forward platoon.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November 2005, Paulus won {{an unjust}} {{detention}} {{action against the}} Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract. The elder Van der Sloot <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of 40,000 Aruban florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses. In January 2007, Paulus found work as a managing partner at the law firm that represented him.|$|E

5|$|The Party Play mode was {{inspired}} by recognizing that past Guitar Hero games {{made it difficult to}} jump into without maneuvering through a number of menus and selection screens. The mode was designed to be used at social gatherings, and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers that players already had available, thus allowing for various other combinations beyond the standard four-person band. This aspect of the game was <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> to the other band modes to allow the game to remain flexible.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} five {{competing}} theories about the manuscript's place of origin and time of completion. First, the book, or perhaps just the text, may have been created at Iona, <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> to Kells, where the illuminations were perhaps added, and never finished. Second, the book may have been produced entirely at Iona. Third, the manuscript may have been produced entirely in the scriptorium at Kells. Fourth, {{it may have been}} produced in the north of England, perhaps at Lindisfarne, <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> to Iona and from there to Kells. Finally, {{it may have been the}} product of an unknown monastery in Pictish Scotland, though there is no actual evidence for this theory, especially considering the absence of any surviving manuscript from Pictland. Although the question of the exact location of the book's production will probably never be answered conclusively, the first theory, that it was begun at Iona and continued at Kells, is widely accepted. Regardless of which theory is true, it is certain that the Book of Kells was produced by Columban monks closely associated with the community at Iona.|$|E
5|$|Thorne <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> suit {{in federal}} court to {{overturn}} the discharge; the court ordered his reinstatement while the case proceeded. After he lost his challenge to DADT in both U.S. District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal on October 19, 1998, and he was again discharged.|$|E
5|$|When Press Your Luck {{returned}} after the weekend break, the episode {{started with the}} same freeze frame image. Tomarken (again chroma keyed over the image) <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> the viewers {{up to speed on}} what Friday's episode entailed, first by introducing Larson's opponents and then explaining what Larson had done so far, before the game resumed. Freeze frames were also used to lead {{into and out of the}} first two commercial breaks, with voice overs by Tomarken leading into and out of them.|$|E

5|$|After {{hearing of}} Scully collapsing, Mulder {{arrives at the}} {{hospital}} where Scully is being treated. Before {{he is able to}} make contact with her, he is detained by Skinner and two FBI agents. Mulder is <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> to Blevins and a senior agent who demands information on why Scully lied about Mulder's death. After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking Man has a meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side if he is given a good reason to do so.|$|E
5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy, against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E
5|$|Brought {{to the bar}} {{next was}} Henry Benson, a farmer who was out on bail, charged with inciting to riot. Benson was held in surety for £400 plus two other sureties for £200 each. He was to appear for trial at the next assizes. Richard Cooper the elder and Richard Cooper the younger were also bound over to the next assizes. Father and son, William Beamiss the elder and the younger, were <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> in and charged with assaulting and {{stealing}} from Robert Cheesewright the younger, of Littleport, in the Isle of Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Mr Burrough summed up and the jury gave their guilty verdict to both prisoners shortly after.|$|E

5|$|Dreyer {{shot and}} edited {{the film in}} France and <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> it to Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11. Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, {{and they were going to}} use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the fighting around Finschhafen and the defeat of the Japanese counterattack, the Allies began preparing for a concerted assault on the Japanese main defensive position around Sattelberg. In the wake of the Japanese counterattack, the members of the Australian and American staff began working more closely together and reinforcements were quickly approved {{in the form of the}} 26th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier David Whitehead, as well as a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion– whose presence the Australians sought to keep secret for as long as possible– which were landed at Langemak Bay. Supplies were landed by US troops from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, and <b>then</b> <b>brought</b> up and cached around Jivevaneng and Kumawa, but heavy rain hampered the Australian efforts until mid-November.|$|E
