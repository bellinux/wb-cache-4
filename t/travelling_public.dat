5|$|In February 1987, Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined No.33 Squadron (flying Boeing 707 tanker-transports) {{as part of}} a re-formed No.86 Wing {{under the}} newly {{established}} Air Lift Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville to Norfolk Island during Operation Morris Dance, the Australian Defence Force's response to the first of the 1987 Fijian coups; the soldiers subsequently embarked onto RAN warships by helicopter. In 1988, No.37 Squadron's Hercules achieved 200,000accident-free flying hours. No.36 Squadron achieved 100,000accident-free flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Members of the <b>travelling</b> <b>public</b> experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government employed the C-130s and 707s for transport during the pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; the resulting spike in operational hours necessitated No.486 Squadron sending detachments to several locations throughout the country to cope with increased maintenance demands. By the late 1980s, some C-130 maintenance tasks had been outsourced to commercial firms, and Air New Zealand won a four-year depot maintenance contract in 1990.|$|E

From 1902, trains collected passengers from, and delivered passengers to, ferries berthed at this wharf. The ferries were operated by the Union Steam Ship Company until 1974, at which point the Ministry of Transport took over the operation until the service was cancelled in 1976.|$|E
25|$|During 1995, British Airways {{decided to}} exit the short- to medium-haul package holiday market; accordingly, the airline sold Caledonian Airways to British-based tour {{operator}} Inspirations, which was then {{a part of the}} American-owned Carlson group, along with the firm's core fleet of five Tristars. Following Caledonian's sale to Inspirations, the Boeing 757s were returned to British Airways. During 1999, Inspirations became part of the Thomas Cook group when Caledonian Airways was merged with the Flying Colours airline to form JMC Air Services, which in turn became the British arm of the present day Thomas Cook Airlines. Following Inspirations' takeover by Thomas Cook, the remaining former Caledonian Airways Tristars were withdrawn from service as these had suffered increasing and widely publicised reliability problems which had resulted in a generally poor perception of Caledonian amongst the <b>travelling</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E

25|$|National Express West Midlands {{is part of}} the Safer Travel Partnership, {{created in}} 2005 its members also include Centro (responsible for bus, train and tram {{transport}} in the West Midlands) and West Midlands Police. The partnership is committed to reducing crime and anti-social behaviour across the West Midlands bus network whilst providing reassurance to the <b>travelling</b> <b>public.</b> The partnership achieves this through a variety of tactics including Gateway Operations. These operations are intelligence led and are based on the established link between those who evade paying their fare and those responsible for crime, disorder and anti social behaviour. The operation involves partners including NX Revenue Inspectors and Police Officers and Police Community Support Officers from the dedicated Safer Travel Police Team. The activities of the partnership have resulted in very significant reductions in recorded crime across the West Midlands bus network.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{were made}} to {{regularise}} the financial position of the company, but it was unable to escape from its difficulty and went into receivership {{for a second time}} in 1889. By then it had become obvious that continuing inaction was impossible, and discussion had taken place with the Great Western Railway with a view to the larger company buying the Wye Valley concern. The unsatisfactory situation dragged on, and finally in December 1904 the sale was agreed. The GWR was to pay 2.5% of face value on ordinary shares, and 12.5% on preference shares. Ordinary shareholders had thus lost nearly all their money. The sale took formal effect on 1 July 1905. As the GWR had been working the line from the beginning, there was no obvious outward change so far as the <b>travelling</b> <b>public</b> were concerned.|$|E

Tharoor's explanation that [...] "cattle class" [...] was a well-established phrase for economy class travel, and that it attacked the airlines and not the passengers, was ignored in the outcry.

On 8 August 1898, the company opened the Waterloo & City line, a deep level underground railway that ran directly between Waterloo and Bank–Monument station in the City. This gave the company the direct commuter service it had long desired (albeit {{with the need to}} change from surface to underground lines at Waterloo).

The monitoring {{was carried out in}} summer and winter at four of the buildings. A {{survey of the}} <b>travelling</b> <b>public’s</b> perceptions, by questionnaire, was carried out alongside the physical surveys.

Introduction and Background The recent emphasis on encouraging the general public to make better use of public transport has highlighted the quality of the services involved. The environment within public transport buildings (terminals, airports, ports, stations, waiting areas, ticket offices, staff and administration buildings, depots etc) is also therefore put under the spot light.
