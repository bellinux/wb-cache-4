5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} coast of Scotland, the Cailleach ushers in winter by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: féileadh mòr) in the Gulf of Corryvreckan (Gaelic: Coire Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid'). This process is said to take three days, during which <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming tempest is heard as far away as twenty miles (32km) inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E

50|$|About 7.30 one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{soldiers}} reported: “there {{began the}} biggest bombardment I have ever heard—our big guns roared out. I thought hell had been let loose. I {{tried to look}} before me, but could see nothing but flame and smoke, and <b>the</b> <b>roars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big guns were terrible. In about an hour's time our Colonel gave us the word to fix bayonets and charge for the German trenches.|$|R

25|$|At 08:35 on 24 November, {{the seven}} battalions of the {{artillery}} group {{opened fire on}} the Japanese positions {{in front of the}} 3rd Marine Regiment. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cannon fire and the sharp blasts of the explosions in the jungle ahead merged into a near-deafening thunder for more than 20 minutes, with more than 5,600 shells from 75mm and 105mm howitzers fired at the Japanese positions. Smoke shells were also fired into the hills east of the Torokina River to reduce the ability of the Japanese to observe the Marine positions.|$|E
25|$|The final {{orders for}} the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first {{formations}} were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, that something was going on.|$|E
25|$|The Romans finally {{captured}} the Antonia Fortress {{and began a}} frontal assault on {{the gates of the}} Temple. Titus was apparently bent on ending Judaism as a religion. He sought to slaughter their animals, kill their men, rape their women, enslave their children, and kill their God. When he finally did breach the walls, his soldiers set upon everyone – man, woman, child, those who stayed loyal to Rome, and those who did not. The city went up in flames. <b>The</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferno mixed with screams of agony as the Romans swept through the upper and lower city, literally clambering over dead bodies in pursuit of the rebels, until they reached the Temple, set it aflame, and reduced it to dust. When the fires subsided, Titus gave the order to destroy the remainder of the city, seeking that no one would remember the name Jerusalem. The Temple was demolished, after which Titus' soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{high on a}} crag jutting {{over the}} river just above the cataract, she saw him! Her lost lover had not forgotten. Even above <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water she heard him call her name. She stood in the canoe, waved her arms and screamed for help. Though he knew his chances of saving his beloved were slim at best, the young Englishman did not {{hesitate}} for a moment. He leaped from the overhanging bluff and plunged into the whitened water, just as Lillinonah's canoe struck a rock {{in the middle of}} the river and capsized, spilling her into the frothy current. Swiftly as he could, he swam to her side and clasped her body to him. Alas, neither realized that it was already too late. Still wrapped in loving embrace, the doomed pair disappeared into the boiling falls and were crushed to death as they were hurled to the rocks in the broad pool below.|$|E
25|$|Stoney Creek Bridge (originally bridge number 26, now bridge 30), {{in front}} of Stoney Creek Falls, is built on a 4 chain (80m) radius curve and was {{designed}} by the government engineer John Gwynneth. The design is unique in Queensland, the curve being {{the only way to}} avoid tunnelling. By the end of 1887 the concrete foundations on which the wrought iron trestles (Phoenix columns) were erected were well underway. It is one of only two Queensland railway bridges constructed with wrought iron trestles, the other being Christmas Creek Bridge, further up the line. A visit to Cairns by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Henry Wylie Norman, in April 1890 was taken as an opportunity to inspect the construction works. A marquee, covering a banquet table and open to the waterfall, had been set up on the almost completed Stoney Creek Bridge with planks laid over the sleepers. There were no speeches due to <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waterfall immediately behind the bridge. The bridge passed load testing on 30 June 1890.|$|E

5|$|Churring: <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this sound}} {{is similar to}} that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered <b>the</b> chirp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheetah as similar to <b>the</b> soft <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lion, and its churr as <b>the</b> latter's loud <b>roar.</b> <b>The</b> churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp.

500|$|The {{operation}} of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a [...] "regular grunting sound" [...] simulating <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.|$|E

500|$|Although Time {{magazine}} named Rowling as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year award, {{noting the}} social, moral, and political inspiration {{she has given}} her fandom, cultural comments on the series have been mixed. Washington Post book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that {{the large numbers of}} adults reading the Potter series but few other books may represent a [...] "bad case of cultural infantilism", and that the straightforward [...] "good vs. evil" [...] theme of the series is [...] "childish". He also argued [...] "through no fault of Rowling's", the cultural and marketing [...] "hysteria" [...] marked by the publication of the later books [...] "trains children and adults to expect <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide".|$|E
500|$|At 05:29:21 MWT (± 2 seconds), {{the device}} {{exploded}} with an energy equivalent to around [...] The desert sand, largely made of silica, melted {{and became a}} mildly radioactive light green glass, which was named trinitite.

500|$|Gary Gygax {{was born}} in Chicago, the son of Almina Emelie [...] "Posey" [...] (Burdick) and Swiss {{immigrant}} and former Chicago Symphony Orchestra violinist Ernst Gygax. He was named Ernest after his father, but he was commonly known as Gary, the middle name {{given to him by}} his mother after the actor Gary Cooper. The family lived on Kenmore Avenue, close enough to Wrigley Field that he could hear <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowds watching the Chicago Cubs play. At age 7, he became a member {{of a small group of}} friends who called themselves the [...] "Kenmore Pirates". In 1946, after the Kenmore Pirates were involved in a fracas with another gang of boys, his father decided to move the family to Posey's family home in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where Posey's family had settled in the early 19th century, and where Gary's grandparents still lived.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army. He had {{originally}} been classified 4F, or medically ineligible for the draft, because of a high school knee injury, and he felt that he was drafted only because he was a prominent athlete. He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big guns sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I spent most of my time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Grunge {{music has}} {{what has been}} called an [...] "ugly" [...] aesthetic, both in <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{distorted}} electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics. This approach was chosen both to counter the [...] "slick" [...] elegant sound of the then-predominant mainstream rock and because grunge artists wanted to mirror the [...] "ugliness" [...] they saw around them and shine a light on unseen [...] "depths and depravity" [...] of the real world. Some key individuals {{in the development of the}} grunge sound, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and the Melvins, explained grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as [...] "musical provocation". Grunge artists considered these bands [...] "cheesy" [...] but nonetheless enjoyed them; Buzz Osborne of the Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with. In the early 1990s, Nirvana's signature [...] "stop-start" [...] song format and alternating between soft and loud sections became a genre convention.|$|E
