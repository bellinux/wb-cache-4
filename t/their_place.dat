5|$|In {{this event}} {{there is a}} {{qualification}} round on the opening day, in which 40 to 70 athletes each jump once to ensure <b>their</b> <b>place</b> {{for the rest of}} the event's two individual competitions. 40 of these places are available in the first competition (compared to 50 in the similar Ski Jumping World Championships), which is narrowed down to 30 for the second competition. The order of jumps – or 'starting order' – in the qualification round is based on the athletes' current rank within the Ski Jumping World Cup standings in ascending order of points, with the leader (who is assigned a distinctive yellow bib) going last. A unique feature of the World Cup, which applies to all ski flying and ski jumping events, is that the top ten ranked athletes are in a 'pre-qualified' bracket: <b>their</b> <b>place</b> in the event is already secure, so their qualification jump is entirely optional.|$|E
