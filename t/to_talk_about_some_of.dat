5000|$|The MVP {{bystander}} approach frames men’s {{abuse of}} women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a male-dominated society. 24 Thus, the MVP approach emphasizes changing social norms {{as the key to}} prevention. By challenging men to speak up and “change group dynamics in male peer culture,”this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victim/perpetrator binary and gives men an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space.” ...|$|E
50|$|Sykes {{opens her}} {{stand-up}} routine by discussing the United States’ “first Black President,” Barack Obama. She uses this discussion {{to bring up}} some of the stereotypes facing African-American people in the US. Sykes also talks about some of the rhetoric surrounding Michelle Obama, calling the media out for asking when they will see, “the real Michelle Obama,” the implication of which is that Michelle Obama’s calm demeanor is an act to make her seem less stereotypically African-American. Sykes goes on <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the issues facing the President such as reforming health-care, national resistance to change, revamping education, immigration and racial injustice. In this way, Sykes’ comedy follows a very natural progression, centering on politics and flowing easily from one topic to the next.|$|E
30|$|Now, {{at the end}} of the paper, it is time <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> {{limitations}} of my research.

I don’t evaluate counterfactual welfare effect of SAFTA and AFTA, neither across sectors, nor across different skill groups.|$|R
50|$|Sykes then {{shifts the}} {{conversation}} <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> {{of her personal}} experiences.

5000|$|There are {{necessarily}} only finitely many standard numbers - but caution is required: we cannot gather {{them together and}} hold that {{the result is a}} well-defined mathematical set.

On the more serious side, I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the economic policy challenges that Germany faces.

RFID tags are remotely-powered data carriers that resemble the theft control tags {{that you might}} find in a sweater when buying clothing from a store. Like theft-control tags, RFID tags are powered and accessed from a distance using radio waves, but RFID tags differ from theft-control tags in {{that they tend to}} have more storage space and processing power.

We describe briefly the organisation of social security work, and go on <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the projects attempted by the OR team. We will not shrink from describing some of the successes but we will concentrate most attention on the things which did not achieve the expected results.

Somehow it was unthinkable the brute and his comrade should engage in quiet talk. For all that, he did not go, and turning back a few yards stopped again. He must not be a fool, and no doubt the fellow had come <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> goods his friends in the bush could supply. Marston did not want the goods, but forced himself to wait.|$|R

During my talk I will discuss the scientific goals of the STARDUST mission and provide a brief overview of the mission's design and flight. I will also discuss the recovery of the Stardust Sample Return Capsule (SRC), with an emphasis on those aspects of the recovery important for minimizing the degree of contamination (particularly organic contamination) of the samples.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> {{financial}} risks and to introduce some methods of measuring them.

40|$|Frank Smets {{has written}} an {{interesting}} and thought-provoking paper {{on the role of}} asset prices in the formulation of monetary policy. Of particular interest is his comparative analysis of Australia and Canada – two commodity-exporting economies that one might have thought would behave similarly, but which in fact differ in interesting ways. In my comments, I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the things that Smets discusses in his paper, as well as some things that he does not discuss. Let me begin with the things he discusses. When thinking about asset prices and monetary policy in a small open economy like Australia, perhaps the first asset price that comes to mind is the exchange rate. Policyinduced changes in the exchange rate are an important transmission channel through which monetary policy affects both inflation and activity. The most rapid transmission channel from monetary policy to inflation in an open economy occurs via the exchange rate’s effect on import prices. Other transmission channels eventually have a much larger impact on inflation, but they occur more gradually. The effect of changes in the exchange rate on activity arises, of course, because of the exchange rate’s effect on the volume of exports and imports and, therefore, on activity in the export and import-competin...|$|E

'Wear and Tear' {{contains}} {{poems about}} {{the birth of}} my son Gruffydd in 2009, a brother to Robert and Brendan {{they may not have}} expected, and the worlds he produced on his arrival. The poems in the 'Partly in Riga' section are from a few years earlier, and a result of a residency in Riga, Latvia as part of the 'Sealines' project. They try <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the difficulties of knowing and not knowing, of being there and immersed in the place and the culture, but not always understanding. 'Partly Local' tracks a number of journeys both within and outside north Wales, ranging from the Llyn Peninsula to Sussex and the Greek mainland, as well as journeys into the Welsh past through the poetry and landscapes of Dafydd ap Gwilym. The poems in 'Poor Relations' are an attempt to think consistently about contemporary politics at a time when, to me, that seemed to be impossible. They try to locate places of resistance and moments of compassion, however fleeting. The final section, 'The People Poems', takes forward the ideas in 'Poor relations' and explores a developing interest in the human figure, and a the changing and partial contexts produced by human activity. But they try to be about more than the figure, or the politicised human body; they try to be about people and the complexities of their histories, an inter-related present and their possible futures...|$|E
