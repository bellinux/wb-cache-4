5|$|When Mr. Cope died in 2008, his {{daughter}} draped his coffin with a quilt made from Terrible Towels that were sewn <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fan. She chose the quilt because {{it represents the}} many different people who touched their lives.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E

50|$|The Aero A.17 {{was a small}} {{sailplane}} {{built in}} Czechoslovakia in 1922. The conventional sailplane wing and tail were held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> open truss framework, which also supported the pilot.|$|R
50|$|Zinc flake {{coatings}} are non-electrolytically applied coatings, {{which provide}} good protection against corrosion. These coatings {{consist of a}} mixture of zinc and aluminium flakes, which are bonded <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> inorganic matrix.|$|R
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general type of wagon, the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> common meter alone.|$|E
2500|$|In the simplified, propositional case {{in which}} a logic program and a {{top-level}} atomic goal contain no variables, backward reasoning determines an and-or tree, which constitutes the search space for solving the goal. The top-level goal is the root of the tree. Given any node in the tree and any clause whose head matches the node, there exists a set of child nodes corresponding to the sub-goals {{in the body of the}} clause. These child nodes are grouped <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> [...] "and". The alternative sets of children corresponding to alternative ways of solving the node are grouped <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> [...] "or".|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, she {{was working}} on her third novel, Beauty's Hour, and it is likely that Yeats read the manuscript, {{suggested}} revisions, and {{may have contributed to the}} characterisations. Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> mutual interest in the occult. For Yeats, then aged 30, an important aspect of their friendship was the opportunity it presented for a sexual relationship with a woman, something he had not then experienced.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, {{like all}} dinucleotides, {{consists}} of two nucleosides joined {{by a pair of}} bridging phosphate groups. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{diagnosed}} with leukemia in 1996, and died from complications of the disease in Pebble Beach, California, on July 21, 1998. He was the second astronaut who had walked on the Moon to die, Jim Irwin being the first in 1991. His widow Louise resolved to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes, but she died {{from a heart attack}} five weeks later on August 25, 1998, at 17:00, the time at which Shepard had always called her. They had been married for 53 years. The family decided to cremate them both, and their ashes were scattered <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Navy helicopter over Stillwater Cove, in front of their Pebble Beach home.|$|E

5|$|The Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco is {{the head}} of the {{executive}} branch of the San Francisco city and county government. The mayor has the duty to enforce city laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the legislative branch. The mayor serves a four-year term and is limited to two successive terms. Because of San Francisco's status as a consolidated city-county, the mayor also serves as the head of government of the county; both entities have been governed <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> combined set of governing bodies since 1856.|$|E
5|$|Designed as {{a weapon}} with the longest reach in Soulcalibur, Ivy's sword Valentine {{consists}} of several smaller blades linked <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chain, able to take either broadsword or chain whip forms. These forms are represented by different stances Ivy can use in the series, altering many of her attacks for each and applying different uses to either form of the weapon, with some, such as Spiral Lust, a component of an existing attack. In addition to these the sword can also have the segments be split apart, in which case they will attack the opponent in different ways before recombining on the sword's chain. Due to her variety, Ivy has been noted as being able to attack from any range, however she has also been described as difficult to properly use unless utilizing a range the opponent is weakest at. However, attacks such as Ivy Brambler allow her greater variety in range, and allow for chaining into other attacks upon a successful strike. Other attacks, such as Summoning Suffering and Calamity Symphony, involve grappling with the opponent to damage them, though utilize complex controller inputs that require them to be utilized in tandem with other moves. With the Xbox Live release of Soulcalibur, due to its complexity the former was utilized for an achievement.|$|E
5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. Contrary to popular belief, this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled from young {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core tethering gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM image has since leaked on the Internet and can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E

5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. They are called hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{strong sense of}} collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated {{the creation of a}} bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held <b>together</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
