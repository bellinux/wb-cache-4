5|$|The Hungarians were {{mentioned}} under various ethnic names in Arabic, Byzantine, Slavic, and Western European {{sources in the}} 9th and 10th centuries. Arabic scholars referred to them as Magyars, Bashkirs, or Turks; Byzantine authors mentioned them as Huns, Ungrs, Turks, or Savards; Slavic sources used the ethnonyms Ugr or Peon, and Western European authors wrote of Hungrs, Pannons, Avars, Huns, Turks, and Agaren. According to <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Gyula Németh, the multiple ethnonymsespecially Ungr, Savard, and Turkreflect that the Magyars had been integrated in various empires of the Eurasian steppesthe tribal confederations of the Onogurs and of the Sabirs, and the Turkic Khaganatebefore gaining their independence.|$|E

25|$|The {{emphasis}} on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field {{work in the}} language concerned, so as to equip <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which {{can be stored in}} an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the resultative ganjing is {{situated}} within the verb aspect construction. The verb ca- takes the theta roles of agent and experiencer. Resultative phrases may also take multiple theta-roles. <b>The</b> <b>linguist</b> Fengqi Li calls these “composite roles”.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Robert Blust, {{proposed}} that the Sama-Bajaw languages derived from the Barito lexical region, though not from any established group.

25|$|Warndarang (also spelled Wandarang, Wandaran) is an extinct Aboriginal Australian {{language}} in the Arnhem family, formerly spoken by the Warndarang people in southern Arnhem Land, along the Gulf of Carpentaria.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>linguist</b> Paul Roberge {{suggested}} the earliest 'truly Afrikaans' texts are doggerel verse from 1795 and a dialogue transcribed by a Dutch traveller in 1825.

25|$|The Digil and Mirifle (Rahanweyn) are agro-pastoral clans in {{the area}} between the Jubba and Shebelle rivers. Many do not follow a nomadic lifestyle, live further south, and speak Maay.

25|$|Despite these differences, Occitan and Catalan remain {{more or less}} {{mutually}} comprehensible, {{especially when}} written — more so than either is with Spanish or French, for example, although this is mainly a consequence of using the classical (orthographical) norm of the Occitan, which is precisely focused in showing {{the similarities between the}} Occitan dialects with Catalan. Occitan and Catalan form a common diasystem (or a common Abstandsprache), which is called Occitano-Romance, according to <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Pierre Bec. Speakers of both languages share early historical and cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|The {{phonology}} {{of modern}} Cornish {{is based on}} a number of sources. The work of <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Edward Lhuyd who visited Cornwall in 1700 to record the language, as well as the modern Cornish dialect and accent of English, which got much of its intonation and sounds from the Cornish language, have provided a major source of input. Analysis of the traditional literature has also been used, as the Middle Cornish plays were often written in rhyming verse, and Late Cornish texts were written phonetically following English spelling conventions.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the blacks}} spoke Gullah, an Afro-English-based creole language. This {{enabled them to}} {{communicate}} better with Anglo-Americans than the Creek or Mikasuki-speaking Seminole. The Indians used the blacks as translators to advance their trading with the British and other tribes. Together in Florida they developed Afro-Seminole Creole, identified in 1978 as a distinct language by <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Ian Hancock. Black Seminoles and Freedmen continued to speak Afro-Seminole Creole through the 19th century in Oklahoma. Hancock found that in 1978, some Black Seminole and Seminole elders still spoke it in Oklahoma and in Florida.|$|E
25|$|Waterman and Alfred L. Kroeber, {{director}} of the museum, studied Ishi closely {{over the years and}} interviewed him at length to help them reconstruct Yahi culture. He described family units, naming patterns, and the ceremonies that he knew, but much tradition had been lost because there were few older survivors in the group in which he was raised. He identified material items and showed the techniques by which they were made. Ishi provided valuable information on his native Yana language, which was recorded and studied by <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects.|$|E
25|$|The {{conjunction}} y avoids denominational confusion {{when the}} paternal surname {{might appear to}} be a (first) name; hence the physiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal might appear to be named Santiago Ramón (composite) and surnamed Cajal, likewise the jurist Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and the cleric Vicente Enrique y Tarancón. Without the conjunction, the footballer Rafael Martín Vázquez, when referred to by his surnames Martín Vázquez mistakenly appears to be forenamed Martín rather than Rafael, whilst, to his annoyance, <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Fernando Lázaro Carreter occasionally was addressed as Don Lázaro, rather than as Don Fernando (Lázaro can be either forename or surname).|$|E

25|$|Context-free grammars {{arise in}} {{linguistics}} {{where they are}} used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a natural language, and they were in fact invented by <b>the</b> <b>linguist</b> Noam Chomsky for this purpose, but have not really lived up to their original expectation. By contrast, in computer science, as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of programming languages. In a newer application, they are used in {{an essential part of the}} Extensible Markup Language (XML) called the Document Type Definition.|$|E
