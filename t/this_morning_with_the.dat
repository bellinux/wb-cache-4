According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E

At this hearing, we 2 ̆ 7 ll examine the long and short term human health hazards caused by the exposure to PCB 2 ̆ 7 s.

This hearing will examine the development of groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley and the associated health risks of exposure to organic chemical contaminants such as tricholoroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). There has been a general concern that these substances have a variety of health effects in exposed humans and test animals. We will also examine state efforts to coordinate monitoring programs for the wells. Finally, we will address the concerns of affected water utilities and their efforts to clean up wells contaminated with TCE and PCE. The examination of various funding mechanisms for clean up costs will be a primary focus today...|$|R

We had to consider all this—to look at the magnitude of the crime, and to look also at the consideration that if this were not the first case brought under the Act, our duty might have obliged us to carry out the penalty it awards to the utmost extent; but taking into consideration {{that this is the first}} conviction under the Act—though the offence has been as clearly proved as any offence of the kind could be—the sentence of the court is that you, John Mitchel, be transported beyond the seas for the term of fourteen years." ...|$|R
