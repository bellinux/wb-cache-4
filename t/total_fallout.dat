40|$|Fallout of Chernobyl-derived {{radionuclides}} {{over the}} UK evidenced marked spatial variation. Relatively high levels {{were recorded in}} central Wales, but they declined rapidly {{to the east and}} southeast. As a result, the headwaters of the River Severn received substantial inputs of fallout, whereas only low levels were recorded over the middle and lower reaches of its drainage basin. This situation afforded a valuable opportunity to investigate the sediment-associated transport of Chernobyl-derived radiocaesium through the 10 000 km 2 drainage basin and its redistribution by fluvial processes. Information on the fallout inputs of radiocaesium has been obtained from the sampling of soil inventories across the basin. Measurements of the radiocaesium content of suspended sediment have been made at several sites on the main river over a period extending from before the Chernobyl disaster through to 1988. Concentrations of caesium- 137 in the suspended sediment increased by two orders of magnitude immediately after the accident up to 1450 mBq g – 1, declined rapidly subsequently, but remained almost an order of magnitude greater than the pre-Chernobyl levels throughout the remainder of the period (1986 – 1988). Downstream redistribution of radiocaesium has occurred as a result of deposition of sediment-associated radiocaesium in channel and floodplain sinks. It is estimated that 0. 6 % of the <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> input of Chernobyl-derived caesium- 134 has been transported out of the basin during the period 1986 – 1990.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to present some examples, based mainly on Swedish work, of late effects of nuclear {{accidents}} together with their implications and possible remedies, or absence of need for remedies. It took six years after the Three Mile Island accident before it was realized that the core was partially converted into very corrosion resistant corium which was distributed throughout the reactor system in the form of fines. It is essential that techniques for removal of such debris be developed for the Fukushima plant in order for large areas to become accessible. The ability of caesium- 137 to bind irreversibly to soil material is essential in conjunction with ploughing, since it will not only imply self-shielding but also that caesium- 137 is hindered from entering the groundwater as well as plants. Disposal of top soil material may be greatly facilitated if such immobilization can eliminate the need for a top seal. However, such operations are irreversible, and knowledge of the long-term properties of the soil material must be available before any decisions can be made. Thus, previous experience, especially on the long term behaviour is essential. Such long-term results are available in Sweden from tests started already in the early 60 's. The issues have been studied in substantial detail since the level of protection has been much higher in Sweden than e. g. in Japan. Otherwise, the <b>total</b> <b>fallouts</b> are comparable in magnitude with Sweden receiving around 5 % of the total from Chernobyl, and Japan receiving from Fukushima what corresponds to about 8 % of that from Chernobyl, all figured as caesium- 137. The distribution is much more concentrated in Japan, however. The major need for protection in Sweden relates to ash and reindeer in which areas Authority restrictions still apply. Even modest levels of caesium- 137 in the bio-fuel may lead to levels in the ash that warrant consideration. Godkänd; 2014; 20140611 (rolsjo...|$|R

40|$|The 39 [*]ka Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) super-eruption was {{the largest}} {{volcanic}} eruption of the past 200 [*]ka in Europe. Tephra deposits indicate two distinct plume forming phases, Plinian and co-ignimbrite, characteristic of many caldera-forming eruptions. Previous numerical studies have characterized the eruption as a single-phase event, potentially leading to inaccurate assessment of eruption dynamics. To reconstruct the volume, intensity, and duration of the tephra dispersal, we applied a computational inversion method that explicitly accounts for the Plinian and co-ignimbrite phases and for gravitational spreading of the umbrella cloud. To verify the consistency of our results, we performed an additional single-phase inversion using an independent thickness dataset. Our better-fitting two-phase model suggests a higher mass eruption rate than previous studies, and estimates that 3 / 4 of the <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> volume is co-ignimbrite in origin. Gravitational spreading of the umbrella cloud dominates tephra transport only within the first hundred kilometres due to strong stratospheric winds in our best-fit wind model.

40|$|On 11 March 2011, an {{earthquake}} occurred about 130 km off the Pacific coast of Japan's main island Honshu, {{followed by a}} large tsunami. The resulting loss of electric power at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant (FD-NPP) developed into a disaster causing massive release of radioactivity into the atmosphere. In this study, we determine the emissions of two isotopes, the noble gas xenon- 133 ( 133 Xe) and the aerosol-bound caesium- 137 ( 137 Cs), which have very different release characteristics as well as behavior in the atmosphere. To determine radionuclide emissions {{as a function of}} height and time until 20 April, we made a first guess of release rates based on fuel inventories and documented accident events at the site. This first guess was subsequently improved by inverse modeling, which combined the first guess with the results of an atmospheric transport model, FLEXPART, and measurement data from several dozen stations in Japan, North America and other regions. We used both atmospheric activity concentration measurements as well as, for 137 Cs, measurements of bulk deposition. Regarding 133 Xe, we find a total release of 16. 7 (uncertainty range 13. 4 – 20. 0) EBq, which is the largest radioactive noble gas release in history not associated with nuclear bomb testing. There is strong evidence that the first strong 133 Xe release started very early, possibly immediately after the earthquake and the emergency shutdown on 11 March at 06 : 00 UTC. The entire noble gas inventory of reactor units 1 – 3 was set free into the atmosphere between 11 and 15 March 2011. For 137 Cs, the inversion results give a total emission of 35. 8 (23. 3 – 50. 1) PBq, or about 42 % of the estimated Chernobyl emission. Our results indicate that 137 Cs emissions peaked on 14 – 15 March but were generally high from 12 until 19 March, when they suddenly dropped by orders of magnitude exactly when spraying of water on the spent-fuel pool of unit 4 started. This indicates that emissions were not only coming from the damaged reactor cores, but also from the spent-fuel pool of unit 4 and confirms that the spraying was an effective countermeasure. We also explore the main dispersion and deposition patterns of the radioactive cloud, both regionally for Japan {{as well as for the}} entire Northern Hemisphere. While at first sight it seemed fortunate that westerly winds prevailed most of the time during the accident, a different picture emerges from our detailed analysis. Exactly during and following the period of the strongest 137 Cs emissions on 14 and 15 March as well as after another period with strong emissions on 19 March, the radioactive plume was advected over Eastern Honshu Island, where precipitation deposited a large fraction of 137 Cs on land surfaces. The plume was also dispersed quickly over the entire Northern Hemisphere, first reaching North America on 15 March and Europe on 22 March. In general, simulated and observed concentrations of 133 Xe and 137 Cs both at Japanese as well as at remote sites were in good quantitative agreement with each other. Altogether, we estimate that 6. 4 TBq of 137 Cs, or 19 % of the <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> until 20 April, were deposited over Japanese land areas, while most of the rest fell over the North Pacific Ocean. Only 0. 7 TBq, or 2 % of the <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> were deposited on land areas other than Japan...|$|E

The compiled reference inventories decrease from north to south. Three global estimates of 137 Cs <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> are also reviewed and compared to the measured data while taking into account factors that affect the fallout estimates and the reference inventory.

The measured 137 Cs concentrations suggest that a minimum detectable activity (MDA) less than 0. 5 Bq/kg is required for detection of 137 Cs activity in topsoils in the lowest reference inventory areas. This sensitivity should allow, at present, 137 Cs to be {{a useful tool for}} analysis of soil erosion in Southeast Asia, should also be a useful chronometer, and will be a useful tracer at least where the reference inventory is more than 500 - 600 Bq/m 2.

The study began by investigating concentrations within urban sources. In addition to the more commonly studied wastewater treatment plant effluent, wet weather urban sources (including combined sewer overflows, urban runoff, and <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>fallout)</b> were considered. The initial results highlight a significant contamination of all urban sources (from a few nanograms per liter in atmospheric fallout to several micrograms per liter in the other sources) with clearly distinguishable distribution patterns. Secondly, concentration changes along the Seine River from upstream of the Paris Metropolitan area to downstream were investigated. While the concentrations of BPA and nonylphenoxy acetic acid (NP(1) EC) increase substantially due to urban sources, the 4 -nonylphenol concentrations remain homogeneous along the Seine. These results suggest a broad dissemination of 4 -nonylphenol at the scale of the Seine River basin. Moreover, the relationship between pollutant concentrations and Seine River flow was assessed both upstream and downstream of the Paris conurbation. Consequently, a sharp decrease in dissolved NP(1) EC concentrations relative to Seine River flow underscores {{the influence of}} single-point urban pollution on Seine River contamination. Conversely, dissolved 4 -nonylphenol concentrations serve to reinforce the hypothesis of its widespread presence at the Seine River basin scale...|$|R

This work, led by two different research groups, allowed to reach two main goals: {{to define a}} simple analytical procedure to secure accurate shipboard sampling and analysis of atmospheric deposition, and to assess anthropogenic impacts of heavy metals to the environment. The first step about the validation step showed that the prevalent deposition type was dry deposition which represents 40, 60 and 80 % for Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. This prevalence of dry deposition in <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>fallout</b> supported the necessity of funnel wall rinsing which contains 30, 50 and 40 % of collected Cd, Cu and Pb, respectively. Moreover, the reproducibility of atmospheric deposition collection was determined. The second step was performed by comparing two sampling sites. A rural sampling site, situated in Morvan's regional park (250 km south-east of Paris), was chosen for its isolation from any local and regional contamination sources. Fluxes obtained in this area were compared with those obtained at an urban site (Creteil, suburb of Paris) allowing comparison between {{urban and rural areas}} and demonstrating the impact of anthropogenic activities on atmospheric deposition of Cr, Cu and Pb...|$|R
40|$|The use of 36 C 1 as an {{environmental}} tracer of hydrologic processes has become increasingly popular over the last twenty years. The use of this isotope in hydrogeology has been limited, however, by uncertainty in the input function for 36 C 1 entering groundwater. To address this problem and to evaluate current 36 C 1 /C 1 distribution models, 36 C 1 /C 1 was measured for 183 groundwater samples collected from sites located throughout the United States. On the continental scale, values of 36 C 11 C 1 range from less than 100 x 10 - 15 in coastal regions to over 1, 200 x 1015 in Wyoming. This distribution {{is dominated by the}} spatial variability of stable chloride fallout. The depositional flux of 36 C 1 is approximately constant over the United States with a mean of 21. 3 + 2. 7 atoms 111 - 2 S- 1 which is equivalent to a global flux of 13. 6 + 1. 7 atoms r 62 s 4. A simple model developed in this study, which assumes constant 36 C 1 deposition, consistently yields high estimates of 36 C 11 C 1 in the southwestern part of the country. This discrepancy may indicate that the relative amount of dry to <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> {{is an important factor in}} controlling 36 C 1 /C 1 in arid areas and requires further investigation. Variability of 36 C 11 C 1 at the local scale is primarily controlled by subsurface sources of chloride. Auxiliary data, such as bromide concentrations, are often useful for identifying and interpreting these localized processes. In this study, three schemes for correcting this effect are explored: i) binary mixing models, ii) scaling by chloride concentrations and iii) scaling by chloride-bromide ratios...|$|E
40|$|The 39 [*]ka Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) super-eruption was {{the largest}} {{volcanic}} eruption of the past 200 [*]ka in Europe. Tephra deposits indicate two distinct plume forming phases, Plinian and co-ignimbrite, characteristic of many caldera-forming eruptions. Previous numerical studies have characterized the eruption as a single-phase event, potentially leading to inaccurate assessment of eruption dynamics. To reconstruct the volume, intensity, and duration of the tephra dispersal, we applied a computational inversion method that explicitly accounts for the Plinian and co-ignimbrite phases and for gravitational spreading of the umbrella cloud. To verify the consistency of our results, we performed an additional single-phase inversion using an independent thickness dataset. Our better-fitting two-phase model suggests a higher mass eruption rate than previous studies, and estimates that 3 / 4 of the <b>total</b> <b>fallout</b> volume is co-ignimbrite in origin. Gravitational spreading of the umbrella cloud dominates tephra transport only within the first hundred kilometres due to strong stratospheric winds in our best-fit wind model. Finally, tephra fallout impacts would have interrupted the westward migration of modern hominid groups in Europe, possibly supporting the hypothesis of prolonged Neanderthal survival in South-Western Europe during the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the nuclear era, starting during the 1940 s, large amount of radioactivity has been released into the environment. This thesis deals with the temporal and spatial distribution of the anthropogenic radioisotope 129 I (T 1 / 2 = 15. 7 Myr) in northern Europe. A routine sample preparation procedure for extraction of iodine from milligram amounts of solid materials has been developed and aimed for measuring the 129 I concentration by the ultra-sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry method. The technique was further used for the analysis of 129 I in sediments collected from two lakes in Sweden and one lake in Finland as well as sediments from two sites in the Baltic Sea. In addition, 129 I concentrations in aerosol samples from northern and southern Sweden covering the period 1983 to 2000 have been measured. The results reveal a gradual increase in the anthropogenic 129 I fluxes since the 1950 s that are linked to emissions from the nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France). A sharp increase coinciding with the Chernobyl accident is identified from the Swedish lakes located in areas characterised by relatively high Chernobyl fallout. Numerical modeling of the 129 I deposition predicts that > 50 % of the flux to the lake sediments is related to the liquid emissions from the reprocessing facilities. The modeling also reasonably simulates the contribution of the Chernobyl event to the total 129 I flux. The novel time series from northern Europe on 129 I in aerosols show about one order of magnitude higher concentration in northern compared to southern Sweden. Estimate of 129 I dry fallout based on the aerosol data suggests < 25 % contribution to the <b>total</b> <b>fallout.</b> The distribution of 129 I in the sediment archives demonstrates the potential of the isotope as a new time marker for chronological and environmental investigations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe plastic {{production}} has increased rapidly from 1. 7 to 288 million tons annually {{within the last}} 60 years (PlasticsEurope 2013). In the early 70 ’s, the presence of millimetric plastic debris in marine environment has been highlighted and more recently the term microplastics was used to describe millimetric and inframillimetric particles. Since 2008, plastic particles smaller than 5 mm have been defined as microplastics (Barnes et al. 2009). These microplastics cover a large and continuous spectrum of sizes and shapes including 1 D-fibers (with one larger dimension), 2 D-fragments (flat particles), and 3 D-spherules. While numerous studies were published on microplastic in marine environment, only few are dealing with these pollutants in continental environments. Moreover most of these studies are dealing with lakes and rivers, but none focused on the contamination of atmospheric compartment by microplastics. In addition to experimentations on <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>fallout</b> (Dris et al. 2015 a), this study aims at investigating the contamination of indoor and outdoor air by microplastics. Indoor air concentrations of microplastics (number of particles/m 3) were measured in 2 private apartments and 1 office at the Paris-Est University. Volumes about 5 m 3 over a 24 h-period were pumped using a Deltanova pump (8 L/min) on glass fiber GF/A Whatman® filters (1. 6 µm). In addition, household dust was also sampled using conventional vacuum cleaner and collected in the vacuum cleaner bag. Outdoor air samples were collected on the University roof located in an urbanized area (about 10 km from Paris center) and about 10 m 3 were pumped over a same period. In both cases, the total dust sampling modes were considered. Filters were then observed with a stereomicroscope Leica MZ 12 coupled with a software for image analyzing to account microplastics. For methodological reasons, the minimal microplastic particle size considered {{in this study is}} about 50 µm. For dust, a densimetric separation coupled with an enzymatic digestion was performed. Microplastics observed in indoor and outdoor air are exclusively fibrous with a size distribution. Fibers are mainly sub-millimetric (50 - 80 % between 100 and 500 µm) {{and to a lesser extent}} millimetric (10 - 30 % between 500 and 1 000 µm or between 1 000 and 5 000 µm). First campaigns indicate that indoor concentrations are in the 3 - 15 particles/m 3 range. A gradient of indoor concentrations according to the sampling height (30, 125 and 250 cm) was also observed suggesting that the microplastics are mainly re suspended from the floor probably due to human activity and movement. Finally, a significant amount of fibers is observed in dust. Outdoor concentrations are lower than those observed for indoor and are in the 0. 2 - 0. 8 particles/m 3 range. Due to their size, a high deposition velocity of microplastics may be expected and could explain the low concentrations observed. Parallel to that, a significant amount of particles is also observed in <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>fallout</b> (29 - 280 particles/m 2 /d), confirming the contamination of atmospheric compartment by microplastics. The time-variation of this flux seems to be strongly influenced by rain events suggesting that the microplastic wash out could be a major route of deposition. The chemical identification of the microplastics is in progress using Raman micro spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study aimed at: (a) {{providing}} {{information on the}} occurrence and concentration ranges in urban stormwater for {{a wide array of}} pollutants (n[*]=[*] 77); (b) assessing whether despite the differences between various catchments (land use, climatic conditions, etc.), the trends in terms of contamination level are similar; and (c) analyzing the contribution of <b>total</b> atmospheric <b>fallout</b> (TAF) with respect to sources endogenous to this contamination. The studied contaminants include conventional stormwater contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Zn, Cu, Pb, etc.), in addition to poorly or undocumented pollutants such as nonylphenol and octylphenol ethoxylates (NPnEO and OPnEO), bisphenol A (BPA), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a wide variety of pesticides, and various metals of relevance (As, Ti, Sr, V). Sampling and analysis were performed using homogeneous methods on three urban catchments with different land use patterns located in three distinct French towns. For many of these pollutants, the results do not allow highlighting a significant difference in stormwater quality at the scale of the three urban catchments considered. Significant differences were, however, observed for several metals (As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sr and Zn), PAHs, and PBDEs, though this assessment would need to be confirmed by further experiments. The pollutant distributions between dissolved and particulate phases were found to be similar across the three experimental sites, thus suggesting no site dependence. Lastly, the contributions of TAF to stormwater contamination for micropollutants were quite low. This finding held true not only for PAHs, as previously demonstrated in the literature, but also for a broader range of molecules such as BPA, NPnEO, OPnEO, and PBDEs, whose high local production is correlated with the leaching of urban surfaces, buildings, and vehicles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInverse {{modelling}} {{techniques can}} be used to estimate the amount of radionuclides and the temporal profile of the source term released in the atmosphere during the accident of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. In Winiarek et al. (2012 b), the lower bounds of the caesium- 137 and iodine- 131 source terms were estimated with such techniques, using activity concentration measurements. The importance of an objective assessment of prior errors (the observation errors and the background errors) was emphasised for a reliable inversion. In such critical context where the meteorological conditions can make the source term partly unobservable and where only a few observations are available, such prior estimation techniques are mandatory, the retrieved source term being very sensitive to this estimation. We propose to extend the use of these techniques to the estimation of prior errors when assimilating observations from several data sets. The aim is to compute an estimate of the caesium- 137 source term jointly using all available data about this radionuclide, such as activity concentrations in the air, but also daily <b>fallout</b> measurements and <b>total</b> cumulated <b>fallout</b> measurements. It is crucial to properly and simultaneously estimate the background errors and the prior errors relative to each data set. A proper estimation of prior errors is also a necessary condition to reliably estimate the a posteriori uncertainty of the estimated source term. Using such techniques, we retrieve a total released quantity of caesium- 137 in the interval 11. 6 − 19. 3 PBq with an estimated standard deviation range of 15 − 20 % depending on the method and the data sets. The "blind" time intervals of the source term have also been strongly mitigated compared to the first estimations with only activity concentration data...|$|R
