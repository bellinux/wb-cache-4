40|$|A {{human factors}} study {{was carried out}} to assess drivers 2 ̆ 7 <b>tailgating</b> {{behavior}} {{and the effect of}} advisory signs in mitigating <b>tailgating.</b> <b>Tailgating</b> is a dangerous driving behavior and a leading cause of most rear-end crashes. Through a prior study, serious <b>tailgating</b> was identified on urban Rhode Island highways. It is critical to many urban traffic management authorities to understand <b>tailgating</b> and to explore means to mitigate drivers’ <b>tailgating</b> behavior, especially on urban highways with high-speed and high-volume traffic. Properly designed advisory signs could reduce <b>tailgating</b> and related motor crashes. To assess drivers 2 ̆ 7 behavior with regards to <b>tailgating,</b> a questionnaire survey was developed and given to a number of subjects with daily highway driving experience. The survey is designed to identify causes of <b>tailgating</b> and drivers’ perceptions and engagements on <b>tailgating</b> behavior.

To help mitigate <b>tailgating</b> behavior, advisory signs and an educational video were developed. The effectiveness of these proposed countertailgating measures was assessed in the driving simulation. Subjects’ real driving behaviors were further studied in a follow-up field study. Study results found that the majority had an incorrect sense regarding safe following distance and were <b>tailgating</b> while driving on highways.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they <b>tailgate</b> cars.|$|E

Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back.

The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the <b>tailgate</b> as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

Understanding <b>tailgating</b> and finding means to mitigate <b>tailgating</b> behavior on highways has become a priority to many urban traffic management authorities. A human factors study was conducted to investigate the <b>tailgating</b> issue and possible counter-tailgating measures. The study started with a questionnaire survey and a traffic analysis to assess the causes and effects of <b>tailgating</b> and its impact on urban RI highway traffic. To identify drivers’ perceptions on <b>tailgating</b> behavior, 210 subjects were recruited in the survey. It found that 95 % of participants are potential tailgators and heavy traffic was identified as the top <b>tailgating</b> cause. Vehicle headways on specific urban segments of three major RI highways were next examined in the traffic analysis. It found that over 60 % of vehicles were <b>tailgating</b> during rush hours and about 40 % during non-rush hours. The findings confirmed that serious <b>tailgating</b> exists on urban RI highways. To advise drivers and mitigate their <b>tailgating</b> behaviors, counter-tailgating measures such as advisory signs and an educational video were designed and assessed through a driving simulation experiment. Pronounced effect of advisory signs on limiting <b>tailgating</b> was identified especially after subjects viewing the video. Participants’ driving behaviors were further studied through a field study. The majority found it difficult to maintain a safe following distance in a real driving environment without employing any measures.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} microscopic study of <b>tailgating</b> behavior of drivers. There {{are very few}} studies focused on <b>tailgating,</b> although {{it is a serious}} issue for traffic safety. The reason for very few studies might be the fact that <b>tailgating</b> is a complex problem involving human behavior and kinematics of the vehicle and it is also equally challenging to collect naturalistic driving data relevant to <b>tailgating.</b> Because this approach is empirical, we developed a sophisticated data acquisition system using an instrumented vehicle to collect naturalistic driving data. Data were collected on freeways in Maryland during times of moderate traffic flow. The instrumented vehicle was driven in a naturalistic way that was benign to the surrounding traffic. <b>Tailgating</b> events were detected using the empirical data and a model of safe following distance. We tested and affirmed the hypothesis that tailgaters of short <b>tailgating</b> duration are more willing to follow at close following distances than those who <b>tailgated</b> for longer durations. We also tested and affirmed the hypothesis that following vehicle speeds are strongly influenced by lead vehicle speeds. We studied the causal relations between certain observable data from the lead vehicle and possible reactions in the following vehicle. We contributed new estimates of driver reaction times, focusing on a subset of the population deemed to be <b>tailgating</b> at the time. We also conducted a new calibration of the well-known GHR car-following model that is specific to <b>tailgating</b> situations. The data and method for collecting the data are contemporary and relevant to current modes of thinking in traffic flow theory. The results can contribute directly to models and parameter estimates in microscopic simulators. Many of the results would also be of use in the automotive industry, for the development of driver safety assistance systems and countermeasures. Finally, we think the results could be useful for driving instructors, to help students understand better this dangerous driving behavior. In the end, we hope that this study could help to improve traffic safety by reducing the number of crashes resulting from this behavior...|$|R
