5|$|Within {{the first}} year of opening, it became {{apparent}} to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the CCE and the other UERL lines had been over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways, and the later extensions, the CCE struggled financially. In 1933 the CCE {{and the rest of the}} UERL were taken into public ownership. Today, the CCE's tunnels and stations form the Northern line's Charing Cross branch from Kennington to Camden Town, the Edgware branch from Camden <b>Town</b> <b>to</b> Edgware, and the High Barnet branch from Camden <b>Town</b> <b>to</b> Archway.|$|E

5|$|Belgrade has wildly varying {{architecture}}, {{from the}} center of Zemun, typical of a Central European <b>town,</b> <b>to</b> the more modern architecture and spacious layout of New Belgrade. The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions. The oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish türbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dorćol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental <b>town</b> <b>to</b> the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture are present in buildings such as Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gračanica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.|$|E
