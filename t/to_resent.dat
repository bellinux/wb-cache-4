5|$|In {{the eight}} {{weeks leading up}} to her wedding, Susan avoids any contact with Katherine. Katherine begins <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> Susan, even {{threatening}} to pour tomato sauce on Susan's wedding dress. Mike is concerned for Katherine, but Susan is frustrated with her behavior. On the day of the wedding, Katherine demands that Susan apologize to her in public. Susan obliges, expressing her sorrow to Katherine during the wedding ceremony. Katherine tells Susan that the apology does not help mend their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly {{believed that it was}} Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{was called}} to {{the bar at the}} Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He {{frequently}} visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> the editors.|$|E

5|$|Still {{separated}} from Carmela, Tony is living at his parents' house. Carmela, now the sole authority {{figure in the}} home, becomes frustrated as her rules lead A.J. <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> her; eventually she allows him {{to live with his}} father. She has a brief relationship with Robert Wegler, A.J.'s guidance counselor; he breaks it off abruptly when he suspects that she is manipulating him to improve A.J.'s grades. Tony and Carmela reconcile; Tony promises to be more loyal and agrees to pay for a piece of real estate Carmela wishes to develop.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is visited by her ex-boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), who informs {{her that he}} is a sex addict, now atoning for his past errors. Liz is unimpressed and asks Dennis to leave, before going to work. Later, after {{arriving}} at work, Liz answers Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) cellphone, and is surprised to find that Dennis is calling Jenna. Liz pretends to be Jenna and discovers that Jenna and Dennis slept together. Liz is determined not to let this revelation affect her friendship with Jenna, so the two go to confront Dennis about his behavior. During the confrontation, Liz discovers that Jenna and Dennis actually slept together in her bed, leading her <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> Jenna's actions. As a result, she fails to tell Jenna about an improperly attached piece of equipment, leading Jenna to injure her leg.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

5000|$|His {{three years}} at Princeton were unhappy. The style of {{classical}} study there {{was very different from}} what he was used to at Oxford, with Princeton's scholarship [...] "consisting of extremely detailed analyses of classical texts and sources—thorough, but unoriginal." [...] He began to rebel against his father's ideals: he stopped going to church and put increasing energy into his writing at the expense of his studies; furthermore, in addition <b>to</b> <b>resenting</b> his financial dependence on his father, he continued his relationship with Dorothy even though he knew his father would not approve of her American, Lowland Scottish, Christian Science, business-world background. During this time, MacLennan also began to be influenced by Marxism.|$|R
5|$|The Judge Dredd {{comic strip}} is mostly set in Mega-City One in the 22nd century, {{on the east}} coast of the former United States. When President Robert L. Booth started the Third World War in 2070 (see Atomic Wars), the Judges – until then no more than a police force with {{extraordinary}} powers – deposed Booth, overthrew the Constitution and seized control of all institutions of government. Disillusioned with the elected politicians who had caused so much destruction to their country, much of the American public supported this move at the time. For the next four decades America was a dictatorship. (Mega-City One and the other American mega-cities became sovereign city-states early during this period, and the US ceased to exist.) Although the Judges were initially popular, the citizens soon grew <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> their new leaders as much as they had the old, until activists began calling for a return to democratic government.|$|E
5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E

5|$|In 788, Staurakios is {{recorded}} as attending {{as a judge}} in the bride show for the 17-year-old Constantine VI, along with Irene and the young Byzantine emperor himself. Maria of Amnia was chosen, although Constantine was unhappy about the breaking up of his earlier betrothal with Rotrude, Charlemagne's daughter. From this point on, he began <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> his mother's control over state affairs {{and the power of}} her eunuch officials. Along with a few trusted conspirators, Constantine planned to arrest Staurakios and exile him to Sicily, while he would assume his position as effective co-ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Their plans were preempted by Staurakios, however: he persuaded Irene to arrest, torture, exile or imprison Constantine's associates, while Constantine himself was placed under house arrest. Next, Irene demanded of the army an oath of loyalty, whose wording placed her before her son in precedence. This demand provoked a mutiny by the soldiers of the Armeniac Theme, which then spread throughout the Anatolian armies, which assembled in Bithynia and demanded Emperor Constantine's release. Bowing to their pressure, Irene capitulated and Constantine was installed as sole ruler in December 790. Among Constantine's first acts was to have Staurakios flogged, tonsured, and exiled to the Armeniac Theme, while all other eunuch officials were likewise exiled.|$|E
5|$|Poseidon– The former God of the Sea. Poseidon {{also participated}} in the Olympian wager in the God of War comic series by {{choosing}} Herodius as his champion. Herodius was killed by Kratos, causing Poseidon to release his hippocampus to destroy Kratos' ship, but Kratos and his men managed to escape. After becoming the champion of the gods, Poseidon later tasked Kratos with slaying the Hydra in God of War and granted him the magic, Poseidon's Rage. Poseidon came <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> Kratos {{for his role in}} the destruction of Atlantis in Ghost of Sparta, and, in God of War III, he was killed by Kratos during the Spartan's assault on Olympus, which caused the oceans to flood the world. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Poseidon is one of the four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was originally voiced by Fred Tatasciore in God of War. Gideon Emery took over the role in God of War III, and continued it in Ghost of Sparta and Ascension.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come <b>to</b> <b>resent</b> their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
50|$|As a Crane, Ethan {{lived a life}} {{of luxury}} and power. Being Julian's first-born son, he was bred to be {{the heir to the}} Crane fortune. This, coupled with his mother's favoritism of Ethan over her other three {{children}} with Julian, caused Ethan's half-siblings <b>to</b> deeply <b>resent</b> him, especially his half-brother, Fox.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} {{for a few moments}} after this.

5|$|Peggy married Eric Mitchell {{because she}} was {{pregnant}} with Phil (Steve McFadden). Eric, a keen boxer, worked for gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Johnny would taunt Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric {{fell in love with a}} woman called Maureen and planned to elope with her, but changed his mind, unable to desert his family, who he grew <b>to</b> <b>resent.</b> Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil. The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a Post Office robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but changed his mind, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother Archie (Larry Lamb) because he was there for her when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 - her only daughter Samantha (Danniella Westbrook and Kim Medcalf). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when Kevin Masters (Colin McCormack) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.|$|E
