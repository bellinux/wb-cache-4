5|$|Apparent <b>teleology</b> is a {{recurring}} issue in evolutionary biology, {{much to the}} consternation of some writers, and as an explanatory style it remains controversial. There are various reasons for discomfort with <b>teleology</b> among biologists.|$|E
5|$|<b>Teleology</b> {{in biology}} {{is the use}} of the {{language}} of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation, which some biologists and philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. <b>Teleology</b> is the principle that some phenomena exist because they result in a goal being fulfilled. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology to have been made to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of <b>teleology</b> in biology has attracted criticism, and {{attempts have been made to}} teach students to avoid teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such <b>teleology</b> describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.|$|E

5000|$|In 1965 Ernst Mayr cited Pittendrigh {{and criticized}} {{him for not}} making a [...] "clear {{distinction}} between the two <b>teleologies</b> of Aristotle"; evolution involves Aristotle's material causes and formal causes rather than efficient causes.

5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real <b>teleology</b> in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E

These were the circumstances that dictated my choice of writing on “A Sketch of the Past”, published in Moments of Being – A Collection of Autobiographical Writing, (1976, 1985) and of analysing the narrative strategies used by the author to tell herself, to construct her identity and power, giving voice and authority to herself as a discursive formation...|$|R
25|$|Kant {{published}} a second {{edition of the}} Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) in 1787, heavily revising the first parts of the book. Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy. He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788's Critique of Practical Reason (known as the second Critique) and 1797's Metaphysics of Morals. The 1790 Critique of Judgment (the third Critique) applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and <b>teleology.</b>|$|E
25|$|We {{are able}} to {{apprehend}} and represent nature to ourselves in the successive forms which its development assumes {{since it is the}} same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external <b>teleology</b> in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.|$|E
25|$|In {{what little}} Wieser wrote about methodology, {{he stated that}} {{economics}} {{is a kind of}} applied psychology for which the procedure is introspection, claiming similarity between Economics and sociology in that both attempt to achieve a more successful social reality of man, promoting the idea of utility that reports on each good and each individual. Aside from abandoning essentialism, both Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Wieser advocated objectively considering subjective factors, setting aside ideas that believe in the existence of an objective superhuman (essentialism) and theories of subjective elements that are incapable of objective measures (<b>teleology</b> of causality).|$|E
40|$|Artists, architects, {{musicians and}} archaeologists have all pondered the {{universal}} applicability {{of their own}} discipline and wondered at the bounty available through the dissolving of disciplinary constraints. But this paper argues that strong, speculative interdisciplinary work necessarily requires strong and vital disciplinary centres. My own interdisciplinary navigations outwards from architecture towards archaeology have explored, in particular, similarities between architectural and archaeological drawing practices revealing otherwise obscured resemblances between the purported aims of those disciplines. Central amongst these repressed similarities being the fallacy of regarding archaeology as past-facing and architecture as future-facing. This paper argues that despite these temporal <b>teleologies</b> both disciplines are enacted {{in the present and}} that their ostensibly unconnected practices of design and reconstruction in fact share common aims with positive repercussions for both disciplines...|$|R

This article proposes an update and expansion of the organological tradition, examining the discourses and practices surrounding both musical and scientifi c instruments. Drawing on examples from many periods and genres, we aim to capture instruments’ diverse ways of life. To that end we propose and describe a comparative “ethics of instruments”: an analysis of instruments’ material configurations, social and institutional locations, degrees of freedom, and <b>teleologies.</b> This perspective {{makes it possible to}} trace the intersecting and at times divergent histories of science and music: their shared material practices, aesthetic commitments, and attitudes toward technology, as well as their impact on understandings of human agency and the order of nature...|$|R

25|$|The {{political}} {{aspects of}} Rand's philosophy are discussed by Bernstein in The Capitalist Manifesto (2005). In Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics (1996), George Reisman attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both Classical and Austrian economics. In psychology, Professor Edwin A. Locke and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand's ideas in The Selfish Path to Romance: How to Love with Passion & Reason. Other writers have explored {{the application of}} Objectivism to fields ranging from art, as in What Art Is by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi (2000), to <b>teleology,</b> as in The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts by Harry Binswanger (1990).|$|E
25|$|Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's {{theory of}} vision, {{but did not}} make any {{corresponding}} changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, <b>teleology</b> and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly {{came to realize that}} the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. Many of the restrictions described by Aristotle and later favoured by the Catholic Church were thus challenged. This development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries.|$|E
25|$|The book {{begins with}} an {{extensive}} review of many topics {{in the history of}} ideas the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of <b>teleology</b> and intelligent design. They discuss the writings of Fichte, Hegel, Bergson, and Alfred North Whitehead, and the Omega Point cosmology of Teilhard de Chardin. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish teleological reasoning from eutaxiological reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.|$|E
40|$|Life {{originated}} from unicellular organisms by circumventing the Second Law of Thermodynamics using the First Principles of Physiology, namely negentropy, chemiosmosis and homeostatic regulation of calcium and lipids. It is hypothesized that multicellular organisms are merely contrivances or tools, used by unicellular organisms as agents for {{the acquisition of}} epigenetic inheritance. The First Principles of Physiology, which initially evolved in unicellular organisms are the exapted constraints that maintain, sustain and perpetuate that process. To ensure fidelity to this mechanism, we must return to the first principles of the unicellular state as the determinants of the primary level of selection pressure during the life cycle. The power {{of this approach is}} reflected by examples of its predictive value. This perspective on life is a "game changer", mechanistically rendering transparent many dogmas, <b>teleologies</b> and tautologies that constrain the current descriptive view of Biology...|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, while Beck {{points to}} {{environmentalism}} as a paradigm {{case of the}} progressive potential of the personalisation of politics, Erik Swyngedouw reminds us that in the guise in which it most often appears in the developed world, environmentalism's emphasis on personal lifestyle choices and on particularist struggles against the locally felt effects of environmental [...] "bads" [...] can work to draw {{attention away from the}} properly political issue of human society's structural relationship with nature. Likewise, Beck celebrates the new scepticism associated with post-modern, identity-based politics as a progressive consequence of the universal uncertainty that characterises risk society. By contrast, critics lament the profound consequences that the anti-essentialist position on truth has had for the imagination of [...] "grand narratives" [...] (read political <b>teleologies)</b> [...] - for proponents of the post-political critique, it is these grand narratives that are the real substance of politics.|$|R
40|$|This is the {{historical}} movement of hybridity as camouflage, as a contesting antagonistic agency functioning {{in the time}} lag of sign/symbol, which is a space in-between the rules of engagement. – Bhabha, 1994, 193 Today‟s self-proclaimed mobile and multiple identities may be a marker not of contemporary social fluidity and dispossession but of a new stability, self-assurance and quietism. – Young, 1995, 4 In much of contemporary cultural criticism there is a celebration of diaspora and hybridity as spaces of subversion. The terms are attractive because of the inherent instability associated with each concept. In contrast with the unappealing <b>teleologies</b> of modernist paradigms or the paralyzing binaries of either/or frameworks, hybridity and diaspora seem to offer a satisfyingly unstable and ambivalent alternative. For many poststructuralist critics, conceptualizations of the mobile, marginal, contradictory, and ambiguous are especially soothing in a period where {{a growing number of}} Marxist and feminist scholars have demanded locations of actual resistance in addition to positions of textual critique.

25|$|Another set {{of issues}} {{concerns}} the nature of critique, often replaying debates over (what can be crudely termed) universalism and relativism, where modernism is seen to represent the former and postmodernity the latter. Seyla Benhabib (1995) and Judith Butler (1995) pursue this debate in relation to feminist politics, Benhabib arguing that postmodern critique comprises three main elements; an anti-foundationalist concept of the subject and identity, the death of history and of notions of <b>teleology</b> and progress, {{and the death of}} metaphysics defined as the search for objective truth. Benhabib argues forcefully against these critical positions, holding that they undermine the bases upon which feminist politics can be founded, removing the possibility of agency, the sense of self-hood and the appropriation of women’s history in the name of an emancipated future. The denial of normative ideals removes the possibility for utopia, central for ethical thinking and democratic action.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} factors motivated people to propose other evolutionary mechanisms as alternatives to natural selection, some of them dating back before Darwin's Origin of Species. Natural selection, {{with its emphasis on}} death and competition, did not appeal to some naturalists because they felt it was immoral, and left little room for <b>teleology</b> or the concept of progress in the development of life. Some of these scientists and philosophers, like St. George Jackson Mivart and Charles Lyell, who came to accept evolution but disliked natural selection, raised religious objections. Others, such as Herbert Spencer, the botanist George Henslow (son of Darwin's mentor John Stevens Henslow also a botanist), and Samuel Butler, felt that evolution was an inherently progressive process that natural selection alone was insufficient to explain. Still others, including the American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, had an idealist perspective and felt that nature, including the development of life, followed orderly patterns that natural selection could not explain.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and <b>teleology.</b>|$|E

40|$|On {{the other}} hand [...] . dialectics: a {{sometimes}} social, sometimes materialist, sometimes psychological, but always political ontology that has offered the foundational logic for historico-geographical methodologies, rumbles on even while carrying the burden of a litany of criticisms levelled against its occasional idealisms, <b>teleologies,</b> totalities, binarisms, and, at times, its downright clunkiness. In spite of such objections, the onto-surjective `other-handed-ness' of dialectics, where relations and symmetries of the one hand grasp and shake the negations and contradictions of {{the other hand}}, continues to inspire new thought, direct novel research, and inform radical politics. Perhaps this is because, {{even in the face}} of growing allegiances to indeterminacy and alterity, the dialectical pairing never lets go: the chainlink of internal relations meets the one hand with the other, joined in constitutive proximity. Is there not, furthermore, something elegant about a mode of thought that finds theses within anti-theses and produces syntheses or, possibly, new fronts altogether; that tracks change not in circles but in spirals; and that anticipates all others, harmony with discord, rationality with emotion, man with God?

40|$|In the port-cities of Brazil {{during the}} nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a {{distinct}} form of combat-dancing emerged from the interaction of African, European and indigenous peoples. The acrobatic movements and characteristic music of this art {{have come to be}} called Capoeira. Today, the art of Capoeira has grown in popularity and groups of practitioners can be found scattered across the globe. Exploring how Capoeira practitioners invent markers of difference between separate groups, the first section of this article discusses musical markers of identity that reinforce in-group and out-group dynamics. At a separate but interconnected level of analysis, the second section investigates the global origins of Capoeira movement and disambiguates the commonly recounted origin myths promoted by teachers and scholars of this art. Practitioners frequently relate stories promoting the African origins of Capoeira. However, these stories obfuscate the global origins of Capoeira music and movement and conceal the various contributions to this vibrant and eclectic form of cultural expression. This article unpacks myth-making at two levels of analysis: (1) invented realities promoted by teachers in the horizontal transmission of Capoeira, and (2) the constructed <b>teleologies</b> about the vertical transmission of the art. Unpacking acts of myth-making at two levels of analysis reveals the interplay of discourse and repertoires of bodily expression. 8 page(s...|$|R
500|$|Angela Breitenbach, {{looking at}} the {{question}} of <b>teleology</b> in biology from a Kantian perspective, argues that <b>teleology</b> is important as [...] "a heuristic {{in the search for}} causal explanations of nature and... an inevitable analogical perspective on living beings." [...] In her view of Kant, <b>teleology</b> implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.|$|E
500|$|Statements which {{imply that}} nature has goals, for example where a species {{is said to}} do {{something}} [...] "in order to" [...] achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent <b>teleology.</b> Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences {{so that they do}} not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying <b>teleology,</b> even though that is not their intention. John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent <b>teleology</b> by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of current phonological theories the typological patterns of regressive place assimilation are treated as the consequence of interactions among constraints that have acoustical and perceptual <b>teleologies.</b> Little is known, however, about the articulatory patterns that underlie the typology of regressive place assimilation. Our current EMA study aims to investigate these patterns. Specifically, the timing and magnitude of tongue tip, lower lip, and tongue back movements of C 1 C 2 productions across word boundaries in German were studied. Data of one subject are reported here. The following articulatory factors were manipulated: manner of articulation of C 1, with C 1 being either /n / or /t/, and place of articulation of C 2, with C 2 being either /p / or /k/. Furthermore, lexical factors such as usage of the first word in the word pair and co-occurrence frequency were tested. The results provide evidence for a greater reduction of tongue tip movements in function words as compared to content words. Reduction of tongue tip movements was particularly likely in function words with /n#k/ clusters. In these items no tongue tip excursion was visible. In addition, this word pair had a high co-occurrence frequency. With regard to C 1 C 2 overlap in alveolar-labial clusters, only manner of articulation of C 1 but not word frequency played a role. 1...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{influential}} Afrikaans poets of the Dertiger movement, N. P. van Wyk Louw’s work was influenced significantly by modernism and the ideas associated with modernity. His highly canonised poems about animals and human-animal hybrids, Raka (1941), and “Die swart luiperd” (“The black leopard”) published in 1942 in Gestaltes en diere (Figurations and Animals), present compelling perspectives on the position of nonhuman animals in Afrikaans modernist poetry. In Raka Louw follows the resolute but futile attempts of the culturally refined leader Koki to protect his people against the contaminating effects of the insidious ape-man, Raka. Koki becomes the bearer of Louw’s modernist ideals for the maintenance of higher values. Yet, in his representation of Raka, he preserves something of a counter-image to Koki. As a hybrid creature Raka retains the potential to disrupt <b>teleologies</b> and to insert radical otherness in considerations of cultural excellence. Unlike Koki, the speaker in “Die swart luiperd” plunges into the destabilising depths opened by the gaze of the animal. The encounter with the black leopard in the jungle produces a form of insanity comparable to the experience of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. In “Die swart luiperd” Louw dares to break down the boundaries patrolled by Koki in Raka in an apparent rapprochement to the animal as a source of creative revitalisation and extension of consciousness.
