5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the northern hemisphere, but southerners {{were able to see}} the comet gradually fade from view {{during the second half of}} 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{defense was}} less {{statistically}} successful in 2010 <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> previous years, but the Hokies still {{led the nation}} in turnover margin, forcing 16 more turnovers than they gave away. Sophomore cornerback Jayron Hosley, a first-team All-ACC selection, {{led the nation in}} interceptions with eight, while Davon Morgan and Rashad Carmichael each had four. Tech's defense ranked 10th in the red zone, seven spots ahead of the Seminoles' defense in that respect. In total defense, the Hokies were 42nd, permitting an average of 349 yards per game. In scoring defense, Tech was third in the ACC, permitting 17.9points per game.|$|E

5|$|In the 1997 {{legislative}} elections the FN polled its best-ever {{result with}} 15.3% support in metropolitan France, confirming its {{position as the}} third most important political force in France. It also showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader, who {{decided not to run}} to focus on the 2002 presidential election. Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly (Toulon), thanks to a good communication director, it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies. The FN was arguably more influential now <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1986 with its 35 seats. While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch, in an unusual display of dissent, favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre-right following the left's victory, Le Pen rejected any such compromise. In the tenth FN national congress in 1997, Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen. Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor-elect, and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election.|$|E
5|$|MacMillan was in {{an awkward}} position. It was widely known that Ashton had been forced out, and many resented it. Company morale was lowered by an announcement, to which MacMillan and Field were party, that the two ballet {{companies}} would merge, with numerous job losses. The managerial side of the post was no more congenial to MacMillan <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Berlin, and some felt that his creative work suffered during his seven-year term. His expansion of Anastasia into a three-act version (1971) and the other full-length work from this period, Manon (1974), divided opinion, receiving fiercely adverse reviews as well as laudatory ones. His Joplin ballet Elite Syncopations (1974) and Requiem (1976) were immediately successful and have been regularly revived. The latter was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Cranko, who had died suddenly in 1973. It was premiered at Stuttgart, because as with Song of the Earth the Royal Opera House board thought the chosen music – Fauré's Requiem – inappropriate for a ballet. The work was not given at Covent Garden until 1983.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{recorded}} {{population for}} Shapinsay is 974, in 1881. Since then, {{the population of}} the island has steadily declined; {{less than a third of}} that number was recorded in the 2001 census. The rate of absolute population loss was lower in the last decades of the 20th century <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the first half of that century. In 2001, Shapinsay had a population of 300, a decline of 6.8% from 322 in 1991. This was greater than the population decline for Orkney overall in the same period, which was 1.9%. However, the loss in population on Shapinsay was less than that experienced by most Orkney islands, most of which experienced declines of more than 10%. The number of persons per hectare on Shapinsay was 0.1, similar to the 0.2 persons per hectare across Orkney. At the time of the 2011 census the usually resident population had increased to 307. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|The nearly {{decade and}} a half of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by 1603 {{the core}} of the troupe was in some respects younger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1594. Bryan, Pope, and Kempe, {{veterans}} of the 1580s, had left, and the remaining sharers (with the probable exception of Phillips), were roughly within a decade of 40.|$|E
25|$|After Dunstan's {{resignation}} {{and a brief}} Liberal government under Ian Macfarlan, Cain again became premier on 21 November 1945. Labor's lower house parliamentary position was much better <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> 1943, since the 1945 state elections had given Labor 31 seats to the Country Party's 18 and the Liberals' 13, with three independents.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} sector, contributing 6.5% to the city’s {{economy in}} 2010, was a growing sector before the recession, {{aided by a}} large transport and infrastructure program.

25|$|The Signal Corps' {{role in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898 and the {{subsequent}} Philippine Insurrection was on a grander scale <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Civil War. In addition to visual signaling, including heliograph, the corps supplied telephone and telegraph wire lines and cable communications, fostered the use of telephones in combat, employed combat photography, and renewed the use of balloons. Shortly after the war, the Signal Corps constructed the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) {{also known as the}} Alaska Communications System (ACS), introducing the first wireless telegraph in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, it was {{reported}} that the Trent was cleaner <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the last 70–80 years, and that episodic incidents of pollution had also reduced considerably since the 1970s. The river remains vulnerable to these pollution events, such as the one that occurred in October 2009 when an accidental release of cyanide from a factory into the sewer system in Stoke-on-Trent, affected the treatment works at Strongford. This resulted in the release of raw sewage and the chemical into the river, killing thousands of fish, and posing a health risk to river users as far south as Burton.|$|E

By 1928 BSCP leaders decided {{that the only way}} to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.|$|E

25|$|Community and {{equality}} are mutually reinforcing... Social capital and economic inequality moved in tandem {{through most of}} the twentieth century. In terms of the distribution of wealth and income, America in the 1950s and 1960s was more egalitarian <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> more than a century... hose same decades were also the high point of social connectedness and civic engagement. Record highs in equality and social capital coincided. Conversely, the last third of the twentieth century was a time of growing inequality and eroding social capital... The timing of the two trends is striking: somewhere around 1965–70 America reversed course and started becoming both less just economically and less well connected socially and politically.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to heavy}} pollution, the East River is {{dangerous}} to people who fall in or attempt to swim in it, although as of mid-2007 the water was cleaner <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> decades. As of 2010, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) categorizes the East River as Use Classification I, meaning it is safe for secondary contact activities such as boating and fishing. According to the marine sciences section of the DEP, the channel is swift, with water moving as fast as four knots, just {{as it does in}} the Hudson River {{on the other side of}} Manhattan. That speed can push casual swimmers out to sea. A few people drown in the waters around New York City each year.|$|E
25|$|On 11 March, {{the leaders}} of the investigation, headed by Mikhail Fetisov, held a meeting to discuss {{progress}} made in the manhunt. Fetisov was under intense pressure from the public, the press, and the Ministry of the Interior in Moscow to solve the case. The intensity of the manhunt in the years up to 1984 had receded to a degree between 1985 and 1987, when Chikatilo had committed only three murders investigators had conclusively linked to the killer—all killed by 1986. However, by March 1990, a further six victims had been linked to the killer. In addition, following the introduction of greater media freedom as a result of glasnost, the Soviet news media was much less repressed <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> {{the early years of the}} manhunt and as such, devoted extensive publicity to the case. Fetisov had also noted laxity in some areas of the investigation and warned that people would be fired if the killer was not caught soon.|$|E
