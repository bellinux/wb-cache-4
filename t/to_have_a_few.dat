5|$|Salim {{rebels and}} amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is {{sentence}}d to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as {{it was she who}} brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a minute}} of Chelsea kicking off the match, Le Saux was booked for a {{challenge}} on Lauren. Arsenal were awarded the first corner {{of the game in}} the eight minutes later, but nothing came out of it as Adams fouled Mario Melchiot in the penalty box. The opening half-hour was mostly event-free, with neither side dominating and few goalscoring opportunities fashioned. Chelsea adopted a tactic of narrowing the pitch and using little width, which sedated Arsenal's typically fluent football. Guðjohnsen tested the Arsenal defence by making dangerous runs, but one in the 12th minute was ruled as a foul. Arsenal's first chance came a minute later when Henry used his pace to run towards the Chelsea goal. He set up Sylvain Wiltord, whose shot was blocked by Desailly. Vieira struggled to match the energetic performance of his opponent Frank Lampard and in the 17th minute Vieira's careless pass was intercepted by the England midfielder. Lampard decided to take a shot, forcing a save from Seaman. Four minutes later Vieira started a move which almost gave Arsenal the lead. A ball over the top found Bergkamp in the Chelsea area, but he guided his header just wide. In the 26th minute Vieira was awarded the final's first yellow card for a foul on Guðjohnsen. A confrontation between Melchiot and Fredrik Ljungberg occurred in the 33rd minute, but referee Mike Riley decided not to brandish a card, instead choosing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words with the players. Campbell's failed clearance a minute later presented Guðjohnsen with goal-scoring opportunity, but he hit his shot directly at Seaman. As the match drew nearer to half-time, Arsenal started to find their rhythm and played their usual passing game. They created the best chance of the first half, when a cross from Wiltord found Lauren, who headed the ball just over the crossbar. Hasselbaink, largely ineffective as he was blighted with injury, combined with Guðjohnsen to split open the Arsenal defence, but the move was halted as Riley called offside.|$|E

Later on Lim ventured into scrap-metal and hardware trading. When the Japanese Occupation ended, there was an urgent demand for heavy machinery for resumed operations in mines and rubber plantations. Lim seized the opportunity and engaged in second-hand machinery trading, making his first fortune.|$|E

The idea of her {{crawling}} through her bed into this other world made it fantastical and have creative licence <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> surreal elements. The bed scene was made up of thirty or so mattresses inside a tent of giant silk. The light was amazing, and once inside the bed set it felt so calming and peaceful.

Long's successor, John Breaux, also a U.S. representative at the time from Crowley, however, defeated Moore in the general election. Moore had led in the nonpartisan blanket primary.

25|$|Meanwhile, the NWA's renowned {{and highly}} {{successful}} territory system was slowly dying, with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) becoming {{the center of}} the entire NWA. While the WWF had their major stars at almost all of their shows, the NWA could only manage <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of its stars at one show at a time, so as to promote the product in every territory. After the WWF gained huge dominance with Wrestlemania, Crockett responded {{to the success of the}} WWF and successfully acquired time slots on TBS, and would continue to buy out NWA promotions between 1985 and 1987 as well. The advent of nationwide television also weakened the system. Wrestlers could no longer travel to a new market and establish a new persona, since fans there already knew who they were. Meanwhile, McMahon took advantage of this phenomenon by purchasing promotions all over the continent, in order to produce a widely popular nationwide television program and make the WWF the only viewing choice.|$|E
500|$|Nagarjuna {{added that}} the film's {{characters}} would reborn with no special purpose unlike other reincarnation films like Janaki Ramudu (1988), Arundhati (2009) and Magadheera (2009). Saran {{said in an interview}} that the film basically has a family-oriented theme and is about falling in love with [...] "small, little things that you sort of don't see every day, but are really, really important". Unlike other reincarnation based films, the film's story develops two separate themes— the relationship between reborn lovers, but also the relationship between reborn parents and their children. Naga Chaitanya acknowledged in an interview with The Hindu that the film's script might seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> overly-convenient coincidences, but felt that Kumar's detailing in every scene made the script believable.|$|E

Ellen Bury's throat was not cut, and only relatively shallow cuts were made to her abdomen. The identity of the Whitechapel murderer is unknown, and over one hundred suspects, in addition to Bury, have been proposed. While some Ripper writers consider Bury a more likely culprit {{than many of the}} other suspects, other writers dismiss the theory because, [...] "as happens all too frequently in this field, the theorizing appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> disturbing leaps of logic as well as mere anecdotes used as evidence." ...|$|E

[...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is."

500|$|The band {{began to}} grow {{suspicious}} that Secor was keeping the money from selling the tape, and contacted their lawyer – Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. The group informed as Escalante that they believed [...] "someone's bootlegging it," [...] and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Escalante's label, Kung Fu, to re-release Buddha on compact disc. The band had told Secor to not sell any more copies of the tape, but they held suspicions that he had anyway. Anonymously, Escalante ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. The band asserted {{that they were not}} receiving royalties for these sales. [...] "I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of tapes that I had of Buddha," [...] said Secor in 2001. [...] "It was about 25. The tapes sold for five bucks, and I gave them half of what their profit would be. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> to give to people and to have on hand."

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Opening of the Fifth Seal served as an inspiration for the early Cubist works of Pablo Picasso, especially Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which mirrors the expressionistic angularity of the painting.

His final major-league appearance came on September 12 against the Cincinnati Reds; he came into a tied game in the ninth and promptly gave up three runs without retiring a batter, taking the loss (coincidentally, the last batter McLain ever faced in the major leagues was Pete Rose, who also was involved in a gambling scandal years later).
