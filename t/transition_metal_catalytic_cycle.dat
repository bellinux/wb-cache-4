Our desire is to develop an efficient, versatile and highly atom efficient process that offers an environmentally sound and cost effective alternative for the synthetic and industrial chemist to consider over current, well established methodologies. We have conceived a <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> mediated hypothetical <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle,</b> the basis of which is a series of ligand interconversions effected by cycloaddition chemistry. This thesis represents a feasibility study into our hypothetical <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Chapter 1 introduces the established methodologies, our hypothetical <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> and gives a review of the most relevant chemistry. Chapter 2 details our results. Particular attention is paid to relevant concepts in catalysis and <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> chemistry. Chapter 2. 1 reports our experiences in synthesising ketenes. An efficient synthesis of diphenylketene sup 1 sup 3 C sub 2 is described. Our hypothetical <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle</b> requires a chemoselective reaction and Chapter 2. 2 describes our preliminary work investigating the feasibility of this. Chapter 2. 3 describes the synthesis of [PPN][Cp*MO sub 3] (M=Mo, W) and Chapter 2. 4 describes the reactivity of these complexes with ketenes and provides a unique experimental insight into the stepwise cycloaddition mechanism of diphenylketene with [PPN][Cp*WO sub 3).

The studies revealed that the large free-energy released upon carbon dimer addition {{to the edge of}} the nanotube structure is responsible for the extrusive driving force of the growth of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a most promising material for use in molecular electronics. Their unique conducting properties enable the manufacture of devices such as field effect transistors, field emission displays, and single elec-tron transistors. In the microelectronics industry, CNTs are commonly grown using chemical vapor deposition in the presence of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> nanopar-ticles (TMNP).

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{catalytic}} synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles were studied by combining atomistic simulations: reactive molecular dynamics (RMD), density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), with in situ high-resolution environmental transmission electron microscope (ETEM) imaging. SWCNTs are carbon allotropes with applications in many technological fields owing to their exceptional properties that depend on their structural features. Understanding the nucleation and growth of SWCNTs can provide the tools to devise strategies to control their structure from the synthesis, thus allowing further {{development and implementation of}} nanotube-based technologies. The interactions of supported and unsupported carbon-philic and noble <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalytic</b> nanoparticles with adsorbed or dissolved carbon and nanotube seeds were investigated using DFT and AIMD simulations. These studies revealed differences in solubility and nucleation mechanisms on the different particles due to interactions with added C and the support. A cooperative nucleation mechanism was demonstrated using ETEM measurements and DFT, in which different facets of the catalyst with stronger/weaker adhesion facilitate nucleation/lift-off of the seed to form the nanotube. ETEM and RMD of supported Co catalyst during nanotube growth revealed structural changes in the nanoparticle and the coexistence of metal and carbide regions of fluctuating size directly affecting the growth rate and catalyst structure...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} a computationally inexpensive method for modeling the high-temperature reaction dynamics of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> catalyzed reactions we have developed a ReaxFF reactive force field in which the parameters are fitted to a substantial quantum mechanics (QM) training set, containing full reaction pathways for relevant reactions. In this paper we apply this approach to reactions involving carbon materials plus Co, Ni, and Cu atoms. We find that ReaxFF reproduces the QM reaction data with good accuracy while also reproducing the binding characteristics of Co, Ni, and Cu atoms to hydrocarbon fragments. To demonstrate the applicability of ReaxFF we performed high-temperature (1500 K) molecular dynamics simulations on a nonbranched all-carbon feedstock in the presence and absence of Co, Ni, and Cu atoms. We find {{that the presence of}} Co and Ni leads to substantial amounts of branched carbon atoms, leading eventually to the formation of carbon-nanotube-like species. In contrast, we find that under the same simulation conditions Cu leads to very little branching and leads to products with no nanotube character. In the absence of metals no branching is observed at all. These results suggest that Ni and Co catalyze the production of nanotube-like species whereas Cu does not. This is in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that ReaxFF can provide a useful and computational tractable tool for studying the dynamics of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalytic</b> chemistry...|$|R

40|$|Catalysis {{plays an}} {{important}} part in our society. Numerous <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts have been developed which can convert many different substrates {{in a wide range of}} reactions. Catalysis also {{plays an important}} role in nature and therefore special catalysts, enzymes, have evolved over time. Enzymes are tremendously efficient giving high yields and selectivities both regio and chemical but have a limited substrate and reaction scope. It was speculated that by combining the two, an ideal catalyst can be obtained. We planned to achieve this by introducing a <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> the <b>catalytic</b> centre, into the chiral environment of a double helical oligonucleotide. The <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> were introduced by coordinating them to a ligand which was located in the chiral environment of a double helix. The ligand was either covalently bound (Chapter 2) or non-covalently bound (Chapter 3) to the oligonucleotide. For the covalent approach a phosphine ligand was chosen. A nucleoside was modified with an alkyne to which a phosphine moiety could be coupled via the copper catalysed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition. The modified nucleoside was incorporated into an oligonucleotide before attempting to attach the phosphine moiety. The monomer was used as a ligand in allylic substitution and hydroformylation. In the non-covalent approach polyamide minor groove binders were functionalised with an amine linker. Phosphine moieties were connected via amide bond formation. Although the coupling worked effortlessly the phosphines oxidised during purification therefore dienes were also investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{replacement}} of hazardous solvents and {{the utilization of}} catalytic processes are two key points of the green chemistry movement, so aqueous organometallic catalytic processes are of great interest in this context. Nevertheless, these processes require not only the use of water-soluble ligands such as phosphanes to solubilise the <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> in water, but also the use of mass transfer agents to increase the solubility of organic substrates in water. In this context, phosphanes based on a cyclodextrin skeleton are an interesting alternative since these compounds can simultaneously act as mass transfer agents and as coordinating species towards <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> For twenty years, various cyclodextrin-functionalized phosphanes have been described in the literature. Nevertheless, while their coordinating properties towards <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> and their <b>catalytic</b> properties were fully detailed, their mass transfer agent properties were much less discussed. As these mass transfer agent properties are directly linked to {{the availability of the}} cyclodextrin cavity, the aim of this review is to demonstrate that the nature of the reaction solvent {{and the nature of the}} linker between cyclodextrin and phosphorous moieties can deeply influence the recognition properties.

40|$|Transition metal-catalyzed C-C bond forming {{reactions}} involving C-H bond activation {{have been}} shown to be effective methods for functionalization of unreactive compounds. Since Murai 2 ̆ 7 s pioneering work on ruthenium-catalyzed regioselective arene-to-alkene coupling reactions, a number of well-defined, late <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts {{have been shown}} to mediate regioseletive C-C bond forming reaction involving C-H bond activation. Recently, late <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> complexes have also been found to catalyze the regioselective coupling reaction of nitrogen containing compounds with alkenes as well as sp 3 bond insertions and oxidative coupling reaction of aimdes. The catalytic C-C bond forming reaction involving C-H bond activation would provide simple and atom economic pathways for making functionalized molecules. Although there are many examples of stoichiometric reaction of aromatic C-H bond activation with <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> compounds, <b>catalytic</b> C-H bond activation reactions via catalytic system have been rarely employed in organic synthesis. An efficient catalytic conjugate addition reaction protocol has been developed for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted olefin products. The cationic ruthenium-hydride complex was found to be an effective catalyst for coupling reaction with á,â-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and simple alkenes. The kinetic and spectroscopic data are consistent with three different mechanistic pathways depending on substrate employed. The reaction of an á,â-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with simple olefins predominantly gave the tetrasubstituted olefin products. The mechanistic studies suggest that the olefin insertion into an á,â-unsaturated carbonyl substrate is the rate-limiting step for conjugate addition reaction. On the other hand, the coupling reaction of á-methyl á,â-unsaturated cinnamide with aromatic alkenes gave oxidative coupling products. The kinetic and spectroscopic studies support the different mechanistic pathway, which involves the rate-limiting vinyl C-H activation step, in comparison with the conjugate addition reaction. This synthetic methodology promises to provide a straightforward route to the valuable organic compounds such as tetrasubstituted olefins which are difficult to synthesize by using traditional synthetic methods...|$|R

It also plays {{a central role in the}} developing renewable energy field of solar-fuels generation by providing both the protons and electrons needed to generate fuels such as H_ 2 or reduced hydrocarbons from CO_ 2. To improve these processes, it is necessary to expand the fundamental understanding of catalytically active species at low overpotential, which will further the development of novel electrocatalysts with high activity and durability. In this context, performing experimental investigations of the electrocatalysts under realistic working regimes, i. e. under operando conditions, is of crucial importance. Here, we study a highly active quinary <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> oxide-based OER electrocatalyst by means of operando ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy performed at the solid/liquid interface.

40|$|In {{organic and}} polymer {{chemistry}} a catalyst {{is often used}} to enhance reaction speed, selectivity and/or make milder reaction condition feasible. Many <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> possess <b>catalytic</b> properties and are frequently used in organic reactions. The drawback is that a catalyst is not consumed during the reaction and remains unchanged in the product as a contaminant. Especially when using a <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> complex as a catalyst, even the smallest amount can lead to unwanted characteristics (such as colouring, smell, toxicity,…). Removal of the catalyst is therefore necessary, but not always easy. In this work, a new type of macromolecular ligand structure for a copper catalyst, which retains the activity and selectivity of the homogeneous catalysis and allows a rapid and efficient separation of the catalyst and the product, has been developed. The polyamine poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) was used as basis for a polymeric ligand for a copper catalyst. To improve the solubility in organic solvents and electronic properties of the macroligands, PEI was alkylated. These modified polyamines could be easily crosslinked into an insoluble network. The polyamine network functions as a solid support as well as a ligand for the copper catalyst. In this way, the use of an inert support material is avoided and a high theoretical loading capacity is achieved. In a second stage, these newly synthesized macroligand structures were combined with Cu(I) and used for two copper catalyzed reaction that are currently frequently used in several domains of polymer chemistry: atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and the copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), an example of the so-called ‘click’ chemistry. For both reactions the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with these Cu(I) /macroligand catalytic complexes have been evaluated. Furthermore, the reusability and efficient removal of the heterogeneous catalyst was examined...|$|R

This 3 -day event welcomed some 90 delegates from over 20 countries. Over 60 contributions were presented, 26 oral and 38 poster contributions. The workshop was divided in three session days, each one focussing {{on the use of}} one of the three <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> elements Fe, Cu and Co. Each day, two recognized specialists presented plenary lectures and a round table discussion completed each session. Together, the sessions provided a very good idea {{of the state of the}} art of the thriving field of combining <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalytic</b> centers in porous materials. The last decade research in this field has become an important area from the viewpoint of environmental catalysis and also green chemistry. In his opening lecture, Weckhuysen set the framework for the workshop with some recent appealing examples of his own and other researchers’ work. The contributions to the workshop covered many aspects related to catalytic applications of these materials including the abatement of nitrous oxide, NOx control and selective oxidation of organics. During the 1 st day, lectures by Bell, Pirngruber and Renken focussed on the intriguing kinetics of nitrous oxide decomposition over Fe/ZSM- 5 which appear to be complex. The complexity of this catalytic system is also evident from the large effort put into precise catalyst synthesis and especially detailed characterization of the nature of the <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions occluded in the porous environment. Engaged and vivid discussions after the lectures (which made the original time schedule at most indicative) and during the round table led to the realization that fundamental understanding of the ‘active site’ in Fe/ZSM- 5 is still lacking. Evidently, this calls for the use of sophisticated characterization techniques as was apparent from the attention for this aspect during lectures of De Groot, Taboada, Lázár and Volodin. The plenary lecture by Zecchina on the 2 nd day offered a fine overview of the use of probe molecules in infrared spectroscopy over Cu-containing porous materials. Kazansky showed by combined IR experiments and DFT calculations that hydrogen and ethane form unusual surface complexes with Cu+ species. The trend to combine experiment and theory was also evident from the plenary lecture presented by Berthomieu. Groothaert showed the impact that operando spectroscopy studies can have in our understanding of the dynamic processes occurring during catalysis. In this session, Jobson (Volvo Technology) announced that a Cu-containing catalyst is now close to commercialization for NOx control in diesel engines. The final day provided a mix of lectures focussing on cobalt with a review by Busca and several contributions focussing on the use of combinations of metals. Dong showed that the use of CoAlPOs in supercritical carbon dioxide holds promise for selective cyclohexane oxidation. The workshop ended with a summary by Kapteijn, who but also formulated the most important burning questions that remain to be answered. The contributions in this special issue include work carried out in the field of synthesis and characterization of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> cations in porous materials as well as the application of these materials in industrial and environmental settings. We believe that the 19 papers in this issue represent a good overview of the state of the art of the catalytic applications of the elements iron, copper and cobalt in micro- and mesoporous materials.

Seminal studies have shown that by alloying a noble metal such as palladium to a <b>transition</b> <b>metal,</b> it is possible to tune the electronic and/or bifunctional properties enabling substantial ORR performance to be achieved, thereby designing a costly catalyst. Herein, we address and discuss new findings from deeper ORR investigations at palladium-based nanostructures in an alkaline medium.

PdFe/C from bromide anion exchange (BAE) enables 40 and 4 -fold enhancement in terms of exchange current density and kinetic current density and ca. 100 mV gains compared to the polyol microwave-assisted method. After 20 000 cycles of accelerated potential cycling test (APCT), our findings indicate that the present PdM/C bimetallics outperform, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, most of the data reported for ORR in alkaline media for Pdbased <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> The improved <b>catalytic</b> performances are assigned to the absence of any organic contaminants or protective ligands on their surface and their relatively heterogeneous character comprising nanoalloys and nanowire oxides...|$|R

A similar approach also permits catalysis of Barton–McCombie reductions by Bu 3 SnH...|$|R
40|$|Power {{conversion}} efficiencies {{of plastic}} solar cells depend strongly on the molecular weight {{characteristics of the}} semiconducting polymers used for their fabrication. The synthesis of these materials typically relies on <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> mediated <b>catalytic</b> reactions. In many instances, the ideal structures cannot be attained because of deficiencies in these reactions, {{particularly when it comes}} to being able to achieve high number average molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. Another important conjugated polymer structure of interest is one in which a single functional group is attached at the end group of the chain. Such systems would be ideal for modifying surface properties at interfaces and for labeling biomolecular probes used in fluorescent biosensors. To respond to the challenges above, our efforts have centered on the design of homogenous <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> complexes that are easy to prepare and effective in carrying out living, or quasi-living, condensative chain polymerization reactions. The key mechanistic challenge for the success of this reaction is to force the insertion of one monomer unit at a time via a process that involves migration of the transition metal-containing fragment to one terminus of the polymer chain. Chain growth characteristics are therefore favored when the metal does not dissociate from the newly formed reductive elimination product. We have proposed that dissociation is disfavored by the formation of a Ï-complex, in which the metal can sample various locations of the electronically delocalized framework, a process that we term âring-walkingâ, and find the functionality where oxidative addition takes place. Success has been achieved in the nickel-mediated cross coupling reaction of Grignard reagents with aromatic halides by using bromo[1, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) ethane]phenylnickel. This reagent can yield poly(thiophene) s (one of the most widely used type of polymer in plastic solar cells) with excellent stereoregularity and molecular weight distributions with polydispersities that are consistent with a living polymerization sequence. Another important objective of this program concerned the use of these new catalysts and improved mechanistic insight for the synthesis of specific polymeric materials with prespecified properties...|$|R
40|$|Abstract DNAzymes (or {{catalytic}} DNA) are cell-free biomolecular recognition tools with target recognition sequences for charged molecules such as metal ions, antibiotics, and pharmaceuticals. In this study, {{using in}} vitro selection, large populations (e. g., 1015) of random DNA sequences {{were used as}} the raw material for the selection of “catalytic or functional molecules” for Hg 2 + and As 5 +. From a random pool of 45 -nt (Pool-A) and 35 -nt (Pool-B) templates, we isolated RNA-cleaving catalytic Hg 2 +- and As 5 +- active DNAzymes, respectively. After eight cycles of selection and amplification wihin Pool A, sequences were enriched with a 54 % cleavage efficiency against Hg 2 +. Similarly, Pool B was found to catalyze ca. 18 % cleavage efficiency against As 5 + after 10 cycles of repeated selection and amplification. The M-fold software analysis resulted in sequences in the two active pools being dominated by AATTCCGTAGGTCCAGTG and ATCTCCTCCTGTTC functional motifs for Hg 2 +- and As 5 +-based catalysis, respectively. These DNAzymes {{were found to have}} higher activity in the presence of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions compared to alkaline earth metal ions. A maximum cleavage rate of 2. 7 [*]min− 1 for Hg 2 + was found to be highest in our study at a saturating concentration of 500 [*]μM. Results demonstrate that DNAzymes are capable of selectively binding <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions, and <b>catalytic</b> rates are at par with most Mg 2 +-dependent nucleic acid enzymes under similar conditions, and indicate their potential as metal species-specific biosensors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{utilized}} quantum chemical calculations coupled with numerical and analytical models to predict macroscopic observables associated with catalytic and photocatalytic processes on <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces. All the predicted macroscopic observables were validated based on experimental measurements. The theoretical models developed here provide atomic scale {{insights into the}} mechanisms of catalytic and photocatalytic processes and suggest areas for future research {{in the design of}} novel catalysts. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we focused on understanding characteristics that control performance of late <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> for the <b>catalytic</b> reduction of CO 2 by H 2. By coupling Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with mean-field microkinetic models we found that on Ru-based catalysts CHO* dissociation to CH* and O* is the rate determining step (RDS) for CH 4 formation, while CO* desorption is the RDS for CO production. The affinity of late <b>transition</b> <b>metals</b> for O* adsorption was identified as an effective predictor of selectivity between CO and CH 4 production on late <b>transition</b> <b>metals,</b> which matches well with previous experimental observations. We extended this study by developing an analytical approach, called the “scaled degree of rate control” (S-DoRC), to systematically identify rate and selectivity determining steps for reactions on late <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> In the second part of this dissertation we coupled ΔSCF-DFT calculations with a Hamiltonian-based inelastic scattering model to understand the detailed mechanisms of photocatalysis on metal surfaces. We focused on understanding experimentally observed behaviors of photon-driven CO and NO desorption and O diffusion reactions on the Pt(111) surface. The developed models that accurately predicted previous wavelength-dependent and time-resolved measurements and suggested approaches to control selectivity in photon driven reactions on metal surfaces. In the last part of this dissertation we coupled extensive DFT calculations with Wulff constructions to understand the process of CO-induced reconstruction of Pt nanoparticle catalysts, which is critical to catalytic converters. By correlating atom-resolved imaging via in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), with in-situ quantitative, site-specific infrared (IR) spectroscopy and DFT based Wulff-constructions we demonstrated that at high CO coverage, Pt nanoparticles undergo a facet selective reconstruction where (100) facets reconstruct to stepped vicinal surfaces, while (111) facets are stable. This is the first example of an atomic scale and quantitative view of adsorbate induced metal nanoparticle surface reconstruction at realistic conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{suprafacial}} 2 + 2 reaction at <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> centers is presented. It is demonstrated that this reaction is allowed and proceeds with {{a low activation energy}} if the reacting transition metal-to-substituent bond is covalent, nonpolar, and has a large component at transition nickel d-orbital character. These chains are evinced by examination of 2 s + 2 s reactions at M-H bonds. Those systems in which M can use d orbitals show lower barriers to the 2 s + 2 s reaction than those in which M cannot use d orbitals. The importance of the electronic structure of the metal-to-substituent bond is highlighted by a study of dichorotitanacyclopropane. This molecule, being a metallacyclopropane, can undergo 2 s + 2 s reactions which one unavailable to a simple olefin. Studies concerning the importance of 2 s + 2 s reactivity in the organic chemistry of nickel, and in the Ziegler-Natta polymerization of simple olefins are presented. It is suggested that the principle of maximum bonding (the Woodward-Hoffmann rules) implies the conservation of <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> covalency in low-energy <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Gold, {{the archetypal}} “noble metal”, {{used to be}} {{considered}} of little interest in catalysis. It {{is now clear that}} this was a misconception, and a multitude of gold-catalysed transformations has been reported. However, one consequence of the long-held view of gold as inert metal is that its organometallic chemistry contains many “unknowns”, and <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycles</b> devised to explain gold's reactivity draw largely on analogies with other <b>transition</b> <b>metals.</b> How realistic are such mechanistic assumptions? In the last few years a number of key compound classes have been discovered that can provide some answers.

As a result, various spectroscopic techniques are inevitably used to characterize and interrogate the mechanistic details of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cycle.</b> Where paramagnetic centres are involved, ranging from <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> ions to defects and radicals, EPR spectroscopy is without doubt the technique of choice.

40|$|A primary factor {{influencing}} catalyticversus stoichiometric behaviour {{of molecular}} main group species in homogeneous dehydrocoupling reactions is the redox {{stability of the}} metal centre. Thus, only {{in the case of}} redox-stable <b>metals</b> has <b>catalytic</b> behaviour so far been observed, through genuinely hydrogenic coupling (E–H + E′–H → E–E′ + H 2), whereas for redox-unstable metals oxidative dehydrocoupling is seen (E–H + E′–H → E–E′ + 2 H+ + 2 e). The mechanisms of catalytic P–H/P–H and B–H/N–H dehydrocoupling involving main group systems are closely related to d 0 <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> counterparts and produce a similar range of products, although the main group systems reported so far are not as active as the most active <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> catalysts...|$|R
