50|$|Switching power {{supplies}} must {{pay more attention}} to the skin effect because it is a source of power loss. At 500 kHz, the skin depth in copper is about 0.003 in - a dimension smaller than the <b>typical</b> <b>wires</b> used in a power supply. The effective resistance of conductors increases, because current concentrates near the surface of the conductor and the inner portion carries less current than at low frequencies.|$|R

To this end, two novel approaches are presented, one proposing relay transmissions with multiple antennas based on the notion of data splitting and a second one addressing resource allocation with distributed scheduling. A proof-of-concept hardware prototype was developed as a means to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed concepts and algorithms and investigate the performance benefits and complexity requirements. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R

Results of computations for a <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> array are presented for total and spectral turbulence measurements. Although the actual errors are slightly underestimated due to the simplifying assumptions used to reduce the computational effort, {{it is found that}} the wire length and separation effect is very significant. The analysis does not require complete correlation or spectral functions of the flow and includes the effect of nonuniform wire sensitivity. Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{mobility}} of a quasi-one-dimensional (Q 1 D) electron system {{in the presence of}} an axial magnetic field at low temperatures. We consider the mobility limits for remote-impurity scattering, homogeneous-background scattering, interface-roughness scattering, and alloy-disorder scattering mechanisms. For a system in which all carriers are in the lowest subband, the electron-impurity interaction is modelled for the above cases, and analytic expressions are derived. Calculations appropriate for a GaAs Q 1 D structure are presented for <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> radius R, electron density N, impurity density Ni, and applied magnetic field B...|$|R
50|$|The packet {{drop attack}} can be {{frequently}} deployed to attack wireless ad hoc networks. Because wireless networks {{have a much}} different architecture {{than that of a}} <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> network, a host can broadcast that it has the shortest path towards a destination. By doing this, all traffic will be directed to the host that has been compromised, and the host is able to drop packets at will. Also over a mobile ad hoc network, hosts are specifically vulnerable to collaborative attacks where multiple hosts will become compromised and deceive the other hosts on the network.|$|R

An experimental investigation is described in which the static stiffness curve, hysteresis curves, phase plane trajectories, and frequency response curves are obtained. A semiempirical model having nonlinear stiffness, nth-power velocity damping, and variable Coulomb friction damping is developed, {{and the results are}} compared to experimental data. Several observations and conclusions are made about the dynamic phenomena in a <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> rope vibration isolation system based on the experimental and semiempirical results...|$|R

30|$|RFID {{technology}} raises significant privacy {{issues regarding}} the traceability concerns. While {{a person could}} be traced by tracking his/her mobile phone through a carrier, such a method is no more useful once the phone is turned off. However, {{this is not the}} case for someone carrying an RFID gadget. First of all, most users are not aware that they are carrying RFID tags. In fact, even if they know it, tags could not be turned off in general and worse, it automatically responds to queries via radio signals. Therefore, in RFID systems, the attack scenarios and accompanying countermeasures are quite different than the <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> or wireless systems.|$|R
40|$|Integrating {{appliances}} in {{the home}} through a wired network often proves to be impractical: routing cables is usually difficult, changing the network structure afterward even more so, and portable devices can only be connected at fixed connection points. Wireless networks are not the answer either: batteries have to be regularly replaced or changed, and what they add to the device's size and weight might be disproportionate for smaller appliances. In Pin&Play, we explore a design space in between <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> and wireless networks, investigating the use of surfaces to network objects that are attached to it.

Distributions of critical currents (Ic) in the longitudinal direction were improved in most wires routinely fabricated under optimized process. A <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> showed Ic of 460 A/cm at 77 K and self-field, about 200 A/cm at 65 K and 3 T and about 300 A/cm at 50 K and 5 T. In addition, further high Ic values over 800 A/cm were also obtained in thick films.

40|$|Abstract- In today’s {{demanding}} and competitive business environment, {{the need to}} collect, interpret and act on real-time data plays an increasingly vital role. But data collection using <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> sensor networks has always been expensive to install and maintain, and limited in its reach. This difficulty can be overcome by using tiny, wireless smart sensors. This Wireless System is a monitoring device that combines a maser controller, one or more sensors, and a radio for transmitting and receiving information. A typical application scenario is scattering a hundred of sensors around a green house or a building or around a hospital to monitor temperature or humidity, track patient movements, or inform of disasters, such as earthquakes. In the military, they can perform as a remote sensor chip to track enemy movements, detect poisonous gas or radioactivity...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{thermoelectric}} {{data have}} been determined for four thermocouple combinations used below the ice point: commercial types E, K, and T {{and the special}} combination of KP vs Au- 0. 07 at. % Fe. Power series coefficients necessary to generate E = f(T) data for these combinations are given. In addition, extensive tests were carried out to ascertain the variability between materials from different manufacturers. <b>Typical</b> <b>wires</b> processed for low-temperature usage often have slightly thermoelectric properties (up to 1 %) from those, nominally identical, wires made for high-temperature applications. Generally, type E is the most satisfactory standardized commercial combination. The Au- 0. 07 at. % Fe material has been examined in particular detail, {{because it is not}} yet an ISA standard material. It has excellent sensitivity in the liquid helium/liquid hydrogen temperature range and a nearly linear thermovoltage at higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{embedded}} systems {{are becoming increasingly}} vulnerable to attack as they are connected to external networks. Unfortunately, they often have no built-in authentication capability. Multicast authentication mechanisms required to secure embedded networks must function within the unique constraints of these systems, {{making it difficult to}} apply previously proposed schemes. We propose an authentication approach using message authentication codes which exploits the time-triggered nature of many {{embedded systems}} by putting only a few authentication code bits in each message, and by requiring authentication to be confirmed by the correct reception of multiple messages. This approach can work for both state transition commands and reactive control messages, and enables a tradeoff among per-message authentication cost, application-level latency, and the probability of induced system failure. Authentication parameters can be tuned on a per-message basis while satisfying <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> embedded network constraints...|$|R

30|$|The present work {{differs from}} [17, 18] in the following: (a) {{the number of}} samples that can be omitted by the {{sub-sampling}} process is theoretically extended by 50 % (up to 3 N/ 8), since additional DFT properties are exploited, (b) the operations of both the IFFT and the FFT that can be deactivated during the sub-sampling mode are specified in detail, (c) {{a number of new}} IFFT input packet structures, that do not depend on the position of the pilots and the guard symbols, are introduced, allowing the use of the proposed sub-sampling method in MIMO systems and (e) the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) are modelled for wired and wireless communication. The purpose of this SNR/SINR modelling is to determine the contribution of various parameters to the reception error when <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> and wireless channels are considered.|$|R
40|$|Multicrystalline (MC) silicon {{solar cells}} are {{manufactured}} from bread-loaf sized ingots of solar-grade silicon {{by means of}} a multi-wire saw. In a <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> saw system, MC ingots are sliced with an area of 100 x 100 mm 2 and the latest wire saw systems can achieve thicknesses down to 300 microns. What makes this a challenging simulation problem is the wide range of timescales that characterize the overall cutting process. The slowest dynamics are associated with the evolution of the cut, which is described by a spatially dependent differential equation in time and in which the cutting rate is modeled much {{in the same manner as}} the Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) process. The goal is to understand the physical mechanisms that limit how thin the wafers can be cut and to determine the sensitivity of cutting time and cutting rate based on process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} HWCVD, the power {{consumption in the}} iCVD process is dominated by heat conduction rather than radiation. This {{is due to the}} fact that while the <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> temperature for HWCVD is about 1750 – 2200 °C, for iCVD the temperature is only 250 – 500 °C. Typical deposition pressures are in the transition regime between the collision free regime, where the conduction is pressure dependent, and the collision mediated regime, where the conduction is pressure independent. The power loss due to heat conductivities of molecular nitrogen, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and tert-butylperoxide (TBPO) gases have been determined experimentally for these pressure regimes. The necessary power input to the filaments can be explained to be due to mainly heat dissipation by radiation and by gas conduction. This means that the dissociation process requires only very little power, about 2 % of the total power consumption in a typical iCVD process...|$|R

An implementation of these ideas is detailed, and performance analyses are presented. 1 Introduction In today's world, information is a very valuable commodity. For such information to be usable, it is important that it be structured, and easily made available to potential users. In [Chandrasekar and Ramani, 1988 b], we have considered bibliographic information retrieval as a potential domain of application. In this paper, we will consider the categorization, archival and retrieval of news stories from a wire service agency. However, many of the ideas presented here transfer smoothly to other domains. 2 The Need for News Archival and Retrieval A <b>typical</b> <b>wire</b> service agency in India distributes about 600 stories every day to its subscribers.

30|$|In <b>typical</b> <b>wired</b> {{networks}} {{where the}} route for {{the connection is}} relatively invariable, TCP performs well and network congestion is the key factor affecting its performance. However, in multi-hop wireless networks, route failures are the norm {{rather than the exception}} and occur frequently due to mobility and high BER. When a route failure occurs, packets that are buffered at the intermediate nodes along the route will be dropped. Moreover, the routing protocol would take time to discover a route-route re-computation process. The amount of time required for retransmitting the dropped packets and for discovering a new route has a negative impact on TCP performance. In addition, when TCP detects the bursty losses, TCP sender will encounter a time-out or even series of time-outs. In this case, TCP will dramatically reduce the size of cwnd and ssthresh because it does not have the ability to distinguish between losses due to route failure and those due to congestion. Therefore, {{it takes a long time}} for the sending rate to return to a high value after a new route is restored.|$|R
