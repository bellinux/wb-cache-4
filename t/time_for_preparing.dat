By introducing pair lecturing we aimed to use the interaction between the teachers to model the entire process of developing consistent software models as well as to encourage students to take a deep approach to learning. The educational impact of pair lecturing was evaluated using a survey-based instrument. Most students reported that they were more active during the lectures and remembered more compared to a traditional lecture. The increase in lecturing hours was compensated by needing less <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>preparing</b> for our project supervision. And being two teachers in the lecture hall was really fun...|$|E

Time spent on family care and leisure increases time spent for both preparing food at home and for purchasing prepared food, and that varies by gender and by socio-economic characteristics.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the situation of}} conventional oil and gas, this paper examines the global oil and gas discoveries, proved reserves, production, consumption and price. All the influencing factors can be subjected to risk and opportunity analyses, so in the paper, we build upon a risk-opportunity analysis framework, which is a new train of thought. To forecast the peak time {{of oil and gas}} production, we used the methods of multi-Hubbert model forecasting and data forecasting. Our results showed that the world oil production will reach a peak between 2010 and 2015 and the gas production will reach a peak around 2030 Oil peak is coming and gas peak is on the way. The main purpose of forecasting oil and gas production peak is give people enough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>preparing</b> mitigation and adaptation plans. This means taking decisive action well before the problem is obvious.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The primary {{aim of the}} {{following}} study is to study the utility of microwave stimulated rapid processing of tissues for histopathology and the secondary aim is to compare {{the quality of the}} final product obtained after microwave stimulated rapid tissue processing with the conventional method. Materials and Methods: During the 3 years period of study, 150 cases were studied which were randomly selected from the tissues sent for histopathology. Tissues were processed by conventional method and by microwave assisted tissue processing. Results: Slides obtained by microwave and conventional tissue processing were statistically analyzed by using Chi-square test. The results obtained showed that the cellular and nuclear features of microwave processed tissues were comparable to conventionally processed tissue. Microwave assisted tissue processing reduced the total <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>preparing</b> tissue blocks to about an hour. Conclusion: Microwave stimulated processing provides an attractive alternative over traditional conventional processing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Bid {{preparation}} is a non profitable process per se and thus offers a high potential for improvement: The costs and <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>preparing</b> a bid {{have to be}} little and the success rate must be high. This paper presents a case study which demonstrates how a small company {{in the construction industry}} can increase its efficiency in the area of bid preparation by redesigning its processes and introducing new information and communication technology. The paper summarises the current problems in bid preparation and outlines the approach which was taken to improve them. A reference model for an ideal bidding process is presented and a corresponding software system is described which provides specific support for co-operative bidding in the supply chain. The benefits which were achieved in a pilot project at a manufacturer of marble and granite are outlined and the findings from the approach are summarised...|$|E
