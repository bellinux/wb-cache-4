5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry Charles and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of the episodes in Season 2. [...] "The Statue" [...] was the second episode Charles wrote for the show, though {{it was the first}} to be aired. Charles was mostly interested {{in the development of the}} Kramer character, as he felt [...] "Jerry and George were so well-defined through Larry [...] and Jerry, that there was less room for me <b>to,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> expand on those personas. But Kramer was very unformed at the beginning of the show and it gave me an area of creativity <b>to,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> expand upon. So I spent a lot of time with Kramer because he was a character that I could have an impact on in the future of the show". Richards enjoyed how his character evolved and, after the filming of the episode, went to Seinfeld, Charles and David and said [...] "we should keep going that way." [...] He cites this episode, as well as [...] "The Revenge" [...] (in which Kramer puts concrete in a washing machine), as episodes that really defined the character.|$|E
500|$|Hints of {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} appear in several episodes in Season 13. In the episode [...] "Forget Me Not" [...] Sara finally reveals {{that she and}} Grissom had split up. In {{the end of the}} episode, she admitted to Nick and Greg that at {{the night of the murder}} she was expecting to see Grissom; Nick even admits that he and everyone else that worked with Grissom liked having them both together <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hang on to but realized that if the relationship is over, it's over.|$|E

500|$|The film {{ends with}} a post-credits scene {{featuring}} Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who approaches Stark regarding the [...] "Avenger Initiative". Favreau said that he included the scene as [...] "a little tip of the hat for the fans...a way <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> tee up The Avengers." [...] Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeletal crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking. Captain America's shield is also visible {{in the background of}} a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.|$|E

[...] He then explained that the new album would be [...] "more concise and would be a bit more original, I want to say, and sort of pop out like Is a Real Boy did." [...] He also explained that this CD has both the catchiest and most mature songs they've ever recorded and called it a [...] "step forward." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{brought the}} character {{back to the}} show {{in the second half}} of the final season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, [...] "Finally, all of your questions [...] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, [...] "No, they will not". Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet and honest. And I think, hopefully, when people see our scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too. [...] are so incredibly real with each other. I was really grateful that I got to play those scenes and Libby got <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> express herself in ways that she hasn’t been able to." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} part of qualifying, Massa set the fastest time, taking pole {{position}} from second placed Alonso {{in the last}} few seconds as rain began to fall, with Räikkönen completing the top three. Massa's lap of 1:35.043 marked tyre company Bridgestone's 100th pole position in Formula One. Hamilton came fourth, over half a second behind the leading three. He conceded inexperience was to blame, saying that there were [...] "some spots of rain on my visor, so I had <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> let off". Heidfeld qualified fifth, ahead of Nico Rosberg in sixth and teammate Kubica in seventh. The Toyotas of Trulli and Schumacher were eighth and ninth, with Webber completing the top ten.|$|E
500|$|UPN {{requested}} a modified ending to the episode, {{as the original}} version had Phlox and Archer disagreeing {{over what to do}} with the Valakians. Archer would have wanted to save the race, while Phlox would have wanted evolution to take its course. John Billingsley, who played Doctor Phlox in Enterprise, didn't agree with the changed version, saying [...] "the ending that had initially been created I was fairly comfortable with. But the head of the studio suggested some revisions on the ending. What do you do? I wasn't as happy with the revisions, but it's not my show, you have <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> adjust, even if sometimes it does seem a bit of a contradiction in terms for what your character is supposed to be about." ...|$|E
500|$|Ward {{was very}} happy with the episode. [...] He complimented {{storyboard}} artists Muto and Sugar, saying that the former [...] "has a hilarious slapstick set-up-the-punchline kind of style of comedy" [...] and the latter [...] "is amazing at executing these super romantic, emotional goosebump-kind of feelings". He was particularly pleased with the ending, noting that [...] "I love that goose-bumps feeling in a climactic scene with music rising. In that episode you're talking about, there is that rising action toward the end, and then LSP [...] cuts in and says 'drama bomb!' {{in the middle of it}} <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> like, cut its legs out. Which I think is a lot of fun." [...] The episode was later nominated for a 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program, although it did not win.|$|E

500|$|The Make-Up's gospel {{attitude}} {{was related to}} utilization of the audience as a group member, which Svenonius likened {{to the rise of}} the 90s dance music scene: [...] "We're not interested in countering it. It makes sense to me that techno, rave and dance music should go over in the face of rock and roll because it's democratic for everybody to express themselves. [...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy. [...] We want to be at once entertaining and inclusive in terms of using the gospel form <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> breathe life into the old Frankenstein monster". [...] Svenonius would often interact with the audience in a number of ways, including call and response lyrics, direct address, and leaving the stage and going out into the crowd.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 on British television, Mona Best, {{with her}} son present, said of his dismissal: [...] "From the point of clash of personalities, well, {{probably}} that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others. [...] I'll leave that for other people to say but {{from my point of}} view we haven't come here <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> throw sticks and stones at the boys because there is no really hard feeling. There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark." [...] Hunter Davies, in his authorised Beatles biography published in 1968, agreed: [...] "There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best is one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> do it all, and it came out in ways better than I imagined it would".|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E
500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously you know in the end result there was no sound and I thought that was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E

Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true {{to the spirit of}} the book, rather than to the letter". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to get everything [...] could in there. And where [...] couldn't, <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen".|$|E

500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

Goddard describes Cane as a [...] "typical Australian, working-class {{kind of guy}} who mined opals, raised goats, then went off for travel and adventure <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> find himself". Global BC penned Cane as [...] "mysterious". SoapNet described Cane as a [...] "pretty stand-up guy", as well as [...] "loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about". The network said his time in Genoa City has [...] "made him a good man". In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Goddard said that Cane working at Jabot Cosmetics is [...] "very enthusiastic and cautious about falling into a family business which is an Abbott company", and that he is [...] "very sensitive about that". He also stated that Cane [...] "has no fears in doing business with anybody" [...] because if you can come from a [...] "family of gangsters than business people don’t really measure up". Looking back on Cane's [...] "power jobs", Goddard stated: [...] "I don’t think Cane has the book learning skills side of it, but I think he has the life lessons side of it, based on who he is and where he has come from. The way he does business with people, he kind of understands who they are as people." ...|$|E

During their teenage years, U2 snuck into a Ramones concert, {{and the experience of}} watching Joey perform made Bono feel less self-conscious about his own singing. [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] is about the difficulty of [...] "giv yourself completely to another person", with lyrical characters who are [...] "addicted <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> failure and rebirth". [...] "California (There Is No End to Love)" [...] recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. [...] "Song for Someone" [...] is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met when they were teenagers. [...] "Iris (Hold Me Close)" [...] is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that [...] "we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments.
