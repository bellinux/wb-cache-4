5|$|The {{head of the}} Rebecca Clarke Society, Liane Curtis, is {{the editor}} of A Rebecca Clarke Reader, {{originally}} published by Indiana University Press in 2004.

5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of <b>the</b> <b>quotation.</b> As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in <b>the</b> <b>quotation,</b> and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>quotation</b> {{price of}} Olympus shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on 15 November had fallen by some 75percent since the scandal erupted. The price {{continued}} to be volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit for price falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price rose by the upper limit of ¥100. Trading only took place after hours as there was a glut of unsatisfied buy orders. The share price rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834yen at one point on 16 November.|$|E

25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>quotation</b> is {{organically}} interwoven into one’s own text, the quoted part {{is marked}} with quotation marks, and common words beginning <b>the</b> <b>quotation</b> {{are written in}} lowercase (even despite the original). For example: A tanterv szerint az iskola egyik célja, hogy „testileg, szellemileg egészséges nemzedéket neveljen”. ‘According to the syllabus, {{one of the goals}} of a school is “to bring up a generation healthy in body and mind.”’ When quoting others’ words in terms of their content, <b>the</b> <b>quotation</b> marks are not used: Alkotmányunk kimondja, hogy társadalmi rendszerünknek a munka az alapja. ‘Our constitution states that our social system is based on work.’ Indirect (reported) speech is treated in the same way.|$|E

25|$|The {{convention}} used to be, and in American English still is, to put full stops (periods) and commas inside <b>the</b> <b>quotation</b> marks, {{irrespective of}} the sense. British English has moved away from this style while American English has kept it. British style now prefers to punctuate according to the sense, in which punctuation marks only appear inside quotation marks if they were there in the original. Formal British English practice requires a full stop to be put inside <b>the</b> <b>quotation</b> marks if the quoted item is a full sentence that ends where the main sentence ends, but {{it is common to}} see the stop outside the ending quotation marks.|$|E
