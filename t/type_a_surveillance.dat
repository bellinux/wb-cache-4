Currently, many <b>ă</b> <b>surveillance</b> strategies and systems are in use around the world. An ă inventory of the data, surveillance strategies, and <b>surveillance</b> systems <b>ă</b> developed worldwide for the surveillance of infectious diseases is ă presented herein, with emphasis {{on the role of}} the microbiology <b>ă</b> laboratory in <b>surveillance.</b> <b>ă</b> Methods: The data, strategies, and systems used around the world for the <b>ă</b> <b>surveillance</b> of infectious diseases and pathogens, along with current ă issues and trends, were reviewed. ă Results: Twelve major classes of data were identified on the basis of ă their timing relative to infection, resources available, and <b>type</b> of <b>ă</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Two primary strategies were compared: disease-specific <b>ă</b> <b>surveillance</b> and syndromic surveillance. Finally, 262 systems ă implemented worldwide for the surveillance of infections were registered ă and briefly described, with a focus on those based on microbiological ă data from laboratories. ă Conclusions: There is currently a wealth of available data on ă infections, which has been growing with the recent emergence of new ă technologies. Concurrently with the expansion of computer resources and ă networks, these data will allow the optimization of real-time detection ă and notification of infections. (C) 2016 The Authors.

40|$|Influenza {{surveillance}} {{was established}} in 1947. From this moment WHO (World Health Organization) has been coordinating international cooperation, with a goal of monitoring influenza virus activity, effective diagnostic of the circulating viruses and informing society about epidemics or pandemics, as well as about emergence of new subtypes of influenza virus <b>type</b> <b>A.</b> Influenza <b>surveillance</b> is <b>an</b> important task, because it enables people to prepare themselves for battle with the virus that is constantly mutating, what leads to circulation of new and often more virulent strains of influenza in human population. As vaccination {{is the most effective}} method of fighting the virus, one of the major tasks of GISRS is developing an optimal antigenic composition of the vaccine for the current epidemic season. European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN) has also developed over the years. EISN is running integrated epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance, to provide appropriate data to public health experts in member countries, to enable them undertaking relevant activities based on the current information about influenza activity. In close cooperation with GISRS and EISN are National Influenza Centres - national institutions designated by the Ministry of Health in each country...|$|R
50|$|Guidance is by {{proportional}} navigation and a semi-active radar homing system using the nose intake cone and four aerials around the intake as an interferometer aerial, with targets being identified by <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> 1022 <b>surveillance</b> radar (originally radar Type 965) and illuminated {{by one of}} a pair of radar Type 909. This allows two targets to be engaged simultaneously in initial versions, with later variants (see below) able to engage more. Firing is from a twin-arm trainable launcher that is loaded automatically from below decks. The original launcher seen on the Bristol was significantly larger than that which appeared on the Type 42 and Invincible classes. Initial difficulties with launcher reliability have been resolved.|$|R
30|$|In this study, the 2014 – 2015 {{eruption}} of Aso volcano was monitored by a seismo-acoustic network composed of six seismic and four infrasound stations (Fig.  1 c; refer to Additional file 1). Half of the seismic stations, i.e., KAF, KAK, and SUN, were equipped with short-period seismometers (flat response for >[*] 1.5  Hz). The others, i.e., UMA, HND, and KSM, were equipped with broadband seismometers (30  s– 50  Hz). Low-frequency microphones were {{used at the}} infrasound stations (ACM, KWM, UMA, and HND; 0.1 – 1000  Hz). Seismic and infrasound signals are recorded at a sampling rate of 100  Hz at all stations. Among these stations, we focus mainly on the data from three stations, KAF, ACM, and UMA (Fig.  1 c), which are the stations closest to the crater among {{each of the three}} <b>types</b> of sensors. <b>A</b> <b>surveillance</b> camera (sampling every 20  s) was also installed on the crater rim of the west side (CAM) to monitor the eruption activity. A weather station (WEA) operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency recorded the air temperature.|$|R

40|$|SoftShare is {{a trench}} coat that {{features}} embedded e-textile and wearable technology. The coat has a soft circuit and sensors {{built into the}} design facilitating an interaction that explores interrelationships between surveillance and embodied experience. Following a set of simple instructions, the person wearing this garment is capable of creating a short sensorial travel diary. The coat is <b>an</b> expressive <b>surveillance</b> tool that allows the user to play with interpreting and experiencing {{the place where they}} are. When the user manipulates two of the sensors, the data from other sensors and a GPS are recorded to the memory of the micro-controller. The information that is gathered from the user’s body by different sensors is combined with the responses that are contributed by the user to certain elements in the place that she is in. The user may only control a portion of the information that is recorded. The wearable is a trench coat because this is the costume of a private investigator and the user playing the game is participating in <b>a</b> <b>type</b> of <b>surveillance.</b> The interactive components {{in the design of the}} coat enable the user to react to the presence of surveillance with tactile and embodied responses.

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about the {{possibility}} that the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent could have been transmitted to sheep populations via contaminated feedstuffs. The objective of our study was to investigate the suitability of molecular strain <b>typing</b> methods as <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> tool for studying scrapie strain variations and for differentiating PrP(Sc) from sheep scrapie, BSE, and sheep BSE. We studied 38 Italian sheep scrapie cases from 13 outbreaks, along with a British scrapie case, an experimental ovine BSE, and 3 BSE cases, by analyzing the glycoform patterns and the apparent molecular masses of the nonglycosylated forms of semipurified, proteinase-treated PrP(Sc). Both criteria were able to clearly differentiate sheep scrapie from BSE and ovine experimental BSE. PrP(Sc) from BSE and sheep BSE showed a higher glycoform ratio and a lower molecular mass of the nonglycosylated form compared to scrapie PrP(Sc). Scrapie cases displayed homogeneous PrP(Sc) features regardless of breed, flock, and geographic origin. The glycoform patterns observed varied with the antibody used, but either a monoclonal antibody (MAb) (F 99 / 97. 6. 1) or a polyclonal antibody (P 7 - 7) was able to distinguish scrapie from BSE PrP(Sc). While more extensive surveys are needed to further corroborate these findings, our results suggest that large-scale molecular screening of sheep populations for BSE surveillance may be eventually possible.

40|$|Background and aim. Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a frequent}} cancer. Its prognosis is highly dependent on early diagnosis. Patients at risk for developing HCC should be enrolled in <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> programme. Nevertheless, many patients at risk are not regularly screened. We aimed at exploring the characteristics that affect enrolment in <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> programme. Material and methods. The characteristics of the patients included in the prospective Bern HCC cohort between August 2010 and August 2011 were analysed according to their participation in <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> programme. Results. Among the 82 patients included in the cohort {{during this period of}} time, 48 were in <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> program before the diagnosis of HCC. Thirty five percent of cirrhotic patients were not screened. Age, sex, level of education, Child-Pugh status and MELD score were similar between the patients who were screened and those who were not screened. Patients with a private insurance and patients treated by a liver specialist were more frequently enrolled in <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> program. Sixty seven percent of the screened patients were eligible for curative treatment whereas only 15 % of the non-screened patients were. Conclusions. In conclusion the surveillance of patients at risk for developing HCC increases their chances to be diagnosed at an early stage to allow curative treatment. More than one third of cirrhotic patients were not regularly screened. Patients with chronic liver disease should be referred to identify those at risk and enrol them in <b>a</b> <b>surveillance</b> program...|$|R
