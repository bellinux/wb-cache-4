This thesis {{is the study}} of the cost associated with expanding <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug abuse education program as a means of controlling <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug abuse problem. It focuses on <b>the</b> former <b>Navy</b> Drug and Alcohol Safety Action Program (NADSAP) now the Personal Responsibility and Values Education and Training (PREVENT) course. The thesis asks the questions: What are the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug population? What are the costs/benefits of <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> Level III rehabilitation program? What are the costs of separating sailors who use illegal drugs? What are the costs/benefits of <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug education program? In conclusion, the thesis proposes that <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug education program is the most cost-effective alternative and should be expanded. It also suggest that the appropriate mix of education, rehabilitation, and separation would balance the marginal benefits per dollar for each alternative. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

5|$|After the war, Radford was a {{principal}} opponent {{to a plan}} to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split the Army and the Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and <b>the</b> <b>Navy</b> under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing {{the loss of their}} branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for <b>the</b> <b>Navy</b> because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with limited power and with <b>the</b> <b>Navy</b> maintaining control of its air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Navy</b> was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced <b>the</b> <b>Navy</b> to reopen the investigation.
