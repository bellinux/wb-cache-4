5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{the then}} Director of Operations Group Captain Robert Saundby, {{complained that the}} role for Coastal Command in war, namely {{supporting}} the bomber offensive, and second, the support of naval forces along the British coastline, were too limited and {{was in danger of}} diverting the Command from its main concern: ASW. In October the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS) Air Vice Marshal Richard Peirse confirmed that there was no formal role for the service or location of its units. Peirse did reverse the decision to have strategic bombing support as the primary function. This was changed to trade defence. Coastal Command was only to be used for other purposes if trade routes were suffering little interference and the intensity of air attack on Britain, or air attacks on enemy targets, required all available air units for those purposes. However, in December 1937, the Naval and Air Staffs met again and changed the priority to North Sea reconnaissance. The Naval Staff insisted that surface commerce raiders presented <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger,</b> and aircraft could prove decisive only in locating enemy warships. ASW remained in third place, after direct co-operation with surface fleets. In December 1938, this was changed again, and ASW moved up to second priority. In August 1939 it was moved to first priority. When Coastal Command went to war, its first task was to co-operate with the Navy to prevent enemy vessels from escaping into the North Sea and Atlantic Oceans. Secondly, it was to provide ASW support where and when it could. These steps are significant as the language indicates a change from passive reconnaissance of enemy warships and submarines to an active directive which involved the attack of the vessels by Coastal Command aircraft.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 {{report for}} DEFRA, {{conducted}} following the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, found that, discounting 'exotic {{events such as}} meteorite impacts', 'in most plausible circumstances {{it is likely that}} such an event would be contained by current defences, designed to resist storm surges, for all major developed areas', however the joint occurrence of events, such as a tsunami coinciding with a storm surge, was discounted. The report did, however call for additional more detailed modelling to be carried out, recommended that the Met Office should provide a tsunami warning service, and that detection devices should be upgraded. A follow-up report indicated that, of the three likely scenarios modelled, a Lisbon-type event would pose <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger,</b> potentially resulting in a tsunami wave exceeding the 1:100 year extreme sea level at the Cornish peninsula by up to 1.4m, but being within the range elsewhere. This conclusion is markedly different from the greater heights calculated by Bryant and Haslett as having been encountered in the Bristol Channel during the 1607 Bristol Channel floods.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of the offensive, British troops {{continued}} to fall back, losing their last footholds on the original front line. Thick fog impeded operations and did not disperse until early afternoon. Isolated engagements took place as the Germans pressed forward and the British held their posts, often not knowing who was to either side of them. Brigade and battalion control over events was absent. It was a day of stubborn and often heroic actions by platoons, sections and even individuals isolated from their comrades by the fragmented nature of the battle and lack of visibility. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> facing the British on 22 March was that the Third and Fifth armies might become separated. Byng did not order a retirement from the Flesquières salient, which his army had won at such cost and Haig ordered him to keep in contact with the Fifth Army, even if that required a further retreat; the day also saw the first French troops enter the battle on the southern flank.|$|E

500|$|During the Peninsular War, the 52nd {{fulfilled}} their {{dual role}} as line and light infantry by contributing to fortress assault parties. The companies {{that led the}} breach assaults were known as the [...] "Forlorn Hope", (from the Dutch [...] "verloren hoop" [...] (lost troop)). It was deemed an act of high honour, since the lead troops faced <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger.</b> The 52nd contributed to the Forlorn Hope at the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz (1812) and San Sebastian. Officers and sergeants who survived would be very likely be put up for battlefield promotions (although it was not assured) while other ranks would receive laurels from their commander also with the chance of promotion being greatly increased. The 52nd, however, offered its own recognition: those who survived the Forlorn Hope at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz were entitled to wear on their right arm a badge displaying a laurel wreath and the letters [...] "V.S." [...] for [...] "Valiant Stormer". This honour was awarded by the 52nd's commanding officer, and was restricted to the 52nd.|$|E
500|$|Being {{aware that}} an over-rash pursuit was <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> when {{fighting}} armies {{trained in the}} fluid tactics of the Turks, Richard halted the charge after about [...] had been covered. The right flank Crusader units, which had formed the van of the column, including the English and Normans {{had not yet been}} heavily engaged in close combat, and they formed a reserve on which the rest regrouped. Freed from the pressure of being actively pursued, many of the Ayyubid troops turned to cut down those of the knights who had unwisely drawn ahead of the rest. James d'Avesnes, the commander of one of the Franco-Flemish units, was the most prominent of those killed in this episode. [...] Amongst the Ayyubid leaders who rallied quickly and returned to the fight was Taqi al-Din, Saladin's nephew. He led 700 men of the Sultan's own bodyguard against Richard's left flank. Once their squadrons were back in order, Richard led his knights in a second charge and the forces of Saladin broke once again.|$|E

500|$|Reaching the German—Danish border at 55°N 05°E, {{they turned}} south. The {{formation}} headed towards Schleswig-Holstein and then planned to turn due west to Wilhelmshaven. The move {{was designed to}} initiate the attack from the east, through the [...] "back door". The plan worked, as the bombers arrived without being intercepted, but the southward journey had given the Germans a one-hour warning, as the Freya radar {{had picked up the}} bombers [...] off the coast. As the bombers passed down the coast, anti-aircraft artillery fire from ships and harbour defences was noted. Once in the target area they also came under heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire from Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven. Ships near Schillig Roads also opened fire. The bombers replied with their machine guns to throw the gunners off. German fire was at the correct height but exploded behind the bombers. Soon after, the formation was over Wilhelmshaven harbour, with Gneisenau and Scharnhorst at anchor beneath them. However, the ships were too close to shore and Kellett chose not to risk dropping bombs to avoid civilian casualties. Kellett—commanding the formation—had been ordered to attack at minimum altitude (about [...] ). The belief that <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> would come from anti-aircraft fire, not German fighters, had by then become part of RAF operational doctrine.|$|E
500|$|As soon as Tzazon {{received}} his brother's message, he left Sardinia {{and landed in}} Africa, joining up with Gelimer at Bulla. The Vandal king now determined to advance on Carthage. His intentions are not clear; the traditional interpretation is that he hoped to reduce the city by blockading it, but Ian Hughes believes that, lacking the reserves for a protracted war of attrition, he hoped to force Belisarius into a [...] "single, decisive confrontation". Approaching the city, the Vandal army cut the aqueduct supplying it with water, and attempted to prevent provisions from arriving in the city. Gelimer also dispatched agents {{to the city to}} undermine the loyalty of the inhabitants and the imperial army. Belisarius, who was alert to the possibility of treachery, set an example by impaling a citizen of Carthage who intended to join the Vandals. <b>The</b> <b>greatest</b> <b>danger</b> for defection came from the Huns, who were disgruntled because they had been ferried to Africa against their will and feared being left there as a garrison. Indeed, Vandal agents had already made contact with them, but Belisarius managed to maintain their allegiance—at least for the moment—by making a solemn promise that after the final victory they would be richly rewarded and allowed to return to their homes. Their loyalty however remained suspect, and, like the Moors, the Huns probably awaited to see who would emerge as the victor and rally to him.|$|E
