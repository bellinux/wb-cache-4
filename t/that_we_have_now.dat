25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 October 2006, it was {{confirmed}} that the second series of Life on Mars would be the last. Matthew Graham stated: [...] "We decided that Sam's journey should have a finite life span and a clear-cut ending and we feel <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> reached that point after two series". Graham's claim that two endings had been filmed was later revealed to be a ruse.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently however, {{a public}} {{statement}} signed by {{six of the}} 10 LSE student participants on the trip said that [...] "We feel <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> been put in more risk than was originally the case, {{as a result of}} the LSE's decision to go public with their story". They also indicated that they had no objection to the broadcast of the BBC Panorama documentary and that they were satisfied with how the BBC handled the trip.|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} {{remarkable}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> travelled 1000 miles without meeting with any {{people in the}} heart of the whole continent of Africa, where, to be sure, never man set his foot since the sons of Noah spread themselves over the face of the whole earth. Here also our gunner took an observation with his forestaff, to determine our latitude, and he found <b>now,</b> that <b>having</b> marched about thirty-three days northward, we were in 6 degrees 22 minutes south latitude.|$|R
60|$|To this Percy {{strongly}} objected. He {{was going}} out on a sort of a bear-hunt, and to him half the pleasure would be lost if he did not carry a gun. I am not a coward, but a boy with a gun is a terror to me. My expression may have intimated my state of mind, for Mr. Larramie said to me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> gone so far {{that it would be a}} pity to send Percy back, and that he did not think there would be any danger, for his boy had been taught how to carry a gun properly.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 June 2010, Poland's Interior Ministry {{published}} a transcript {{from the cockpit}} voice recorder of the crashed Tu-154M. The transcript confirmed earlier reports that the aircraft had attempted to land in bad weather {{against the advice of}} air traffic control and the plane's terrain awareness warning system. At one point in the recording, Mariusz Kazana, the Director of Diplomatic Protocol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, enters the cockpit and was told by the pilot [...] "Sir, the fog is increasing. At the moment, under these conditions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now,</b> we will not manage to land" [...] to which Kazana replies [...] "Well, then we have a problem." ...|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile {{the room}} was filling up, for {{it was the day}} {{appointed}} to discuss the results of our observations. Everyone, I thought, felt as I did about Castalia. They kissed her and said how glad they were to see her again. At length, when we were all assembled, Jane rose and said {{that it was time to}} begin. She began by saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> asked questions for over five years, and that though the results were bound to be inconclusive--here Castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not so sure about that. Then she got up, and, interrupting Jane in the middle of a sentence, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{making some}} further {{preparations}} and fidgeting about a little, Bickley announced <b>that</b> as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> some proper paraffin lamps {{of the powerful}} sort which are known as [...] "hurricane," [...] he proposed by their aid to carry out further examinations in the cave.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I said; [...] "but I {{have some}} office {{business}} {{that will take}} me to Gormanville to-morrow, and I did not know but {{you might like to}} go too, and look the ground over, and see how much <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been suffering for them unnecessarily." [...] The fact was <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> scarcely spoken of Glendenning or the Bentleys for six months, and our minds were far too full of our own affairs to be given more than very superficially to theirs at any time. [...] "We could both go as well as not," [...] I suggested, [...] "and you could call upon the Bentleys while I looked after the company's business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should say}} so," [...] Turnbull laughed. [...] "However, {{as it has}} turned out well, and you have {{fulfilled}} your mission, it doesn't matter to us; and I hope <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> done with this creeping alongshore work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} it was {{undoubtedly}} so. I rather think, Inspector Martin, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will kindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. MacIan," [...] he said, [...] "I {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> definitely settled that in {{the conventional}} language honour is not satisfied. Our action must at least go further than it has gone under recent interrupted conditions. That, I believe, is understood." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lumley obeyed, but {{the letter}} {{contained}} {{little more of}} interest. We cared not for <b>that,</b> however. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> a subject capable of keeping us in speculative talk for a week--the mere {{fact that there was}} actually a civilised woman--a lady perhaps--at all events a Macnab--within two hundred miles of us! ...|$|R

There are others who will remember that Ireland has extended her boundaries, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> to reckon with her not merely in the Old World but in the New.|$|E

"But be they {{friends or}} be they enemies, sir," [...] {{continued}} Dillon, respectfully, [...] "there is much {{reason to think}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> in the abbey those who can tell us something of their true character; for the men we have detained carry with them the appearance of having just landed, and wear not only the dress but the air of seamen." ...|$|E

"Your nerves are not {{so strong}} as mine," [...] I said, by way of apology for my {{apparent}} dictation, [...] "and for that reason I must beg leave to assume the leadership in all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> to do, until I see the leaden coffin soldered down and safe in your possession. After that I shall resign all my functions to you." ...|$|E

60|$|To {{be quite}} clear in what I wish to say {{of the present}} {{relation}} of Boston to our other literary centres, I must repeat <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> no such literary centre as Boston was. Boston itself has perhaps outgrown the literary consciousness which formerly distinguished it from all our other large towns. In a place of nearly a million people (I count in the outlying places) newspapers must be more than books; and that alone says everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} warmly for your kindness, my lord, {{but it is}} not with that view <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> come to you, though I am sure that we both should prefer to fight under our own flag, rather than under that of a foreign king, however kindly he may be {{disposed}} to us, personally.

5000|$|Many {{negative}} {{responses were}} received from schools {{that did not}} admit women into their engineering programs. From the University of North Carolina, Thorndike Saville, associate Professor of Sanitary Engineering wrote: [...] "I would state <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>now,</b> <b>have</b> never had, and {{do not expect to}} have in the near future, any women students registered in our engineering department." ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{one good}} Scotch word, [...] "birstle," [...] {{was indeed the}} most of the story of the day <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>now</b> to pass. You are to {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> lay on the bare top of a rock, like scones upon a girdle; the sun beat upon us cruelly; the rock grew so heated, a man could scarce endure the touch of it; and the little patch of earth and fern, which kept cooler, was only large enough for one at a time. We took turn about to lie on the naked rock, which was indeed like the position of that saint that was martyred on a gridiron; and it ran in my mind how strange it was, that in the same climate and at only a few days' distance, I should have suffered so cruelly, first from cold upon my island and now from heat upon this rock.|$|R

I am sorry to say that I find a further discrepancy of seventy pounds. I am able, however, to assure you <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> touched bottom. The total amount is three hundred and forty pounds, and a cheque for that sum at your early convenience would oblige us, as we are anxious to bring so unpleasant a business to a conclusion.--Yours truly, ...|$|E
