At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Tungsten, four batteries of heavy anti-aircraft guns and seven batteries of light guns were located on the shore near the battleship. Several anti-aircraft vessels and destroyers were also usually moored near Tirpitz. The battleship herself was fitted with 68 anti-aircraft guns. Equipment capable of generating an artificial smokescreen to hide Tirpitz from aircraft had also been installed around Kaafjord. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) had {{only a small number}} of fighters stationed at bases near Kaafjord, and their operations were constrained by a lack of fuel. British intelligence believed that the German fighter force in the area could be rapidly expanded in the event of an emergency. The Luftwaffe typically conducted three reconnaissance flights into the Arctic Sea each day.|$|E

25|$|The {{octane rating}} became {{important}} as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s. A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost, and thus higher temperatures and pressures, which translate to higher power output. Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power. In 1943, the Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984kW) using 100 RON fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement. By the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Overlord during World War II both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using 150 RON fuel (100/150 avgas), obtained by adding 2.5% aniline to 100 octane avgas. By this time the Rolls-Royce Merlin 66 was developing 2,000hp using this fuel.|$|E

If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process.

The improved defences in place by the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Mascot included a cliff-top observation post near Kaafjord, which was capable of directing the battleship's anti-aircraft guns if necessary.

500|$|The Truk {{garrison}} received few {{shipments of}} reinforcements or supplies following {{the capture of}} the Palau islands by US forces in September 1944, and historian David Hobbs has stated {{that it had been}} [...] "reduced to starving impotence" [...] by the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Inmate. The garrison's main activity from mid-1944 onwards was growing food to sustain itself. The tropical conditions and damage caused by air attacks complicated this effort, and most of the Japanese personnel were malnourished. Nevertheless, the garrison also took extensive measures to protect the atoll from invasion and placed large stores of food and other supplies in reserve for such an eventuality. Following {{the end of the war}} in August 1945, United States forces found that the garrison still held enough ammunition to supply its gun batteries for at least 30 days of combat.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{military}} analyst William Connor cautioned {{that in the}} Soviet sense, the doctrine covered much more than camouflage and deception. It had, he suggested, the connotation of active control of the enemy. By the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Bagration in 1944, Connor argues, the Russian doctrine of military deception already included all these aspects. The meaning evolved in Soviet practice and doctrine to include strategic, political, and diplomatic objectives, in other words operating at all levels. This differs from Western doctrines on deception, and from information warfare doctrines, by its emphasis on pragmatic aspects. According to the analyst James Hansen, deception [...] "is treated as an operational art to be polished by professors of military science and officers who specialize in this area." [...] In 2015, Julian Lindley-French described strategic maskirovka as [...] "a new level of ambition" [...] established by Moscow to unbalance the West both politically and militarily.|$|E

500|$|Drvar {{was located}} within the {{territory}} of the German puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (which included Bosnia and Herzegovina). Tito's personal headquarters was initially located in a cave about [...] north of the centre of Drvar. The Unac River ran along the base of the ridge line above the cave, creating an obstacle to movement between the town and the cave, and a rail line ran along the ridge line behind the cave. In addition to Partisan headquarters, various Partisan and Communist Party of Yugoslavia support, training and youth organisations were also based in and around Drvar at the time, along with the Tito Escort Battalion which was responsible for his personal safety. The British and Soviet military missions to the Partisans were also stationed in villages close to Drvar, as were some United States military officers on various missions. The British mission was headed by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean, who was in London {{at the time of the}} raid, and included Major Randolph Churchill, son of Winston Churchill.
