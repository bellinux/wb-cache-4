5|$|Constant news of Ottoman {{campaigns against}} Bosnia and Morea but not against Albania seemed <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been {{considering}} an armistice with Skanderbeg. The latter {{took advantage of}} this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible attack by Skanderbeg's elusive ally in northern Albania, Lekë Dukagjini, who {{had been trying to}} expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks. In order to curb his ambitions, Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice. Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini, while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance. The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini, giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg, or be subject to interdiction; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option. He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses.|$|E
5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{continued}} during autumn 1938. The Soviets {{reduced their}} demands: a Red Army operation {{was not an}} option anymore and the focus was shifted on securing the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets wanted to be informed of key elements of the Finnish–Estonian Gulf blockade, the secret military plan against the Baltic Fleet. Furthermore, Yartsev suggested that the Finns fortify the Suursaari island, but that the Soviets would take care of its defence. During the negotiations, Rudolf Holsti resigned as foreign minister, although not for reasons associated with the negotiations, and his place was taken by Eljas Erkko. Holsti was rather anti-German, so the resignation set off rumours, quickly quelled by the Finnish government, that he had been forced to resign by a Finnish government sympathetic to the Germans. The Finns attempted to appear even-handed, and the interior ministry issued an order banning the extreme-right IKL. The ban was reversed by the Finnish courts as being unconstitutional. Many years later, the minister in charge at that time, Urho Kekkonen, admitted that this was a simple gesture, <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> Moscow that Finland did not harbour a German fifth column.|$|E

5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E

Moral pressures forced some town councils to establish zones for the women and men to bathe separately.

Its farming equivalent, the Saskatchewan Grain Growers Association, was the dominant political force in the province until the 1920s; it had close ties with the governing Liberal party.|$|E

25|$|Conservative MP Colonel Howard Vincent {{questioned}} Gladstone in the Commons on {{what his}} government would do about unemployment on 1 September 1893. Gladstone replied: I cannot help regretting that the honourable and gallant Gentleman has felt it {{his duty to}} put the question. It is put under circumstances that naturally belong {{to one of those}} fluctuations in the condition of trade which, however unfortunate and lamentable they may be, recur from time to time. Undoubtedly I think that questions of this kind, whatever be the intention of the questioner, have a tendency to produce in the minds of people, or <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> the people, that these fluctuations can be corrected by the action of the Executive Government.

25|$|The {{international}} trade of whale meat is prohibited by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). However, Japan, Norway and Iceland registered reservations with the treaty {{in order to}} remain exempt. The Norwegian company, Myklebust Trading, exports common minke whale and Iceland's Hvalur hf exports Fin whale, which is an endangered species. Environmental organizations criticized the trade and expressed doubts that Japanese markets could absorb the increase in supply as thousands of tonnes of whale meat remained in cold storage in Japan. In 2010, Iceland's proposed quota in killing fin whales was much larger than the amount of whale meat the Japanese market could absorb. In negotiations with Marc Wall, Economic Minister-Counselor at the US embassy in Tokyo, Jun Yamashita of the Japanese Fisheries Agencies, however, rejected a 2010 proposal <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> Iceland {{to reduce the number of}} killed fin whales to a more reasonable number.|$|E
500|$|Julia Maesa {{had retired}} {{to her home}} town of Emesa with an immense fortune, which she had accrued {{over the course of}} twenty years. She took her children, Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, and grandchildren, {{including}} Elagabalus, with her to Emesa. Elagabalus, aged 14, was the chief priest of the Phoenician sun-deity Elagabalus (or El-Gabal) in Emesa. Soldiers from Legio III Gallica [...] (Gallic Third Legion), that had been stationed at the nearby camp of Raphanea, often visited Emesa and went to see Elagabalus perform his priestly rituals and duties while there. Julia Maesa took advantage of this, <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> the soldiers that Elagabalus was indeed the illegitimate son of Caracalla. On May 16, Elagabalus was proclaimed emperor by the Legio III Gallica at its camp at Raphanea. Upon Elagabalus' revolt, Macrinus travelled to Apamea and conferred the title of Augustus onto Diadumenianus and made him co-emperor.|$|E

In a letter printed in the New York Tribune, Gilder expressed disappointment that the Mint was planning to generate the new designs in-house, feeling that the Mint, essentially a factory for coins, was ill-equipped to generate artistic coin designs. Due to Gilder's prominence in the coinage redesign movement, Leech {{felt the need to}} respond personally, which he did in early August. He told Gilder that [...] "artistic designs for coins, that would meet the ideas of an art critic like yourself, and artists generally, are not always adapted for practical coining". He assured Gilder that the designs which Barber had already prepared had met with the approval of Mitchell, though Leech himself had some improvements <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> the chief engraver.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Whitney was {{guaranteed}} {{to appear in}} seven of the first 13 episodes, and contracted for four days work on each. However, she was used for nine additional days, leading D'Agosta <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> Roddenberry that if guest stars instead played the similar role but with different characters then they [...] "would cost less and hold as much value". He added that they should instead look to using Whitney on a free-lance basis instead of under permanent contract. By September 8, 1966, Whitney's agent had been informed that her contract had been terminated, which was around a week prior to the shoot of her final episode, [...] "The Conscience of the King". Roddenberry told Whitney that he didn't want to lose Rand as he wanted her relationship with Kirk to continue. In a memo to Gene Coon on October 27, 1966, Roddenberry suggested bringing Whitney back as Rand, albeit with a different hairstyle {{similar to the way}} she wore it in Police Story as this [...] "made her look much younger and softer", but she was never invited back to the series.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, every English county cricket {{team had}} an amateur captain. Yorkshire had been led by amateurs since Lord Hawke {{took over the}} {{position}} in 1883. Amateurs were usually from privileged backgrounds, while professionals were mainly from the working classes. Class distinctions pervaded the game, which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs. They wished to preserve leadership roles {{for members of the}} Establishment, in defiance of broader social changes that had reduced their influence in other sports. Administrators argued that amateurs were better captains as they were free from worries over [...] employment. The Wisden editor believed that [...] "the professional may have difficulty in enforcing discipline. He would naturally hesitate <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> his committee that this player or that should be dropped, and so be instrumental in depriving the man in question of some part of his livelihood. Further, feeling that an error of judgment would prejudice his standing with the committee, he might well hesitate to take risks." [...] In 1925, Lord Hawke, then the Yorkshire president, expressing his hope that an amateur would always be available to captain the national side, had made the impromptu comment, [...] "Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England." [...] His remarks were widely reported in the press and heavily criticised. This was to leave Hawke in an awkward situation in 1927.|$|E

500|$|A {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Newton's article, Lerone Bennett responded with an essay on the film in Ebony, titled [...] "The Emancipation Orgasm: Sweetback in Wonderland," [...] in which he discussed the film's [...] "black aesthetic". Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that [...] "some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes." [...] Bennett concluded that the film is [...] "neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation." [...] Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the [...] "rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute." [...] Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as [...] "emancipation orgasms" [...] and stated that [...] "it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> black people in 1971 {{that they are going to}} be able to screw their way across the Red Sea.

500|$|In 1808, Cuvier {{identified}} a fossil found in Maastricht {{as a giant}} marine reptile that would later be named Mosasaurus. He also identified, from a drawing, another fossil found in Bavaria as a flying reptile and named it Pterodactylus. He speculated, based on the strata in which these fossils were found, that large reptiles had lived prior {{to what he was}} calling [...] "the age of mammals". Cuvier's speculation would be supported by a series of finds that would be made in Great Britain {{over the course of the}} next two decades. Mary Anning, a professional fossil collector since age eleven, collected the fossils of a number of marine reptiles from the Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis. These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized as such, which was collected in 1811, and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found in 1821 and 1823. Many of her discoveries would be described scientifically by the geologists William Conybeare, Henry De la Beche, and William Buckland. It was Anning who observed that stony objects known as [...] "bezoar stones" [...] were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons, and she noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. This led her <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> Buckland that they were fossilized feces, which he named coprolites, and which he used to better understand ancient food chains.|$|E
