500|$|When Hopkins {{began to}} {{circulate}} cassette {{copies of the}} album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to Select journalist Mark Perry, [...] "not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the short tracks of Backspacer, Lightning Bolt features longer songs and a more experimental sound that McCready declared to aim for [...] "a logical extension of what Backspacer was". Stone Gossard added that the band being {{more comfortable with the}} composing and recording process lead to [...] "a slight return to some of the more sort of peculiar <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> say, between No Code and Binaural." [...] McCready said that [...] "there's a Pink Floyd vibe to some of it, there's a punk rock edge to other stuff", with the lead singles [...] "Mind Your Manners" [...] and [...] "Sirens" [...] being inspired by the Dead Kennedys and a concert in Roger Waters' The Wall Live, respectively. Neil Young was noted as an influence in [...] "Yellow Moon". O'Brien considered the track listing to have [...] "a lot of drama" [...] from the intensity of the musicians' work, but that the band itself were united and enjoying themselves during the creation process. According to Gossard, the album's simpler arrangements, [...] "sussed out" [...] songwriting and less production than in Backspacer made for songs that were easier to learn and play live. One of the tracks, [...] "Sleeping by Myself", had been previously featured in Vedder's 2011 solo album Ukulele Songs. O'Brien suggested the re-recording as he thought that the composition was [...] "a Pearl Jam song as far as I’m concerned." [...] Another, [...] "Pendulum", was originally composed during the Backspacer sessions.|$|E
500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

In test kitchens at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes. Walter Meyer, executive chef for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, [...] "A few <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> need to change, {{but most of}} the time people kept telling us, 'Do your own thing.

2500|$|After the attack, the UVF {{issued a}} statement: [...] "This {{was not a}} sectarian attack on the Catholic community, but was an {{operation}} directed at the very roots of the Provisional I.R.A. command structure in the Armagh–Tyrone area". The statement concluded with the promise that [...] "if the Provisional IRA were to cease its campaign of terror, the Ulster Volunteer Force would no longer deem it necessary to continue with their military operations". Privately the UVF were hugely pleased with the attack in a republican heartland and a senior figure Billy Wright, [...] who was alleged to be involved, told Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald the killings were [...] "one of <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> militarily in thirty years.

2500|$|The {{visual effects}} and {{backgrounds}} {{for the film}} were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays. Marlon West, one of Disney's veteran animation visual effects supervisors, says about the production; [...] "Those guys had this bright idea to bring back hand-drawn animation, but everything had to be started again from the ground up. One of the first <b>things</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was focus on producing shorts, to help us re-introduce the 2D pipeline. I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short, How to Hook Up Your Home Theater. It was a real plus for the effects department, so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog." [...] The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop, {{and many of the}} architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Autodesk Maya. Much of the clean-up animation, digital ink-and-paint, and compositing were outsourced to third-party companies in Orlando, Florida (Premise Entertainment), Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Yowza Digital Animation), and Brooklin, São Paulo, Brazil (HGN Produções) ...|$|E

6000|$|And so it was. From {{that moment}} {{we set up}} an English Rudder Grange in the {{establishment}} which Pomona had thus rudely wrenched, as it were, from the claws of the British Lion.

The things you see on shore were in the small hold under the cabin that {{was used for the}} ship’s stores, while the main contains the cargo. We got at the lazarette from a hatch under the table of the cabin. It was not convenient, but it was an advantage having a separate place when we were loaded up with hides, and there was no fear of the sailors getting at the <b>things.</b> <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not carry a great store—five or six barrels of flour, a few sacks of potatoes and onions, a barrel or two of biscuits, and a couple of casks of salted meat, a barrel of coffee and one of sugar.” ...|$|E

Even I, Imber, do not now understand. Secretly we slew, and {{continued}} to slay, for with our years we were crafty and we had learned the swiftness of going without haste. When white men came among us with black looks and rough words, and took away six of the young men with irons binding them helpless, we knew we must slay wider and farther. And one by one we old men departed up river and down to the unknown lands. It was a brave thing. Old we were, and unafraid, but the fear of far places is a terrible fear to men who are old.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the steamer}} {{came up the}} river we were aware of first one {{elephant}} and then another hard at work in timber-yards that faced the shore. A few narrow-minded folk with binoculars {{said that there were}} mahouts upon their backs, but this was never clearly proven. I prefer to believe in what I saw--a sleepy town, just one house thick, scattered along a lovely stream and inhabited by slow, solemn elephants, building stockades for their own diversion. There was a strong scent of freshly sawn teak in the air--we could not see any elephants sawing--and occasionally the warm stillness was broken by the crash of the log. When the elephants had got an appetite for luncheon they loafed off in couples to their club, and did not take the trouble to give us greeting and the latest mail papers; at which we were much disappointed, but took heart when we saw upon a hill a large white pagoda surrounded by scores of little pagodas.
