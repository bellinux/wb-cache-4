500|$|On 2 April 1906, the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway, {{commonly}} known as the Alternative Route, opened to passengers. The new line linked Ashendon Junction on the Chiltern Main Line to the Great Central Railway at Grendon Underwood, a short distance northwest of Quainton Road. The Alternative Route crossed the Brill Tramway on a bridge at Wotton, and another station, also named [...] "Wotton", was built on the embankment immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. Although the lines did not connect, a <b>temporary</b> <b>siding</b> was built from the Brill Tramway onto the new embankment, and used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same stationmaster was responsible for both stations.|$|E
500|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the Great Central Railway and the Metropolitan Railway deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over MR lines from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the shaky goodwill of the MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway to create a second route into London. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR's existing station at Princes Risborough to the new Great Central line. The line ran from Princes Risborough north to meet the Great Central at Grendon Underwood, about [...] north of Quainton Road. The new line was to cross the Tramway on a bridge immediately east of Wotton station, although no intersection was built between the lines. Although the lines did not connect, a <b>temporary</b> <b>siding</b> was built from the Tramway onto the embankment of the new line, and used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line. Although formally an independent company, in practice the line was operated {{as a part of the}} Great Central Railway.|$|E

The line was open to Captain's Flat under construction conditions from 28 November 1939, however Mines Department records indicate that conveyance of concentrates from the mine began in October, 1939. The Captain's Flat line opened for general traffic on 17 June 1940 when the tri-weekly rail motor service began.|$|E

The declining situation continued through the 1950s, then Varteg Hill subsequently closed in 1964 leaving Big Pit as the primary exporter of coal left. The once double track to Pontypool was then singled in June 1965.

40|$|Informal {{payments}} for health services are widespread in many transition economies in post-communist Europe {{and the former}} Soviet Union. Their existence complements {{and in some cases}} significantly contributes to the financing of their health systems. It has been suggested that they are the legacy of planned socialist economies and a <b>temporary</b> <b>side</b> effect of the transition from a planned to a market economy. This article discusses the findings of the study investigating the extent and nature of the informal payments and evaluates the policy options on offer. It asserts that despite the level of declared support for moderate cost-sharing by different population groups, it is unlikely that any legalised form of co-payment will affect or replace informal payments, as the government uses them to sustain the illusion of ‘free’ health care. The study argues that the utilitarian gain maximisation principle, calling for the greatest collective welfare in communitarian egalitarianism, and the satisfaction of individual preferences in libertarian economics enable the acceptance of informal payments as a viable policy option. ...|$|R

5000|$|On 5 September 2014, a truck {{travelling}} on the Mitchell Highway {{rolled off}} a road bridge at Angellala Creek approximately 30km south of Charleville (...) [...] The truck was carrying 52 tonnes of ammonium nitrate which exploded. The blast destroyed the two road bridges and severely damaged the adjacent rail bridge. The blast {{was so powerful}} that the truck was disintegrated and the dangers posed by the remaining ammonium nitrate necessitated a 2km exclusion zone around the site {{for a number of}} days.

40|$|Background: Tacrolimus is a T-cell-selective {{cytokine}} inhibitor. The topical formulationwas specifically {{developed for}} treating inflammatory skin diseases, includingatopic dermatitis (AD). The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the efficacyand safety of topically applied tacrolimus ointment (Protopic®) in treatingTaiwanese patients with moderate to severe AD. Methods: This was an open-labeled, non-comparative, single-center study. Enrolledpatients applied Protopic® twice daily for up to 4 weeks. Efficacy was evaluatedon the basis of the physician’s global evaluation of clinical response(PG). Other evaluations included the Eczema Area and Severity Index andthe percentage of body surface area; the total score for clinical signs wasused for evaluating the efficacy. A safety assessment was based on adverseevents reported by patients or observed by the physician. Blood was sampledfor the evaluation of tacrolimus levels. Results: In total, 30 patients (16 pediatric and 14 adult patients) with moderate tosevere AD were enrolled in this study. At the end of treatment, the PG was 92. 3 % for the pediatric group and 100 % for the adult group. Other efficacyevaluations also showed significant improvement. Two patients haddetectable blood tacrolimus concentrations. Skin itching and burning on theapplication site was a common but <b>temporary</b> <b>side</b> effect. No significantadverse events related to Protopic® were observed. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest that Protopic® ointment may be a safe andeffective therapy for treating patients at least 2 years of age with moderate tosevere AD...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{compares the}} {{efficacy}} of sublingual misoprostol versus intravenous oxytocin in reducing bleeding during and after cesarean delivery. Materials and methods: A randomized clinical trial conducted on 120 pregnant women at term (37 – 40  weeks) gestation scheduled for elective cesarean delivery, who were assigned to either sublingual misoprostol 400  μg or intravenous infusion of 20 units of oxytocin after delivery of the neonate. The main outcome measures were blood loss at and 2  hours after cesarean delivery, change in hematocrit value, need for any additional oxytocic drugs, and drug-related side effects. Results: The overall mean blood loss was significantly lower in the misoprostol group compared to the oxytocin group (490. 75  ±  159. 90  mL vs. 601. 08  ±  299. 49  mL; p =  0. 025). However, changes in hematocrit level (pre- and postpartum) was comparable between both groups. There {{was a need for}} additional oxytocic therapy in 16. 7 % and 23. 3 % after use of misoprostol and oxytocin, respectively (p =  0. 361). Incidence of side effects such as shivering and metallic taste were significantly higher in the misoprostol group compared to the oxytocin group (p <  0. 001). Conclusions: Sublingual misoprostol is more effective than intravenous infusion of oxytocin in reducing blood loss during and after cesarean delivery.
