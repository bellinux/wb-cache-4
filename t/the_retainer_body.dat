40|$|Objective: To compare {{two types}} of fixed {{orthodontic}} retainers (a multi-stranded wire retainer and a modified retainer) in relation to established periodontal parameters. <b>The</b> multi-stranded wire <b>retainer</b> is commonly used, and <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer</b> has bends to enable free access of dental floss to interproximal areas. Materials and Methods: For this crossover study, 12 volunteers were selected and used <b>the</b> following <b>retainers</b> for six months: (A) a multi-stranded wire retainer and (B) a modified retainer, both fixed to all anterior lower teeth. After this experimental period, the following evaluations were made: Dental Plaque Index, Gingival Index, Dental Calculus Index and Retainer Wire Calculus Index. The volunteers also responded to a questionnaire about the use, comfort and hygiene of <b>the</b> <b>retainers.</b> Results: <b>The</b> plaque index and the gingival index were higher on the lingual surfaces (p< 0. 05) for <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> calculus index was statistically higher (p< 0. 05) for the lingual and proximal faces when using <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>retainer</b> wire calculus index values were also significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer.</b> In <b>the</b> questionnaire, 58 % of the volunteers considered <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer</b> to be less comfortable and 54 % of them preferred <b>the</b> multi-stranded wire <b>retainer.</b> Conclusion: <b>The</b> multi-stranded wire <b>retainer</b> showed better results than <b>the</b> modified <b>retainer</b> according to <b>the</b> periodontal parameters evaluated, {{as well as providing}} greater comfort and being <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> preferred by <b>the</b> volunteers...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present a simple technique for stabilizing a lingual fixed retainer wire in place with good adaptation to the teeth surfaces and checking for occlusal interferences prior to the bonding procedure. BACKGROUND: Bonding of an upper or lower fixed lingual retainer using stainless steel wires of different sizes and shapes is a common orthodontic procedure. <b>The</b> <b>retainer</b> can be constructed in a dental laboratory, made at chair side, or it can be purchased in prefabricated form. All three ways of creating a fixed retainer are acceptable. However, the method of holding <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> wire in place adjacent to the lingual surfaces of the teeth before proceeding with the bonding process remains a problem for some practitioners. REPORT: <b>The</b> lingual fixed <b>retainer</b> was fabricated using three pieces of. 010 " steel ligature wire which were twisted into a single strand wire. Another four to five 0. 010 " pieces of steel ligature wires were twisted in the same way to serve as an anchor wire from the labial side of <b>the</b> teeth. <b>The</b> <b>retainer</b> wire was bonded using the foible composite. SUMMARY: The technique presented here for stabilizing <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> wire prior to bonding provides good stabilization, adaptation, and proper positioning of <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> wire while eliminating contamination of etched surfaces which might arise during wire positioning before bonding. This technique also allows the clinician the opportunity to check the occlusion and adjust <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> wire to avoid occlusal interference prior to bonding maxillary retainers. This same clinical strategy can be used to stabilize wires for splinting periodontally affected teeth and traumatized teeth. King Saud Universit...|$|R

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into <b>the</b> spring <b>retainer</b> (also known as a collar), this taper locks <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on <b>the</b> spring <b>retainer</b> which allows <b>the</b> collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, <b>the</b> <b>retainer,</b> spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free <b>the</b> <b>retainer</b> allowing <b>the</b> springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as <b>the</b> spring <b>retainer</b> rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R
