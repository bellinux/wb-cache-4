5|$|One of the {{earliest}} known monotremes was Teinolophos, which lived about 120 million years ago in Australia. Monotremes have some features which may be inherited from the original amniotes such as the same orifice <b>to</b> <b>urinate,</b> defecate and reproduce (cloaca) – as lizards and birds also do – and they lay eggs which are leathery and uncalcified.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

50|$|Another {{solution}} <b>to</b> <b>urinating</b> on long military patrols, {{especially in}} modern naval patrol craft where a pilot is {{strapped to his}} seat, {{is the use of}} a sponge-containing zipper storage bag, which is disposed {{at the end of the}} flight.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 217, Caracalla was at Edessa with a large army preparing {{to start a new}} invasion of Parthia. On 8April 217 Caracalla was travelling to visit a temple near Carrhae, now Harran in southern Turkey, where in 53BC the Romans had suffered a defeat {{at the hands of the}} Parthians. After stopping briefly <b>to</b> <b>urinate,</b> Caracalla was approached by a soldier, Justin Martialis, and stabbed to death. Martialis had been incensed by Caracalla's refusal to grant him the position of centurion, and the Praetorian Guard Prefect Macrinus, Caracalla's successor, saw the opportunity to use Martialis to end Caracalla's reign. In the immediate aftermath of Caracalla's death, his murderer, Martialis, was killed as well. Three days later, Macrinus declared himself emperor with the support of the Roman army.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 the 8th Battalion {{joined the}} British Army in France {{as part of}} the 3rd Canadian Division. At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault, {{involving}} the first use of poison gas in modern warfare. Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas, when he ordered his men <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise the chlorine. Lipsett's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade, which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines.|$|E
25|$|Most males prefer <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> {{standing}} {{while others}} prefer <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> sitting or squatting. Elderly males with prostate gland enlargement {{may benefit from}} sitting down while in healthy males, no difference {{is found in the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>urinate.</b> For practising Muslim men, the genital modesty of squatting is also associated with proper cleanliness requirements or awrah.|$|E
50|$|Hibernating {{bears are}} able to recycle their {{proteins}} and urine, allowing them both <b>to</b> stop <b>urinating</b> for months and to avoid muscle atrophy.|$|R

50|$|Problems {{that can}} arise include {{a small hole}} in the urinary channel below the meatus, called a fistula. The head of the penis, which is open at birth in {{children}} with hypospadias and is closed around the urinary channel at surgery, sometimes reopens, known as glans dehiscence. The new urinary opening can scar, resulting in meatal stenosis, or internal scarring can create a stricture, either of which cause partial blockage <b>to</b> <b>urinating.</b> If the new urinary channel balloons when urinating a child is diagnosed with a diverticulum.|$|R
25|$|In a 1995 {{episode of}} the first season of Friends, Chandler pesters Joey, while the latter tries <b>to</b> <b>urinate.</b> Joey begs Chandler to cease the disturbance, {{claiming}} {{that he needs to}} concentrate in order <b>to</b> <b>urinate.</b> In another episode, Monica is stung on the foot by a jellyfish, and Joey is unable <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> on it to soothe the pain, so Chandler comes to the rescue.|$|E

25|$|In many {{societies}} {{and in many}} social classes, even mentioning the need <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> {{is seen as a}} social transgression, despite it being a universal need. Even today, many adults avoid stating that they need <b>to</b> <b>urinate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} novelty of the ice itself Ice Bar Sub-zero has a {{competition}} to attract patrons as well. The competition, known as the Iceman (or most recently [...] "Ice person" [...] because of female contestants), involves staying in the bar {{for as long as}} the contestant can. Because the contestants cannot leave even to use the bathroom they often resort <b>to</b> <b>urinating</b> in bottles in the ice bar itself. If the challengers surpass the previous record holders time the bottles containing their urine are enshrined on the wall of Iceman winners.|$|R
5000|$|The three {{unidentified}} enlisted Marines {{who received}} the administrative punishments are all non-commissioned officers. Two of the Marines pleaded guilty to having violated a general order for [...] "wrongfully posing for an unofficial photograph with human casualties." [...] One of them pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>urinating</b> on the corpse of a Taliban fighter and another to having recorded the video. The third Marine, the highest ranking among the three NCO's, pleaded guilty to having [...] "failed to report the mistreatment of human casualties by other Marines" [...] and for having made a false statement about {{his knowledge of the}} event.|$|R

50|$|Another {{response}} is to privatise the toilets, so that a public good is provided by a contractor, just as private prisons are. The toilets may {{fall under the category}} of privately owned public space - anyone can use them, but the land ultimately belongs to the corporation in question. When toilets that have been privatised are improperly run, or closed, there may be calls to take them back into the control of the public authority, as with Westminster Council in central London - one of the wealthiest places in the world, where members of the public are reduced <b>to</b> <b>urinating</b> in the parks and streets for lack of available facilities.|$|R

5000|$|After Bentz {{returned}} to the United States, he released a statement August 19 about the incident. He started by stating [...] "I want to offer a sincere apology to the United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, the extraordinary women and men of Team USA, and the University of Georgia." [...] He continued with [...] "While I am anxious to put this matter behind me and rejoin my Georgia teammates in classes, practices and competitions, I feel compelled to stress several key points. 1. I was never {{a suspect in the}} case from the beginning (Brazilian law enforcement officials saw me only as a witness). 2. I never made a false statement to anyone at any time." [...] He went on detailing the incident to include admitting <b>to</b> <b>urinating</b> behind the gas station, and that Lochte pulled down a framed metal advertisement.|$|R

50|$|He {{added that}} the {{enforcement}} of such a law would be similar <b>to</b> laws banning <b>urinating</b> in public and would {{be treated as a}} minor offence.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{normally}} quite shy, but aggressive when harassed. It is reported <b>to</b> initially <b>urinate</b> or defecate on a threat and then, if teeth-baring and snarling does not deter the threat, it uses its powerful jaws and teeth in self-defense. Predation on adult binturong is reportedly quite rare by sympatric species like leopard, clouded leopard and reticulated python.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to his village, Rumata becomes annoyed when he discovers that Budakh, apparently a great doctor and intellectual, is actually a bumbling fool who is unable <b>to</b> even <b>urinate</b> properly. He sends Budakh away and retires to his castle. The next day, the Greys attack the castle and kill Ari. Enraged, Rumata butchers their leader.|$|R
25|$|In human females, the urethra opens {{straight}} into the vulva. Hence, urination can take place while sitting or squatting for defecation. It is also possible for females <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> while standing, and while clothed. It is common for women in various regions of Africa to use this method when they urinate, as do women in Laos. Herodotus described a similar custom in ancient Egypt. An alternative method for women <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> standing {{is to use a}} tool known as a female urination device to assist.|$|E
25|$|The bladder may rupture if overfilled and not emptied. This {{can occur}} {{in the case of}} binge {{drinkers}} having consumed very large quantities, but are not aware, due to stupor, of the need <b>to</b> <b>urinate.</b> This condition is very rare in women, but it does occur. Symptoms include localized pain and uraemia (poisoning due to reabsorbed waste). The recovery rate is high, with most fatalities due to septic blood poisoning. A person is more likely <b>to</b> <b>urinate</b> while passed out before the bladder ruptures, as alcohol relaxes the muscles that normally control their bladder.|$|E
25|$|A common {{technique}} {{used in many}} undeveloped nations involves holding the child by {{the backs of the}} thighs, above the ground, facing outward, in order <b>to</b> <b>urinate.</b>|$|E

Using the absorbed souls of the tourists, Scrappy transforms into a monster and tries to kill the gang.|$|R
50|$|A {{car wash}} attendant, Tommy, gets {{a call from}} an old {{acquaintance}} of his, Peter, who wants to stay at his place while he visits the city. Tommy agrees, and Peter shows up later along with his girlfriend, a heroin addict named Mary who takes to sleeping on a {{mattress on the floor}} of Tommy's room. Initially, Peter and Mary only prove to be a minor nuisance, as the morbidly obese Peter binge-eats all day and watches cartoons while Mary shoots up in the bedroom. One afternoon, however, Tommy comes home to discover a ten-year-old boy tied up in the bathtub; Peter explains that he owes money to a drug dealer named Spin, and explains that the child—whom he and Mary kidnapped from the mall—is part of a plan to raise money to pay off the debt. Tommy initially protests, prompting Peter to assault him. Tommy quickly grows too apathetic to intervene, and simply takes <b>to</b> <b>urinating</b> in his kitchen sink and defecating at a nearby gas station as a way to avoid the bathroom.|$|R
