5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> {{the upper}} part of the river, located in the Mourne Mountains, is {{composed}} of granite formed approximately 50 million years ago (mya). <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> the river as it flows through Tollymore is shale from the Silurian age, more than 400 mya, and it forms step gorges along some sections of the river banks. Dark bands of basalt are found were molten basalt lava was forced through cracks in the bedrock about 60 million years ago. The river bed contains stones and gravel from as far away as Antrim, Tyrone and Scotland, which were carried there by glacial ice sheets during the last ice age.|$|E

5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} metamorphic rocks derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old.

5|$|Generally <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> {{the west}} of the town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies to {{the west of}} the town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E

5|$|The Runcorn area drains {{into the}} River Mersey {{to the north}} and the River Weaver to the south. <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> the western and northeastern parts of the town is made up of rock from the Sherwood {{sandstone}} group; in the other areas the bedrock is from the Mercia mudstone group. In places there are prominent outcrops of sandstone, particularly at Runcorn Hill and Halton Hill. Elsewhere the bedrock is covered by drift. At the northwestern periphery of the town the drift consists of recently blown sand. Farther to the east and bordering the River Mersey is recent alluvium. Elsewhere the drift consists of till.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Loch Snizort to {{the west}} of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish is {{separated}} from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of Isay. The loch is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 295metres (967ft) at Waterstein Head. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands. Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Oceanic crust, {{which forms}} <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> abyssal plains, is {{continuously}} being created at mid-ocean ridges (a type of divergent boundary) {{by a process}} known as decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean ridges. This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust. Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest oceanic crust is at the mid-ocean ridges, and it becomes progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan broke {{new ground}} in Australian {{politics}} with his policies on native title for Aborigines. The North West Aboriginal Reserve (NWAR) covered more than 7% of the state's land, and was inhabited by the Pitjantjatjara people. In 1977, when the NWAR {{was about to}} be transferred to the Aboriginal Lands Trust, a tribal delegation asked for the lands to be given to the traditional owners. Dunstan agreed to an investigation, and subsequently introduced the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill. This bill proposed for a tribal body, the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku, {{to take control of the}} NWAR and further lands after the claims were cleared by an independent tribunal. It also proposed to allow the body to decide mining proposals on the land and receive royalties. This aroused discontent among mining interests, but a bipartisan parliamentary committee endorsed the bill and it was tabled. However, Labor lost power before the bill was passed and although the new Liberal government said they would remove the mining restrictions, mass public rallies forced them to relent, and a bill similar to Dunstan's was passed. The legislation, <b>the</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> which was laid by Dunstan, was the most reformist in Australia, and in the 1980s, more than 20% of the land was returned to its traditional owners.|$|E

25|$|Cheshire {{covers a}} boulder clay plain {{separating}} {{the hills of}} North Wales and the Peak District of Derbyshire (the area {{is also known as}} the Cheshire Gap). This was formed following the retreat of ice age glaciers which left the area dotted with kettle holes, locally referred to as meres. <b>The</b> <b>bedrock</b> <b>of</b> this region is almost entirely Triassic sandstone, outcrops of which have long been quarried, notably at Runcorn, providing the distinctive red stone for Liverpool Cathedral and Chester Cathedral.|$|E
