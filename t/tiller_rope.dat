60|$|Even Frank, anxious as he was, {{could not}} but feel {{satisfied}} {{as he looked}} at the water glancing past her side. She was heeling well over, and the rustle of water at her bow could be heard where they were standing near the tiller. Andrews, the best helmsman on board the yacht, held the <b>tiller</b> <b>rope,</b> and Perry was standing beside him.|$|E
60|$|The instant, however, {{that the}} {{cessation}} of fire informed the garrison the ship was captured, a tremendous cannonade was opened by the guns of the fortress. The lightning was flashing vividly, and this enabled the gunners to direct their aim upon the ship. Over and over again she was struck, and one shot destroyed the steering wheel, cut the <b>tiller</b> <b>rope,</b> and killed two men who were steering. The single sail was not sufficient to assist in steering her, and {{the men in the}} boats rowed with such energy that the ropes continually snapped.|$|E

60|$|They rowed that evening; {{the next}} came, {{and with it}} the {{necessity}} of rowing again. Then the next, and the next, Cytherea always sitting in the stern with the <b>tiller</b> <b>ropes</b> in her hand. The curves of her figure welded with those of the fragile boat in perfect continuation, as she girlishly yielded herself to its heaving and sinking, seeming to form with it an organic whole.|$|R
60|$|That evening, at nine o'clock, Bob {{embarked}} {{on board the}} fishing boat, at the New Mole. One of the governor's aides-de-camp accompanied him, to pass him through all the guards; and orders had been sent, to the officers {{in command of the}} various batteries, that the boat was not to be challenged. It was to show a light from a lantern, as it went along, in order that it might be known. The other two passengers and the boatmen had been sitting there since before gunfire, and they were glad enough when Bob came down and took his seat in the stern, taking the <b>tiller</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Position of coxswain. Boats {{are either}} coxless, bow-coxed (also called bowloaders), or stern-coxed. In coxless ("straight") boats, a {{steersman}} {{is responsible for}} steering by either use of a mechanism connecting one of his shoes by wire to the rudder—the swiveling of the shoe turns the rudder, or by using a hand controlled string, called a <b>tiller</b> <b>rope,</b> which {{is parallel to the}} gunwales or the boat, and controls the rudder in a similar fashion. Singles and doubles do not employ a rudder in competition; the oarsmen steer by increasing or decreasing pressure or length on one scull or the other. In competition, bow- and stern-coxed boats may race one another.|$|E
50|$|The {{steering}} gear of earlier ships's wheels sometimes {{consisted of a}} double wheel where each wheel {{was connected to the}} other with a wooden spindle that ran through a barrel or drum. The spindle was held up by two pedestals that rested on a wooden platform, often no more than a grate. A <b>tiller</b> <b>rope</b> or tiller chain (sometimes called a steering rope or steering chain) ran around the barrel in five or six loops and then down through two tiller rope/ chain slots {{at the top of the}} platform before connecting to two sheaves just below deck (one on either side of the ship's wheel) and thence out to a pair of pulleys before coming back together at the tiller and connecting to the ship's rudder. Movement of the wheels (which were connected and moved in unison) caused the <b>tiller</b> <b>rope</b> to wind in one of two directions and angled the tiller left or right. In a typical and intuitive arrangement, a forward-facing helmsman turning the wheel counterclockwise would cause the tiller to angle to starboard and therefore the rudder to swing to port causing the vessel to also turn to port (see animation). On many vessels the helmsman stood facing the rear of the ship with the ship's wheel before him and the rest of the ship behind him— this still meant that the direction of travel of the wheel at its apex corresponded to the direction of turn of the ship. Having two wheels connected by an axle allowed two people to take the helm in severe weather when one person alone might not have had enough strength to control the ship's movements.|$|E
5000|$|After Hopkins {{stripped}} the forts of their guns and all remaining ordnance, Alfred led the American fleet homeward from Nassau harbor on St. Patricks Day, March 17, {{the same day}} that British troops were evacuating Boston. On April 4, during the homeward voyage, Hopkins ships captured the six-gun British schooner Hawk and the eight-gun brig [...] Shortly after midnight on April 6, Hopkins encountered the 20-gun Glasgow. That British frigate—which was carrying dispatches telling of the British withdrawal—put up a fierce and skillful fight which enabled her to escape from her substantially more powerful American opponents. At the outset of the fray, fire from her cannon cut Alfreds <b>tiller</b> <b>ropes,</b> leaving Hopkins flagship unable to maneuver or to pursue effectively. The American ships did attempt to chase their fleeing enemy, but after dawn Glasgow disappeared over the horizon and safely reached Newport, Rhode Island.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just then a {{round shot}} carried away our main-topmast {{with all her}} stun-s'ls an' booms. By good luck, however, we were close {{alongside}} o' the enemy's ship Redoubtable by that time. Our <b>tiller</b> <b>ropes</b> were shot away too, but it didn't matter much now. The word was given, and we opened with both broadsides at once. You should have felt the Victory tremble, John Adams. We tackled the Redoubtable with the starboard guns, and the Bucentaur and Santissima Trinidad with the port guns. Of course they gave it us hot and strong in reply. At the same time Captain Hardy, in the Temeraire, fell on board the Redoubtable on her other side, and the Fougueux, another o' the enemy, fell on board the Temeraire; so there we were four ships abreast--a compact tier-- blazin' into each other like mad, with the muzzles of the guns touchin' the sides when they were run out, an' men stationed with buckets at the ports, to throw water into the shot-holes to prevent their takin' fire.|$|R
6000|$|The VICTORY {{had not yet}} {{returned}} a single gun: fifty of her men had been by this time killed or wounded, and her main-top-mast, with all her studding-sails and her booms, shot away. Nelson declared, that, in all his battles, he had seen nothing which surpassed the cool courage of his crew on this occasion. At four minutes after twelve she opened her fire {{from both sides of}} her deck. It was not possible to break the enemy's line without running on board one of their ships: Hardy informed him of this, and asked him which he would prefer. Nelson replied: [...] "Take your choice, Hardy, it does not signify much." [...] The master was ordered to put the helm to port, and the VICTORY ran on board the REDOUTABLE, just as her <b>tiller</b> <b>ropes</b> were shot away. The French ship received her with a broadside; then instantly let down her lower-deck ports, for fear of being bearded through them, and never afterwards fired a great gun during the action. Her tops, like those of all the enemy's ships, were filled with riflemen. Nelson never placed musketry in his tops; he had a strong dislike to the practice; not merely because it endangers setting fire to the sails, but also because it is a murderous sort of warfare, by which individuals may suffer, and a commander now and then be picked off; but which never can decide the fate of a general engagement.|$|R
50|$|Copper voice pipes {{were being}} fitted to British two and three-deck {{warships}} {{as early as}} 1803. A notable use was on board HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Victory's ship's wheel was shot away early in the battle. A voice tube was then used to carry steering orders from the quarterdeck down three decks, to where a gang of sailors operated the ship's <b>tiller</b> directly using <b>ropes</b> and pulleys.|$|R
60|$|He had no {{difficulty}} in climbing on board, and after dressing {{himself in the}} clothes he had worn at Tripoli, and had kept on underneath the Arab attire, he pulled the head rope until the craft was nearly over the anchor. He then loosened the line that brailed up the sail, got the stone that served as an anchor on board, hauled the sheet aft, and took his place at the tiller. The wind had dropped a good deal with the sun, {{but there was still}} sufficient air to send the light craft fast through the water. He steered out for a time, and then, when he thought himself a good mile from the shore, headed east. By the appearance of the water as it glanced past, he thought that he must be making from five to six miles an hour, and when the sun rose at five o'clock, believed that he was nearly forty miles on his way. He now fastened the <b>tiller</b> with a <b>rope</b> and proceeded to overhaul the craft.|$|R
60|$|Just then a sea rose on {{the weather}} quarter, threatening, apparently, to fall inboard. So many waves {{had done the same}} thing before, that no one seemed to regard it much; but the {{experienced}} eye of the skipper noticed a difference, and he had barely time to give a warning shout when the wave rushed over the side like a mighty river, and swept the deck from stem to stern. Many loose articles were swept away and lost, and the boat which lay on the deck alongside of the mast, had a narrow escape. Billy and his friend Luke, being well under the lee of the bulwarks, escaped the full force of the deluge, but Ned Spivin, who steered, was all but torn from his position, though he clung with all his strength to the <b>tiller</b> and the <b>rope</b> that held it fast. The skipper was under the partial shelter of the mizzenmast, and clung to the belaying-pins. John Gunter {{was the only one who}} came to grief. He was dashed with great violence to leeward, but held on to the shrouds for his life. The mate was below at the moment and so was Zulu, whose howl coming from the cabin, coupled with a hiss of water in the fire, told that he had suffered from the shock.|$|R
6000|$|It {{had been}} part of Nelson's prayer that the British fleet might be {{distinguished}} by humanity in the victory which he expected. Setting an example himself, he twice gave orders to cease firing upon the REDOUTABLE, supposing that she had struck, because her great guns were silent; for as she carried no flag, there were no means of instantly ascertaining the fact. From this ship, which he had thus twice spared, he received his death. A ball fired from her mizzen-top, which, in the then situation of the two vessels, was not more than fifteen yards from that part of the deck where he was standing, struck the epaulette on his left shoulder, about a quarter after one, just in the heat of action. He fell upon his face, on the spot which was covered with his poor secretary's blood. Hardy, who was a few steps from him, turning round, saw three men raising him up.--"They have done for me at last, Hardy," [...] said he.--"I hope not," [...] cried Hardy.--"Yes!" [...] he replied, [...] "my back-bone is shot through." [...] Yet even now, not for a moment losing his presence of mind, he observed, as they were carrying him down the ladder, that the <b>tiller</b> <b>ropes,</b> which had been shot away, were not yet replaced, and ordered that new ones should be rove immediately. Then, that he might not be seen by the crew, he took out his handkerchief, and covered his face and his stars. Had he but concealed these badges of honour from the enemy, England, perhaps, would not have had cause to receive with sorrow the news of the battle of Trafalgar. The cockpit was crowded with wounded and dying men, over whose bodies he was with some difficulty conveyed, and laid upon a pallet in the midshipmen's berth. It was soon perceived, upon examination, that the wound was mortal. This, however, was concealed from all except Captain Hardy, the chaplain, and the medical attendants. He himself being certain, from the sensation in his back, and the gush of blood he felt momently within his breast, that no human care could avail him, insisted that the surgeon should leave him, and attend to those to whom he might be useful; [...] "For," [...] said he, [...] "you can do nothing for me." [...] All that could be done was to fan him with paper, and frequently to give him lemonade to alleviate his intense thirst. He was in great pain, and expressed much anxiety for the event of the action, which now began to declare itself. As often as a ship struck, the crew of the VICTORY hurrahed; and at every hurrah a visible expression of joy gleamed in the eyes, and marked the countenance of the dying hero. But he became impatient to see Captain Hardy; and as that officer, though often sent for, could not leave the deck, Nelson feared that some fatal cause prevented him, and repeatedly cried, [...] "Will no one bring Hardy to me? He must be killed! He is surely dead!" [...] An hour and ten minutes elapsed from the time when Nelson received his wound before Hardy could come to him. They shook hands in silence, Hardy in vain struggling to repress the feelings of that most painful and yet sublimest moment. [...] "Well, Hardy," [...] said Nelson, [...] "how goes the day with us?"--"Very well," [...] replied Hardy; [...] "ten ships have struck, but five of the van have tacked, and show an intention to bear down upon the VICTORY, I have called two or three of our fresh ships round, and have no doubt of giving them a drubbing."--"I hope," [...] said Nelson, [...] "none of our ships have struck?" [...] Hardy answered, [...] "There was no fear of that." [...] Then, and not till then, Nelson spoke of himself. [...] "I am a dead man, Hardy," [...] said he: [...] "I am going fast: it will be all over with me soon. Come nearer to me. Let my dear Lady Hamilton have my hair, and all other things belonging to me." [...] Hardy observed that he hoped Mr. Beatty could yet hold out some prospect of life. [...] "Oh, no!" [...] he replied, [...] "it is impossible. My back is shot through. Beatty will tell you so." [...] Captain Hardy then, once more, shook hands with him; and, with a heart almost bursting, hastened upon deck.|$|R
