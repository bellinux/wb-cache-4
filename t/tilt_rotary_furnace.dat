40|$|This {{paper is}} closely {{connected}} with the complex problem of degradation relating to the refractories of <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace</b> linings {{in the production of}} zinc oxide. Zinc oxide can be produced by variety of ways, but the most common method of production which is used in Europe is indirect, i. e. pyrolytic combustion of zinc. This method is also called "French process" of manufacturing ZnO. But this mentioned method of preparation leads {{to the creation of the}} enormous amount of zinc slag including chemical complexes of elements Fe, Zn and Al. The mechanism of degradation of the lining leads to slag rests and it is closely {{connected with the}} mutual interaction of the aggressive agents with the components of the lining. This process creates a new undesired surface layer which increased the overall thickness of zinc slag. Stuck slag has the influence on rapid degradation of the linings and moreover it also decreases the production quality of ZnO.

The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991. The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony lead bullion from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55-65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace</b> when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated. The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h.

40|$|The {{utilisation}} {{of energy}} in waste, Waste to Energy (WtE), has become increasingly important. Waste is a wide concept, and to focus, the feedstock dealt with here is mostly municipal solid waste. It is found that combustion in grate-fired furnaces {{is by far the}} most common mode of fuel conversion compared to fluidized beds and <b>rotary</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Combinations of pyrolysis in <b>rotary</b> <b>furnace</b> or gasification in fluidized or fixed bed with high-temperature combustion are applied particularly in Japan in systems whose purpose is to melt ashes and destroy dioxins. Recently, also in Japan more emphasis is put on WtE. In countries with high heat demand, WtE in the form of heat and power can be quite efficient even in simple grate-fired systems, whereas in warm regions only electricity is generated, and for this product the efficiency of boilers (the steam data) is limited by corrosion from the flue gas. However, combination of cleaned gas from gasification with combustion provides a means to enhance the efficiency of electricity production considerably. Finally, the impact of sorting on the properties of the waste to be fed to boilers or gasifiers is discussed. The description intends to be general, but examples are mostly taken from Europe...|$|R
