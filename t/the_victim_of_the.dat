5|$|In 1989, {{seven years}} after his arrest in 1982, Andrew Wilson filed a civil suit against four detectives (including Burge), a former police superintendent, and the City of Chicago. He {{said that he had}} been beaten, suffocated with a plastic bag, burned (by {{cigarette}} and radiator), and treated with electric shock by police officers when interrogated about the February 1982 murders; he also had been <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pattern of a police and city cover-up.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, The Flight of the Eagle. Sundman portrays Andrée as <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{demands of the}} media and the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage. Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national culture, {{and the role of the}} press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell. It was nominated for an Oscar.|$|E

50|$|The Srebrenica Genocide Memorial, officially {{known as}} the Srebrenica-Potočari Memorial and Cemetery for <b>the</b> <b>Victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1995 Genocide, is the memorial-cemetery complex in Srebrenica set up to honour <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1995 Srebrenica genocide. The victims—at least 8,372 of them—were mainly males, mostly Bosniaks and some Croats.|$|R
5|$|Braham {{was awarded}} the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943. Four nights later, on the 28/29 September whilst {{carrying}} out an intruder operation between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight. He downed the enemy aircraft which hit the ground and exploded. He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby. One source suggests <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash was German ace Hans-Dieter Frank (55 victories), flying a Heinkel He 219, who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham. The very next night he claimed a Bf 110. His victim was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV/NJG 1 (53 victories). Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned. Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged. Frank, Vinke and Geiger were the 17th, 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War (and aerial warfare).|$|E
5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, {{a young man who}} had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the young man was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Gershkovitch became {{head of the}} Imperial Russian Army's {{military}} symphony orchestra, {{a position}} he held through the Russian Revolution. Army duties continued after the war as concerts were often given as benefits for orphans and the Red Cross, and {{it was during this}} period that Gershkovitch met his future wife Lucia. Then an engineer working on a construction project near Khabarovsk, she had previously been a piano student at the Conservatory during the same period Gershkovitch was there. The two met in 1917, and in 1918 they married in Irkutsk. In Irkutsk, he organized a fine arts conservatory and symphony orchestra. The institute was successful, and by 1920 enrollment had reached more than 1,550 students. Following a successful takeover of the city by the Bolsheviks, Gershkovitch conducted bands for funeral services under the new regime. During a service rehearsal, Gershkovitch removed a man causing numerous interruptions. As a result, Gershkovitch was commanded to visit the Cheka, the presiding chief of which was <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous day's incident. However, the chief was a devotee of music and requested that Gershkovitch produce a grand opera. He provided a collection of musical instruments previously confiscated by the Bolsheviks. Gershkovitch's conservatory, orchestra, and newly established opera continued under the Bolshevik regime.|$|E
40|$|Using household-level data, {{we explore}} the {{relationship}} between donations to <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and other charitable donations. The empirical evidence suggests that donations specifically for <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tsunami are positively associated with the amount previously donated to other charitable causes, which accords with complementary rather than substitution effects. This relationship exists when we decompose overall charitable donations into different types of philanthropy, with charitable contributions to caring, needy and religious organizations having the largest positive association with donations to <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tsunami. When we explore <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> donations to <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tsunami on future donations to charity, however, our findings suggest an inverse relationship with the largest inverse association with donations to needy and caring organizations. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{script was}} jointly written by Kumar and David Brooks Miller. In order {{to present the}} correct {{technical}} and medical facts in the film, Kumar analysed documents of the court proceedings, forensic evidences and interviewed several survivors of the tragedy and also the staff members of the Union Carbide plant. Bhopal Group for Information and Action and many activists fighting {{for the rights of}} <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disaster wanted to stop the film's screening, called it an insult to the victims, blamed the filmmakers of distorting the facts related to the disaster, diverting attention from Dow Chemical Company which acquired Union Carbide in 2001 and for portraying Anderson as a person who wanted to help the people but was unable to do so. Sheen denied these allegations and said that he did not sympathise for Anderson. Kumar also denied these allegations and said that the organisations had seen an older script. He added that making the film was a life-changing experience for him. A Prayer for Rain was added to the film's title because had it rained on the night of 2—3 December 1984, fewer people would have died.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{argument}} that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state.

25|$|Confession of sins is made {{directly}} to God and not through man (except in asking for forgiveness from <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sin). It is taught that sins {{are to be}} kept to oneself to seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit to themselves not to repeat the sin, although some sins in which another person is victimized are not forgiven unless that person forgives you, so they should also be asked for forgiveness.|$|E
25|$|In May, {{this was}} {{followed}} by the arrest of most members of the military Supreme Command and mass arrests throughout the military, often on fabricated charges.

25|$|The GM's {{merger with}} the Alton Railroad in 1947 brought several {{changes to the}} Gulf Coast Rebel.

Both the Little and Big Rebels were <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worsening passenger market in the 1950s.

25|$|The {{person who}} commits {{the act is}} called a tortfeasor.

25|$|In 1631, the Dutch West India Company (WIC) {{suspended}} Minuit {{from his}} post {{for reasons that are}} unclear, but probably for (perhaps unintentionally) abetting the landowning patroons who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against the interests and orders of the West India Company. He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions, but was dismissed and was succeeded as director by Wouter van Twiller.
