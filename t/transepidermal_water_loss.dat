Damage from mechanical stressors {{was believed to be}} the only way to increase its permeability. Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the <b>transepidermal</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability. The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E

40|$|Griseofulvin, an orally {{effective}} antimicrobial agent, {{appears in}} the stratum corneum within 4 - 8 h after oral administration. Griseofulvin distribution {{was found to be}} highest in the outermost layers of the stratum corneum (level I, 20. 8 ± 1. 5 ng/mg) and lowest inside (level II, 10. 0 ± 1. 5; level III, 7. 5 ± 2. 2 ng/mg). In order to study the precise mechanism of griseofulvin transfer to stratum corneum, the role of sweat in the accumulation of griseofulvin was considered. Heat-induced total body sweating decreased the mean stratum corneum concentration of griseofulvin by 55 %, and 200 - 300 ng of griseofulvin accumulated per ml of sweat. A silicone hydrophobic resin was used to differentiate between “wash-off” and carrier properties of sweat for griseofulvin. Prevention of <b>transepidermal</b> <b>water</b> and sweat <b>loss</b> by (a) topical application of formaldehyde-releasing cream to one palm, (b) occlusion by a 2 × 2 -cm patch on one arm, and (c) wearing a rubber glove for 24 h, showed a lower griseofulvin concentration when compared to control areas in the same subjects. The results of the gloved hand experiment show that a complete equilibrium is established at all three levels of stratum corneum, thereby removing the reversed gradient. These results support the hypothesis that a “wick effect” is responsible for the observed reversed drug gradient within the stratum corneum.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the discontinuous ventilation cycle (DVC) observed in many insects, including all ants described to date, is an adaptation to reduce respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to measure respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> as a percentage of total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> and to estimate what sustained rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> would be in the absence of spiracular control. We used two independent techniques to measure real-time <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in female alates of Pogonomyrmex rugosus. The first measured water vapor emission and CO 2 production simultaneously using dual-wavelength infrared absorbance analysis (DWIRAA). The second measured <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> gravimetrically. Real-time measurement allowed the separation of cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates (interburst) from <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates during the ventilation phase (burst) of the DVC. Cuticular permeability of P. rugosusfemale alates was only 27 ngh 21 cm 22 Pa 21, one-third of that reported for workers of the same species and the lowest yet reported for ants. Partly because of this low cuticular permeability, respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> represented a greater percentage of overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (13 %) than has generally been reported for other insects. The DWIRAA and gravimetric techniques gave equivalent results. Peak rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> during the burst phase were 2. 8 -fold higher than cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates alone (7. 68 mgg 21 h 21 versus 2. 77 mg 21 h 21 at 25 ˚C). This is a conservative estimate of <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in the absence of spiracular control. Contrary to findings in certain other insects that suggest a negligible role for respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> we find that, in an insect that employs the DVC and has low cuticular permeability, overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates rise several-fold in the absence of direct spiracular control.

This research compared gravimetric <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (extimated with load cells) of four containerized landscape tree species with <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> estimated with TDPs. Over a 66 day period, an experiment compared <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> of three established, 5. 0 cm (2 in) caliper poplar (Populus nigra 2 ̆ 7 Italica 2 ̆ 7) trees in 75 -liter (20 gal) containers on load cells to TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> Each tree had a single 30 mm (1. 2 inch) TDP inserted into the trunk at four heights above soil level (15, 30, 45, and 60 cm (6, 12, 18, and 24 in, respectively)). Data revealed TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> was less than load cell estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> regardless of TDP height, but TDP estimated <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> at the 30 cm height was closes to actual load cell estimated tree <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> Over the next three years, similar sized Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana 2 ̆ 7 Bradford 2 ̆ 7), English oak (Quercus robur x Q. bicolor 2 ̆ 7 Asjes 2 ̆ 7), poplar (Populus deltoides 2 ̆ 7 Siouxland 2 ̆ 7), and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua 2 ̆ 7 Rotundiloba 2 ̆ 7) trees in containers were placed on load cells and one 30 mm TDP was placed into the trunk of each tree 30 cm above soil level. Over an extended time period, tree <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> was estimaged using load cells and TDPs.

40|$|Respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> in insects is a {{controversial}} topic. Whilst earlier studies considered respiratory transpiration a significant component of overall <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> {{to the extent}} that it was thought to be responsible not only for the evolution of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) but also for variation in DGC patterns, later work repeatedly questioned its importance. In particular, investigations of the proportional contribution of respiratory transpiration to total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> in species showing DGCs suggested that respiratory transpiration was unlikely to be important in these species. In turn, these studies have been criticized on analytical grounds. In this study we investigated variation in cuticular and respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates in five Scarabaeus dung beetle species, all of which show discontinuous gas exchange cycles, to ascertain the significance of respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> using modern analytical techniques. In particular, we determined whether there is variation in <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates amongst these beetles, whether both respiratory and cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rates contribute significantly to variation in the former, and whether metabolic rate variation and variation in the duration of the DGC periods contribute significantly to variation in respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. Total <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate varied such that species from arid areas had the lowest rates of <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> and both cuticular and spiracular transpiration contributed significantly to variation in overall <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. Moreover, variation in metabolic rate and in the duration of the DGC periods contributed significantly to variation in respiratory <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> rate. By contrast, examination of proportional <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> revealed little other than that it varies between 6. 5 % and 21 %, depending on the species and the temperature at which it was examined.

40|$|Summary To {{determine}} normal {{levels of}} <b>transepidermal</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> (TEWL), capacitance and sebum according to different sex and age groups, 93 healthy subjects were studied at 14 different anatomical locations {{with three different}} instruments: the Evaporimeter EP 1, the Corneometer CM 820, and the Sebumeter SM 810, evaluating respectively the <b>transepidermal</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss,</b> the capacitance and the causal level of sebum. Differences depending on the anatomical site were noticed. Unlike the capacitance, the <b>transepidermal</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> and the causal level of sebum significantly decreased according to age. Furthermore, in some sites, male subjects showed a significantly higher <b>transepidermal</b> <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> than females, while hydration of the horny layer expressed by the capacitance showed an opposite trend. Correlations between the above-mentioned skin parameters were calculated: {{a positive correlation between}} TEWL and hydration was observed only at plantar and palmar area...|$|E

Once a species-specific critical temperature (Tc) is reached, as temperatures continue to increase, rapid <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> occurs. The “lipid melting model” is used to explain this sudden increase in {{the rate of}} <b>water</b> <b>loss.</b> [...] The lipid melting model states that increased cuticular <b>water</b> <b>loss</b> {{is directly related to the}} melting of surface lipids. [...] Insects already adapted to more arid environments have a higher Tc; that is, their cuticular properties change and lipid structures melt at a higher critical temperature.|$|R

The major part of water supply companies {{does not have enough}} experience in reducing water losses; therefore, a lack of information about practically applied measures for reducing <b>water</b> <b>losses</b> can be noticed. The article presents a method for determining <b>water</b> <b>losses</b> implemented under real conditions. The conducted research defines minimum night-time water consumption for a single user, which is 0. 9 L/h/user and presents a methodology for calculating unavoidable background and real <b>water</b> <b>losses</b> that may occur in the water supply network. The above described method for detecting <b>water</b> <b>losses</b> has been practically tested in several water supply systems in Lithuania. Article in Lithuanin</p...|$|R
