5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first man into space) motivated President John F.

5|$|In 1919 John Scott {{decided to}} sell the island and castle; the local mayor, Alfred Barrow, intervened and the {{following}} the year the Duke instead agreed to give the castle and island to the local authorities as a memorial {{to those who had}} lost their life in World War I. The castle passed into the care of central government in 1973, and is now controlled by English Heritage, who operate the site as a tourist attraction. An archaeological survey was commissioned by English Heritage in 1984, carried out by Rachel Newman of Lancaster University; the findings of the survey led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> of restoration work, completed in 1991. It is protected by law as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The wage {{reform was}} linked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b> that reduced {{the length of}} the overall working week in the Soviet Union, and in 1958, the working week was reduced from 48 hours to 41. This was to apply to all Soviet workers, and by 1961, 40 million Soviet workers (approximately two thirds of the workforce) were working a 41-hour week. It was planned to {{decrease}} this further to 40 hours in 1962, but this was eventually not carried out. Khrushchev had stated a longer-term aim of giving Soviet workers the shortest working hours in the world, aiming for a 30- to 35-hour week by 1968. He had spoken previously of the reduction of working hours as a basic goal of a communist movement and had hoped that communism would eventually achieve a working day of 3–4 hours.|$|E
