5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. <b>The</b> <b>lava</b> emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (<b>the</b> <b>lava</b> is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a glassy crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} detailed petrography, mineral analyses, and wholerock {{major and}} trance element {{analyses of the}} Kilauea Volcano summit lavas erupted in April and September 1982. It supplements earlier U. S. Geological Survey wet chemical major element analyses of the rocks. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the petrologic process(es) responsible for chemical variations in <b>the</b> <b>lavas,</b> and compare <b>the</b> chemistry of <b>the</b> 1982 <b>lavas</b> to those of previous Kilauea summit eruptions. The result show that <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> erupted in April are chemically homogeneous. <b>Lavas</b> from <b>the</b> shorter but more voluminous September eruption vary systematically during the eruption from higher to lower MgO content. Computer modeling of the geochemical data indicates that olivine with minor clinopyroxene fractionation is probably responsible for <b>the</b> variation in <b>lava</b> compositions. <b>The</b> nearly aphyric nature of <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> negates <b>the</b> possibility of olivine accumulation to explain the variation. Magma mixing in also an unlikely mechanism because the variations are nonlinear. <b>The</b> <b>lavas</b> from <b>the</b> two 1982 eruptions may be related to a common parental magma, although there are some differences in Ni between the magmas. <b>The</b> April <b>lavas</b> are very similar in composition to other historic <b>lavas</b> erupted in <b>the</b> central area of Kilauea caldera.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Low-grade {{alteration}} of basaltic lavas at Teigarhorn, eastern Iceland, resulted in three distinct stages of mineral paragenesis that correlate to {{events in the}} burial and intrusive history of Icelandic crust. Metasomatism and brittle deformation during the paragenetic stages dramatically affected the paleo-hydrology of <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> and formed temporally distinct mineral assemblages. <b>The</b> <b>lavas</b> initially contained up to 22 percent total porosity concentrated near the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Celadonite and silica (Stage I) precipi-tated along the walls of primary pores prior to deep burial of <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> and occluded 8 percent of the initial porosity. During burial (Stage II), hydrolysis of olivine and basaltic glass {{led to the formation}} of mixed-layer chlorite/smectite clays in the matrix of <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> and as rims filling 40 percent of the volume of primary pores. Chlorite contents in Stage II mixed-layer clay rims increased from 20 to 80 percent during the infilling of individual vesicles, reflecting increas-ing temperatures with time as <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> were buried. <b>The</b> end of Stage II occurred after burial and is represented by filling of 40 percent of total primary porosit...|$|R

5|$|The Crater Glacier (also {{known as}} Tulutson Glacier) is a geologically young glacier that {{is located on}} Mount St. Helens, in the U.S. state of Washington. The glacier formed after the 1980 Eruption and due to its location, the body of ice grew rapidly, unknown {{to the public for}} nearly 20 years. The glacier once {{contained}} ice caves in the smooth ice before the 2004-2008 volcanic activity. The growth of <b>the</b> <b>lava</b> dome and volcanic eruptions from 2004 to 2008 significantly altered the appearance of the glacier. In the same time period, several agencies decided to put an official name on the glacier which, at first, was Tulutson Glacier. A later decision made Crater Glacier the official glacier name. Despite the volcanic activity, the glacier continued to advance and by mid-2008, the glacier completely encircled <b>the</b> <b>lava</b> domes. In addition, new glaciers (rock or ice) have formed around Crater Glacier as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of <b>the</b> <b>lava</b> shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and <b>the</b> <b>lava</b> flows become more effusive and thicken as <b>the</b> <b>lava</b> cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|This {{life cycle}} {{consists}} of several stages. The first stage is the submarine preshield stage, currently represented solely by Lōʻihi Seamount. During this stage, the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions. The sea's pressure prevents explosive eruptions. The cold water quickly solidifies <b>the</b> <b>lava,</b> producing the pillow lava that {{is typical of}} underwater volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Explosive eruptions may {{decrease}} and {{be followed}} by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If <b>the</b> <b>lava</b> dome continues to grow, it would eventually rise above the crater rim. <b>The</b> <b>lava</b> would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. Tephra swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows, explosions and eruption columns. The community of Squamish would be abandoned, Highway 99 {{would be out of}} service and destroyed, and traffic adjacent to Vancouver, Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99.|$|E

5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes {{that the}} events in Völuspá {{occurring}} {{after the death of}} the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland.

Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears them say that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo.

5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>lavas</b> and {{pyroclastics}} of Ascension Island {{contain a}} suite of coarse grained igneous blocks which range in composition from olivine-gabbro to peralkaline-granite paralleling, but extending beyond the compositional range of <b>the</b> volcanics. <b>The</b> <b>lavas</b> range from alkali-basalt through hawaiite, trachybasalt, trachyandesite and trachyte to comendite. True basalt is relatively rare {{and there is a}} scarcity of analyses with 57 No high pressure mineral assemblages and hence no possible mantle fragments have been found. Petrographic and isotopic data suggest that {{a suite of}} gabbros from Dark Slope Crater crystallised from a magma derived from a MORB-like source. The remaining blocks and all <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> evolved from magmas derived from a less depleted source. The chemical variation seen in <b>the</b> <b>lavas</b> and blocks is best explained by crystal fractionation mechanisms in a relatively shallow magma chamber. The gabbroic blocks exhibit cumulus textures suggesting that they formed by accumulation of settling crystals. The intermediate to acid blocks compare much more closely in composition with <b>the</b> evolved <b>lavas</b> and are probably their slowly cooled equivalents. There is petrographic evidence that partial melting of intermediate coarse grained material gave rise to melts of granitic composition but these are not chemically equivalent to <b>the</b> acid <b>lavas</b> and blocks. A pegmatoid body crystallised in situ and closed system crystal fractionation alone resulted in a very similar sequence of mineral assemblages to <b>the</b> blocks and <b>lavas</b> and a peralkaline final liquid. High 87 S 4 / 86 Sr ratios in <b>the</b> evolved <b>lavas</b> and blocks are attributable to contamination by a small quantity of highly radiogenic oceanic sediment. Comparison with other oceanic volcanoes suggests that these differentiation processes are much less important in determining the evolutionary path of the magma than its apparent starting composition. </p...|$|R
