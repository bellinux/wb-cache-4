She permits entry only after being given the correct password, as was distinguished in the third book, when Sirius Black tried forcing entry into the tower, only to be blocked by <b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> after he could not give the correct password. In the first book, Neville Longbottom tends to forget the password and must wait near the painting until other Gryffindors arrive to open the way.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Comic Relief {{performed}} a spoof story called Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan. It featured Dawn French {{as a female}} Harry; Jennifer Saunders as Ron Weasley and J. K. Rowling; Miranda Richardson (who later became Rita Skeeter in the Goblet of Fire film) as Hermione; Nigel Planer as Dumbledore (wearing the beard and costume of Richard Harris); Jeremy Irons as Professor Severus Snape; Alison Steadman as Minerva McGonagall; Ronnie Corbett as Hagrid and Basil Brush as Dobby the house elf. The broadcast of this parody was preceded by a message from J. K. Rowling. French subsequently received a role as <b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> in 2004's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. The end of Secret Chamberpot featured an advert for the sequel, Gobs of Fire, which was never made. It is unknown whether it was ever planned, {{or if it was}} just a spoof.|$|E
25|$|As an artist, Shovelton {{began with}} scraperboard and ink drawing and later turned to {{watercolour}} painting. He {{also became a}} skilled calligrapher. He designed posters, flyers and other artwork for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including the programme cover for the company's {{last night at the}} Adelphi Theatre, as well as for all the Gawsworth Hall productions. He created the book covers and illustrated poem collections by his former tutor and friend, the geographer Jay Appleton. Shovelton's cartoons graced the monthly newsletter of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, The Palace Peeper, for over three decades. Shovelton also created numerous Gilbert and Sullivan themed Christmas, greeting and note cards, and was a keen photographer. He provided the cover illustration for a novel by Tony Joseph, The Diary of April March, and illustrated two books of poetry by his former tutor at Hull, Jay Appleton (Grains Among the Chaff and Enter <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady)</b> and all three editions of Harry Benford's The Gilbert and Sullivan Lexicon (1978, 1991 and 1999).|$|E

To this the lean young lady retorted that it was with precisely similar reflection that she herself controlled her own feelings when tempted to resent <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> young <b>lady's</b> [...] "nasty jealous temper." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{decision}} was also criticized {{because of the}} popular stereotype that female opera singers have to be heavy anyway, {{in order to do}} a good job. There is the old expression that [...] "in opera, great voices often come in large packages". and the well-worn saying about opera that [...] "It ain't over till <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> sings". She was headlined in the British tabloid press as [...] "The show ain't over till <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> slims." [...] There was also an outcry because, it seemed at the time, that high culture performing arts, such as opera, should not emulate low culture Hollywood images of thin female stars.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{they had}} future hall of famers Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld on the team, the Bullets {{finished}} the 77–78 season 44–38 and were a longshot {{to win the}} NBA Finals, but San Antonio journalist Dan Cook used the famed phrase [...] "The opera ain't over 'til <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> sings". This became the rallying cry for the Bullets as they finished a playoff run {{that led to the}} NBA Finals, defeating the Seattle SuperSonics in seven games to bring a professional sports championship to Washington, D.C. {{for the first time in}} 36 years.|$|E
2500|$|The Fat Lady's portrait, which guards the Gryffindor quarters, {{is found}} ruined and empty.

During a stormy Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, dementors attack Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick. [...] At Hogsmeade, Harry is shocked to learn that not only had Sirius Black been his father's best friend and {{apparently}} betrayed them to Voldemort, but that Sirius is also his godfather. Lupin privately teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus Charm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{photographs}} and portraits {{in the world}} of wizards are not stationary like in the Muggle world. They move around within the frame and from one portrait to another, and are also able to talk if they are developed in a certain potion. A portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> is used in Hogwarts to cover the door to the Gryffindor common room and opens only when she is given the password. Also, there are various paintings of old Headmasters and Headmistresses of Hogwarts in Dumbledore's office, and he is shown to be in discussion with them from time to time. He also uses the portrait of Phineas Nigellus, Sirius Black's great grandfather, to communicate with Sirius and to keep a watch at the Order's Headquarters through another portrait of Phineas in the house. The headmaster portraits are special, not simply {{due to the fact that}} they appear in them because of their death. [...] The reason for this is that part of their soul stays behind in their portrait.|$|E
2500|$|After Tracy {{eventually}} made {{it on the}} show, there was a song [...] "The New Girl in Town", which was sung first by the Council girls and later by the black Girls. Although later cut early during the Seattle tryout, it {{was included in the}} 2007 film and appears in the show’s instrumental score. [...] "The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha" [...] was another cut number that originally followed [...] "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful". [...] Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene. A song called [...] "Step on Up" [...] was also cut in favor of [...] "I Know Where I’ve Been". Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a [...] "Miss Auto Show" [...] competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of [...] "Miss Teenage Hairspray". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called [...] "Take a Spin" [...] sung by Corny in the place where “(It’s) Hairspray” is now. After Amber’s rendition of [...] "Cooties", Tracy had a song before the finale called [...] "It Ain’t Over ’Til <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady</b> Sings," [...] though, it was cut after the third reading of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.|$|E

50|$|Some portraits {{are used}} to conceal the {{entrance}} of a room or passageway. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady's</b> portrait covers <b>the</b> entrance to the Gryffindor common room, and she can swing the portrait open when given the correct password or close to prevent entry. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, there is a portrait of Ariana Dumbledore in the Room of Requirement that conceals a secret passageway to the Hog's Head. There is also {{a painting of a}} large fruit bowl in front of the Hogwarts kitchen, which will swing open if the pear is tickled to reveal a hidden door.|$|R
5000|$|The single-panel gag cartoon (with longer-form comics on Sunday) was a daily look at Toonerville, {{situated}} in what are {{now called the}} suburbs. Central to the strip was the rickety little trolley called the [...] "Toonerville Trolley that met all the trains," [...] driven in a frenzy by the grizzly old Skipper to meet each commuter train as it arrived in town. A few of the many richly formed characters included the Terrible-Tempered Truman, the Physically Powerful Katrinka, Little Woo-Woo Wortle, Aunt Eppie Hogg (<b>The</b> <b>Fattest</b> <b>Lady</b> in 3 Counties) and Mickey McGuire, the town bully.|$|R

6000|$|The {{speaker was}} here {{interrupted}} by loud applause from his wife, and he profited by {{the opportunity to}} wipe a stray drop of perspiration from his fleshless face. Then, as <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> <b>lady</b> ceased the exertion of clapping her hands, he continued: ...|$|E

50|$|The brewery {{produces}} {{a range of}} well-hopped bitters, to distinguish itself from Theakston's range of fruity and yeasty beers. The brewery quickly became successful, and now produces over 75,000 barrels a year.

50|$|Dean {{joins the}} D.A. in his fifth year and also {{believes}} Harry and Dumbledore when {{they insist that}} Voldemort has returned; but, when Harry and Seamus engage in a heated row over the Daily Prophet's allegations that Harry had merely fabricated the story, Dean refuses to take sides.

The relationship eventually ends after Ginny becomes annoyed with Dean when she thinks he tries to help her through <b>The</b> <b>Fat</b> <b>Lady's</b> portrait hole. Harry, though jealous of the relationship from the start, is accidentally responsible for the split: under the Invisibility Cloak and the influence of Felix Felicis, he accidentally brushes Ginny as she and Dean pass through the portrait hole. Ginny thinks that Dean is being pushy and overprotective, which leads to the fight that ends their relationship.|$|R
