40|$|Volatile {{compounds}} (VCs) {{analysis was}} performed by solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Main groups that define typical cheese flavour formed {{as a result of}} the addition of a starter culture (SC). The cheesemaking environment, the type of milk (cow, ewe, goat), and the heat treatment of milk were observed. The SC had influenced the total amount of some fatty acids and ketones. Compared to cow and ewe cheeses, goat cheese had higher values of hexanoic and octanoic acids, however, two alcohols, 1 -hexanol, 2 -ethyl- and hexanol, were only present in cow cheeses. We confirmed that the cheesemaking environment is also an important parameter influencing VC profiles of cheese. Higher amount of esters and the absence of 2 -phenylethanol were observed in raw milk cheese, compared to <b>thermised</b> <b>milk</b> cheese where δ-octalactone was present...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{harbouring}} niches {{established in}} the processing plant support post-process contamination of dairy products made from pasteurised or <b>thermised</b> <b>milk.</b> The present study investigated L. monocytogenes environmental contamination in two sheep’s milk cheese-making plants. Persistence of contamination in the area at higher risk was also investigated. During a one-year survey 7 samplings were carried out in each dairy plant, along the production lines of Pecorino Romano and ricotta salata cheese. A total of 613 environmental samples collected from food contact and non-food contact surfaces were analysed according to ISO 11290 - 1 : 2005 standard method. Identification of the isolated strains {{was carried out by}} polymerase chain reaction. L. monocytogenes prevalence was 23. 2 % in dairy A and 13. 1 % in dairy B, respectively. The higher prevalence rate was found in the following areas: salting, products washing, packaging, ricotta salata storage and Pecorino Romano ripening rooms. L. monocytogenes was never found in the cheese-making area. The probability of observing samples positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes was asso- ciated with dairy plant, sampling area and the period of cheese-making (P Pecorino Romano ripening areas. The control of persistent environmental contamination relies on the identification of L. monocytogenes niches within the processing environment and the prevention of harborage sites formation. The importance of strict cleaning and sanitising procedure in controlling L. monocytogenes environmental contamination is confirmed by the lower level of contamination observed after these procedures were correctly implemented...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate, {{identify}} and select, with respect to acidification and proteolytic activities, the autochthonous mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in milk and Caciotta della Garfagnana, a cheese produced either with raw or thermised cow’s milk in small dairies and family plants of Garfagnana (Tuscany), to obtain LAB strains with attributes suitable to be employed as starter cultures in this type of cheese, particularly when <b>thermised</b> <b>milk</b> is used to control spoilage microflora. Samples of raw milk, curd and cheese were collected from three representative farmers of the production area and used to isolate autochthonous LAB. Phenotypic and genotypic (species-specific PCR assay) identification of isolated LAB was done. Twenty-eight strains of LAB isolated from milk, curd and cheese were screened for acidifying and proteolytic activities. LAB strains with the better attributes were used as mesophilic starter cultures in technological trials: experimental cheeses manufactured with the addition of autochthonous LAB and control cheeses were compared for LAB and pH evolution. Experimental cheeses presented a significant increase in the mesophilic lactic acid microflora up to 14 days of ripening and significantly lower pH values up to seven days of ripening. The use of wild selected mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, together with thermisation of milk, for the Caciotta della Garfagnana looks very promising and could help to both standardise the production and improve quality and traditional characteristics of this type of chees...|$|E

40|$|The {{isolation}} and identification of {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) from raw ewes’ milk and traditional Pecorino Sardo cheese made from this milk without the addition of starter culture was carried out to define the autochthonous lactic microflora present in milk {{and the evolution of}} LAB during cheese ripening. Isolation of 275 strains belonging to different Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Enterococcus species was achieved. Coccal-shaped LAB were found to predominate during cheese fermentation, while lactobacilli were preponderate during the latter phase of ripening. The technological selection of a total of 174 LAB strains belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lb. casei allowed an experimental starter to be prepared, in which a potentially probiotic species, Lb. casei was used. The suitability of the autochthonous starter culture was tested in cheese-making trials, using <b>thermised</b> ewes’ <b>milk,</b> by comparing experimental Pecorino Sardo cheese with a control cheese produced at industrial scale using a whey starter culture from previous batches of manufacture. In particular, microbiological and physicochemical parameters were determined over 210 days of cheese ripening. Although sensory evaluation did not show any significant difference between experimental and control Pecorino Sardo cheeses, the use of the selected autochthonous starter allowed the production of experimental cheese with a significantly higher level of free amino acids, in particular essential amino acids, in comparison with the Pecorino Sardo control cheeses...|$|R
40|$|Montasio {{cheese is}} a typical Italian semi-hard, semi-cooked cheese {{produced}} in northeastern Italy from unpasteurized (raw or <b>thermised)</b> cow <b>milk.</b> The Protected Designation of Origin label regulations for Montasio cheese require that local milk be used from twice-daily milking. The number of farms milking with automatic milking systems (AMS) has increased rapidly {{in the last few}} years in the Montasio production area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a variation in milking frequency, associated with the adoption of an automatic milking system, on milk quality and on the specific characteristics of Montasio cheese. Fourteen farms were chosen, all located in the Montasio production area, with an average herd size of 60 (Simmental, Holstein-Friesian, and Brown Swiss breeds). In 7 experimental farms, the cows were milked 3 times per day with an AMS, whereas in the other 7 control farms, cows were milked twice daily in conventional milking parlors (CMP). The study showed that the main components, the hygienic quality, and the cheese-making features of milk were not affected by the milking system adopted. In fact, the control and experimental milks did not reveal a statistically significant difference in fat, protein, and lactose contents; in the casein index; or in the HPLC profiles of casein and whey protein fractions. Milk from farms that used an AMS always showed somatic cell counts and total bacterial counts below the legal limits imposed by European Union regulations for raw milk. Finally, bulk milk clotting characteristics (clotting time, curd firmness, and time to curd firmness of 20 mm) did not differ between milk from AMS and milk from CMP. Montasio cheese was made from milk collected from the 2 groups of farms milking either with AMS or with CMP. Three different cheese-making trials were performed during the year at different times. As expected, considering the results of the milk analysis, the moisture, fat, and protein contents of the experimental and control cheeses were comparable. The milking system was not seen to significantly affect the biochemical processes associated with ripening. In fact, all cheeses showed a normal proteolysis trend and a characteristic volatile compound profile during aging. Therefore, the milking system does not appear to modify the distinctive characteristics of this cheese that remain dependent on the area and methodology of production...|$|R
40|$|Crossflow {{microfiltration}} (0. 1 μm) of {{skimmed milk}} {{is widely used}} in the dairy industry for the separation of casein micelles from soluble proteins. Microfiltration performance, {{both in terms of}} permeability and selectivity, are altered by the accumulation of casein micelles at the membrane surface, that turns into an irreversible deposit in Critical Hydrodynamic Conditions (CHC defined by (J/ w) crit with J : permeation flux, : shear stress at the membrane surface) [1]. Despite the main role of the casein micelle deposit on soluble protein transmission, little attention was paid to the impact of micelle deposit on membrane selectivity. Some studies have focused on the impact of physico-chemical characteristics of soluble proteins on their transmission during microfiltration of milk or dairy proteins suspensions. Others have focused on the impact of hydrodynamic conditions but none of them consider both simultaneously. Le Berre and Daufin (1998) [2] for instance, studied the soluble protein transfer considering the physico-chemical characteristics of individual proteins but this study was carried out under constant hydrodynamic conditions. Hence, this paper aims at understanding the transfer of soluble protein by taking into account both the hydrodynamic conditions of filtration and the physico-chemical characteristics of individual proteins. In that purpose, the transmission of the five major soluble proteins of milk was studied {{as a function of the}} hydrodynamic conditions of filtration in presence and in absence of the casein micelles. At pH= 6. 55 α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin and serum albumin bovine are negative charged, the immunoglobulins (IgG) are globally neutral and lactoferrin, LF is a positive protein. The present work was conducted on <b>thermised</b> skimmed <b>milk</b> (68 ± 1 °C, 25 s). MF was operated with a set-up equipped with the uniform transmembrane pressure system and with a 0. 1 μm tubular ceramic membrane. An original methodology of filtration based on step by step variation (decrease and successive increase) at constant permeation flux was used to determine deposit characteristics. This study clearly shows that the casein micelle deposit irreversibly alters soluble protein transmission and that the transmission of soluble proteins can be divided into three main groups. For negatively charged proteins, and in the absence of casein micelles deposit, the transmissions of proteins are mainly ruled by steric exclusion through the membrane and accumulated layers. In the presence of casein micelles deposit, the accumulation of micelles at the membrane surface results in a high density of negative charges at the membrane surface. Electrostatic repulsions between accumulated casein micelles and soluble proteins leads then to a significant decrease in transmission of negatively charged proteins. For lactoferrin (positively charged protein), the protein is entrapped in casein micelles deposit. This phenomenon is partially attributed to electrostatic interactions with casein micelles: an increase in ionic strength actually results in charge screening and in a sharp increase of its transmission. For neutral proteins, the transmission is mainly attributed to steric exclusion. Inthe presence of casein micelles deposit, the transmission of neutral proteins is increased due to increase in polarization concentration. For the first time this study shows that the transmission of proteins during microfiltration (in our case microfiltration 0. 1 μm of milk) can be partially explain by electrostatic effects between proteins to be transmitted and accumulated colloids at the membrane surface...|$|R
