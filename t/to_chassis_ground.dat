5000|$|The MIDI {{specification}} {{provides for}} a ground [...] "wire" [...] and a braid or foil shield, connected on pin 2, protecting the two signal-carrying conductors on pins 4 and 5. Although the MIDI cable is supposed to connect pin 2 and the braid or foil shield <b>to</b> <b>chassis</b> <b>ground,</b> it should do so only at the MIDI out port; the MIDI in port should leave pin 2 unconnected and isolated. Some large manufacturers of MIDI devices use modified MIDI in-only DIN 5-pin sockets with the metallic conductors intentionally omitted at pin positions 1, 2, and 3 so that the maximum voltage isolation is obtained.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 46) It is {{well known}} that many types of electronic devices are extremely sensitive to the presence of radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic interference (EMI). Electromagnetic interference affects a device either by conduction or radiation. In most cases, the first step in solving the EMI problem in a device is to define the susceptible circuit, the interference transmission path(s) and the source. Once having identified these parameters, it is necessary to reduce the RF energy arriving at the susceptible device. One method for reducing interference is to provide filtering on the device power line. A normal power line filter is built as a classical low pass filter, that is, series inductors and shunt capacitors either in L, T or pi configuration. For adequate insertion loss these filters must have either 20 - 600 microhenries inductance or. 01 to 2 microfarads or more capacitance. Due to safety reasons in commercial equipment, Underwriters Laboratory (UL) limits the shunt capacitance from each power line <b>to</b> <b>chassis</b> <b>ground</b> to a value which allows less than 5 milliamperes of current to flow to the chassis under the most adverse conditions of frequency and voltage. This current limitation is even more stringent in some medical electronic applications. When the shunt capacitance is limited, the inductance in a filter must be increased to retain the same cutoff frequency (fc). However, the inductor will cause a voltage drop equal to IWL. When L is large and I is large due to machine power requirements, this voltage drop may be large enough to impair the function of the machine. In addition, the size of the inductor must be physically large to prevent the saturation of the core. This imposes problems of size and weight which can be objectionable. In some circumstances, a common mode filter can be used to attain the required insertion loss while minimizing size and weight requirements. The non-availability of design aids and the unpredictable behavior of the common-mode filter led to a detailed analysis of the common-mode filter. The common-mode filter circuits were analyzed using the Electronics Circuit Analysis Program...|$|E

50|$|Another {{commonly}} used shielding method, especially with electronic goods housed in plastic enclosures, is {{to coat the}} inside of the enclosure with a metallic ink or similar material. The ink consists of a carrier material loaded with a suitable metal, typically copper or nickel, in the form of very small particulates.
