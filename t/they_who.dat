5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and {{tugging at the}} carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is <b>they</b> <b>who</b> usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E

No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; <b>they</b> <b>who</b> were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is <b>they</b> <b>who</b> rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

25|$|A final {{review of}} the Scots Greys as a cavalry {{regiment}} occurred at Nablus in the Palestine mandate once the campaign in Syria and Lebanon was complete.

Now designated as an armoured regiment, they received their first tanks in September 1941. Initially, the Scots Greys trained on the Stuart tank.|$|E

25|$|As {{taught by}} Blavatsky, Theosophy holds {{that there is}} an ancient and secretive brotherhood of spiritual adepts known as the Masters, who — {{although}} found across the world — are centred in Tibet. These Masters are believed to have cultivated great wisdom and paranormal powers, and Theosophists believe that it was <b>they</b> <b>who</b> initiated the modern Theosophical movement through disseminating their teachings via Blavatsky. They believe that these Masters are attempting to revive knowledge of an ancient religion once found across the world and which will again come to eclipse the existing world religions.|$|E
25|$|The FIU Golden Panthers (now Panthers) {{won their}} last {{game at the}} Orange Bowl against the North Texas Mean Green on December 1, 2007 by a score of 38–19, {{snapping}} a 23-game losing streak that many attributed to the consequences of suspensions following the UM-FIU brawl the year before.

5|$|According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi {{considered}} untouchability to {{be wrong}} and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority.

25|$|The abbey {{site and}} {{surrounding}} land {{seem to have}} been rented to Thomas Forster of Evelith, Shifnal, and his wife, Elizabeth, and it was <b>they</b> <b>who</b> had to account to the Exchequer for the abbey temporalities around 1542. However, on 22 July 1546 the lands and site were sold to two property speculators, Edward Watson of Northampton and Henry Herdson, a London skinner. They had only a pecuniary interest in the abbey site and sold it the following day to William Langley, a Shrewsbury tailor. After five generations, the last of the Langley line left it in 1701 to Edward Baldwin, a Middle Temple lawyer. As he died without issue, it was passed via his sister to the Powys family.|$|E

25|$|The Germani tribes which Caesar {{had earlier}} named {{in this region}} were the Eburones, the Condrusi, the Paemani (or Caemani), the Caeroesi, and the Segni. The biggest and most {{important}} tribe were the Eburones, and it is <b>they</b> <b>who</b> appear to have dominated {{all or most of}} modern-day Belgian and Dutch Limburg, with a territory probably covering all or most of the flat Campine (Dutch Kempen) northern part of this region, and stretching into neighbouring regions of the Netherlands, Wallonia and Germany. The other tribes are thought to have lived further south, in what is today Wallonia, or else just over the border in Germany - the Condrusi in the modern Condroz, near the Segni, and the Caeroesi in the Eifel forest region of Germany.|$|E

They wear their hair long, and have every part of their body shaved except their head and upper lip. Ten and even twelve have wives common to them, and particularly brothers among brothers, and parents among their children; but if there be any issue by these wives, they are reputed to be the children of those by whom respectively each was first espoused when a virgin.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} {{theories}} {{for the arrival}} of Hinduism in Indonesia include that South Indian sea traders brought Hinduism with them, and second being that Indonesian royalty welcomed Indian religions and culture, and it is <b>they</b> <b>who</b> first adopted these spiritual ideas followed by the masses. Indonesian islands adopted both Hindu and Buddhist ideas, fusing them with pre-existing native folk religion and Animist beliefs. In the 4th century, the kingdom of Kutai in East Kalimantan, Tarumanagara in West Java, and Holing (Kalingga) in Central Java, were among the early Hindu states established in the region. Excavations between 1950 and 2005, particularly at the Cibuaya and Batujaya sites, suggests that Tarumanagara revered deity Wisnu (Vishnu) of Hinduism. Ancient Hindu kingdoms of Java built many square temples, named rivers on the island as Gomati and Ganges, and completed major irrigation and infrastructure projects.|$|E
