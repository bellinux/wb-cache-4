5|$|Writing in 1841 in {{the journal}} Kunstblatt, Passavant gave an account of how <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> were bought at auction from either a Spanish monastery or convent.

50|$|After moving <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to <b>the</b> proper {{deployment}} location {{as indicated}} on <b>the</b> <b>Panel</b> Layout Diagram for <b>the</b> project, <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> is unfolded or unrolled from the shipping pallet. The pallet is usually on a front-end loader or forklift which moves backwards to facilitate unfolding or unrolling of <b>the</b> <b>panel.</b> Pulling <b>the</b> geomembrane <b>panel</b> off <b>the</b> pallet or the roll by a chain {{is not recommended}} because it may damage the geomembrane. Deployment personnel are then positioned approximately 4.6 m apart {{along the edges of}} <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to unfold and move <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> into <b>the</b> proper location. If the edge to be gripped is to be subsequently welded or bonded, <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> edge is folded back about 0.6 to 1.0 m, creating a fold. The fold is gripped using the 0.3 m long by 10 mm (1-foot long by 2 inch) diameter smooth wooden dowel or a smooth grade stake rather than the edge itself. This is to avoid stretching <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> edge where it is to be bonded to another <b>panel.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> is pulled out, it is necessary to maintain air under the geomembrane to reduce friction with the ground surface. This can be accomplished by holding <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> edge and advancing at a rate fast enough to create air under the geomembrane as it is unfolded. Another method is to “fan” air under the geomembrane by raising and lowering the edge of <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> to create a wave-like action across the liner as it is being spread. After <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> is set in the exact position, it is welded or bonded to adjacent panels.|$|R

5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. <b>The</b> <b>panels</b> reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and well known to the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. <b>The</b> <b>panels</b> and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. <b>The</b> <b>panels</b> themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet to the rear of <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{mention of}} the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost triptych. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert because key areas formally resembled pages of the Turin-Milan Hours, which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand. On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted <b>the</b> <b>panels</b> around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.|$|E

40|$|Initial {{stage of}} {{incompressible}} liquid impact onto a corrugated elastic panel with account for compressible gas trapping between the corrugations is studied. The liquid free surface is flat and parallel to <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> before impact. <b>The</b> impact velocity is constant in this study. The corrugations are modelled as identical rigid short structures {{on the surface}} of <b>the</b> flat <b>panel.</b> <b>The</b> <b>panel</b> is either of infinite or finite length. There are only two corrugations which are placed symmetrically on <b>the</b> <b>panel.</b> Only a part of <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> between these two corrugations is elastic. The liquid free surface closes the gas cavity between the two corrugations at the initial instant of impact and compresses the gas before the fluid comes in contact with the elastic part of <b>the</b> <b>panel.</b> <b>The</b> elastic deflections of <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> are caused by gas pressure in the cavity. The elastic deflections modify both the pressure in the cavity and the hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the wetted part of <b>the</b> <b>panel.</b> <b>The</b> hydroelastic problem is solved within the Wagner approach. The effect of gas compressibility on the elastic behaviour of <b>the</b> corrugated elastic <b>panel</b> is investigated. It is shown that the pressure in the gas cavity and elastic deflections grow beyond all bounds for <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> of infinite length and are finite if <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> is of finite length.
