5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} in the {{mountains}} of Kurdistan. He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought <b>the</b> <b>curiosity</b> of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E

5|$|The Eshmun Temple was {{improved}} {{during the}} early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced paganism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred <b>the</b> <b>curiosity</b> of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 {{until the beginning of}} the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list.|$|E

Stewie tries to help Brian by staying by his side {{and taking care of}} him, but Brian continues to perceive himself in an ugly world where he is continually attacked by various monsters resembling the Griffins and Quagmire. Brian eventually snaps out of the hallucination after Stewie helps him downstairs to drink some water.|$|E
5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. <b>The</b> <b>curiosity</b> of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in the field, and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel Balāṭa.|$|E

5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard <b>the</b> <b>Curiosity</b> rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from <b>the</b> <b>Curiosity</b> rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and develop a reliable and valid instrumentation for measuring both the trait and state curiosity of junior high school students.
