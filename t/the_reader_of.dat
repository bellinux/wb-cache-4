5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|Recently, postmodernism {{has come}} to convey more {{completely}} prose and poetry as distinct entities, and also among genres of poetry, as having meaning only as cultural artifacts. Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> a text (Hermeneutics), and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read. Today, throughout the world, poetry often incorporates poetic form and diction from other cultures and from the past, further confounding attempts at definition and classification that were once sensible within a tradition such as the Western canon.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E

25|$|The {{contemporaneous}} musical {{fashion of}} the outer world has ever found its echo {{within the walls of}} the synagogue, so that in the superstructure added by successive generations of transmitting singers there are always discernible points of comparison, even of contact, with the style and structure of each successive era in the musical history of other religious communions. Attention has frequently been drawn to the resemblances in manner and even in some points of detail between the chants of the muezzin and of <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> the Qur'an with much of the hazzanut, not alone of the Sephardim, who passed so many centuries in Arab lands, but also of the Ashkenazim, equally long located far away in northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Qualitative {{research}} is sometimes {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of qualitative research can be applied to other settings—as long as <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell us more about the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the students need to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E

25|$|Octopus card fares are {{calculated}} {{based on the}} minimum number of stops travelled (from origin to destination stops), rather {{than the number of}} fare zones travelled through. All stops have Octopus entry and exit processors at the entrances to and exits from platforms. Passengers may enter the system after placing their Octopus on <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>of</b> an orange-coloured 'Entry Processor' reader. This action is known as validation. At this point, The maximum fare is deducted from the Octopus. On completion of a journey, the card previously read by an 'Entry Processor' must be placed on a dark-green coloured 'Exit Processor', where the maximum fare less the fare incurred is refunded. Failure to do so within the time limit would cause the fare difference to be forfeited. As a side note, if a person exits the same platform with the same Octopus card with 5 minutes, the fare deducted will be fully refunded.|$|E
