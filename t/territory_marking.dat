5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, <b>territory</b> <b>marking</b> (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E

50|$|Tsessebe {{are social}} animals. Females form herds {{composed}} {{of six to}} 10, with their young. After males turn one year of age, they are ejected from the herd and form bachelor herds that can be as large as 30 young bulls. Territorial adult bulls form herds {{the same size as}} young bulls, although the formation of adult bull herds is mainly seen in the formation of a lek. Tsessebe declare their territory through a variety of behaviors. Territorial behavior includes moving in erect posture, high-stepping, defecating in a crouch stance, ground-horning, mudpacking, shoulder-wiping, and grunting. The most important aggressive display of territorial dominance is in the horning of the ground. Another far more curious form of <b>territory</b> <b>marking</b> is through the anointing of their foreheads and horns with secretions from glands near their eyes. Tsessebe accomplish this by inserting grass stems into their preorbital glands to coat them with secretion, then waving it around, letting the secretions fall onto their heads and horns. This process is not as commonly seen as ground-horning, nor is its purpose as well known.|$|E
5000|$|Some time {{is spent}} {{grooming}} the fur {{of the head and}} face with the forepaws and scratching the head and front part of the body with the hind feet. Apart from settling the fur and removing external parasites, these activities may serve to spread the secretions of the apocrine glands onto the paws for <b>territory</b> <b>marking.</b> Much {{time is spent}} loitering in specially selected spots, usually on a prominent rock or tree stump within a few metres (yards) of a hole, for up to ten minutes at a time. On some of these occasions, the pika seems to be sunbathing in a relaxed stance, the animal often turning its head towards the sun, but at other times the animal seems alert and on the look out. The approach of a predator or an observer too closely for comfort causes the animal to scurry away into its hole with a sharp warning cry [...] "Kitz". At certain times, an animal may call from an eminence to other pikas in the area and other individuals may respond. Other shrill calls may be made when sitting or moving around but their significance is unclear.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the Dufour’s gland is to secrete chemicals, but {{the nature of the}} {{secretions}} and their function differs in various hymenopteran groups. The secretion is often used in communication to mark members of the colony, to mark hosts (parasitic wasps), during slave raids (ants), for <b>territory</b> <b>marking</b> (ants), to signal fertility, to attract a member of the opposite sex, to give an alarm warning (ants) or to mark a trail (ants). This use of scent marking pheromones secreted by Dufour's gland is observed in the carpenter bee Xylocopa pubescens to mark flowers and nests. Other functions include lubricating the valves of the ovipositor during egg-laying, serving as a component of material used to build the nest, serving as a food for the developing larvae and being mixed with pollen and nectar to provision the brood cell before egg-laying. For instance, the well developed Dufour's gland {{is one of the main}} physical characteristics of a social wasp Parischnogaster mellyi, and the abundant abdominal secretion from the gland has been found to play an important role in egg development and oviposition. The gland is well-developed in various solitary mining bees where it is used to waterproof and make fungus-resistant the lining of the brood cells.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{retelling of}} Adam and Eve's story (as {{found in the}} first three {{chapters}} of the Book of Genesis) from Dog's point of view. Dog is shown in the Garden of Eden, exploring its environment and encountering various animals. Its doggy nature is revealed in various scenes from <b>territory</b> <b>marking</b> to barking at a passing mastodon to attempting to befriend a lemur. One day in the savanna, it encounters the newly created Adam who is also exploring Eden. Adam feeds Dog some grains, pets it and moves on. The next day, Adam is high up on a tree, interacting with a bird, when Dog sees him again. Adam tosses down a fruit to Dog and climbs down. He is surprised that Dog is fascinated by the branch (now stripped of fruit) he is holding. When he throws the branch away, Dog fetches it back. Dog is excited when Adam (who knows all animal languages) barks like it. They become friends and explore Eden together. One day, Dog sees Adam with a new creature, Eve with long red hair. Dog attempts to interest Adam in a game of fetch but Adam throws the stick extremely far away in order to get rid of Dog. When Dog returns with the stick, Adam and Eve are gone. Dog waits all day for him to return. At night, Dog (with stick) wanders Eden and sees a panther with a dead rabbit in its mouth. It starts to rain. Dog then sees Adam and Eve, wearing clothes, running through the forest. He chases after them, barking joyously but when Adam turns around, his face is so distorted and sinister, Dog runs away terrified. Other animals also flee them. Adam and Eve stop and stand facing away from each other. They look ashamed, dejected and alone. The next day, Adam and Eve emerge from Eden and enters a bleak desert. They are clothed in rough animal fur. Dog sees them leave, takes a step out of Eden, pauses and then returns to Eden. It then dashes out with the stick in its mouth and runs towards them. In the last scene, Dog lays the stick at a surprised Adam's feet. Adam kneels down and pets Dog and tells Eve who Dog is. Eve kneels down in front of Dog and hugs and kisses it. Adam and Eve walk off together. They are holding hands and so close they seem like one person. Dog walks right by their side.|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{communication}} is intensely used by deer, especially scent-marking behaviors, with <b>territory</b> <b>marking</b> mainly made by males. This work presents several video recordings {{of at least}} two gray brockets (male and female) chemically communicating via scent marks. Video recordings demonstrate multiple depositions of feces and urine by the animals, probably for the development of intrasexual interaction and, secondarily, territorial marks. The chemical communication observed is possibly related to reproduction or intraspecific competition for resources. These territorial marks are particularly important for avoiding intraspecific competition for resources and sexual partners...|$|E
40|$|Aromatase-expressing neuroendocrine neurons in the {{vertebrate}} male brain synthesize estradiol from circulating testosterone. This locally produced estradiol controls neural circuits underlying courtship vocalization, mating, aggression, and <b>territory</b> <b>marking</b> in male mice. How aromatase-expressing neuronal populations control these diverse estrogen-dependent male behaviors {{is poorly}} understood, and the function, if any, of aromatase-expressing neurons in females is unclear. Using targeted genetic approaches, {{we show that}} aromatase-expressing neurons within the male posterodorsal medial amygdala (MeApd) regulate components of aggression, but not other estrogen-dependent male-typical behaviors. Remarkably, aromatase-expressing MeApd neurons in females are specifically required for components of maternal aggression, which we show is distinct from intermale aggression in pattern and execution. Thus, aromatase-expressing MeApd neurons control distinct forms of aggression in the two sexes.  Moreover, our findings indicate that complex social behaviors are separable in a modular manner at the level of genetically identified neuronal populations...|$|E
