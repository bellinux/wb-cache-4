40|$|SummaryPrimary T cell {{activation}} {{involves the}} integration of three distinct signals delivered in sequence: (1) antigen recognition, (2) costimulation, and (3) cytokine-mediated differentiation and expansion. Strong immunostimulatory events such as immunotherapy or infection induce profound cytokine release causing “bystander” T cell activation, thereby increasing the potential for autoreactivity and need for control. We show that during strong stimulation, a profound suppression of primary CD 4 + T-cell-mediated immune responses ensued and was observed across preclinical models and patients undergoing high-dose interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) therapy. This suppression targeted naive CD 4 + but not CD 8 + T cells and was mediated through <b>transient</b> <b>suppressor</b> of cytokine signaling- 3 (SOCS 3) inhibition of the STAT 5 b transcription factor signaling pathway. These events resulted in complete paralysis of primary CD 4 + T cell activation, affecting memory generation and induction of autoimmunity as well as impaired viral clearance.

40|$|An {{on-going}} {{question in}} the field of surge protection study is how to predict incipient failure of power electronics {{in the event of a}} short time, high voltage, and high energy transient surge propagation. The work presented in this thesis addresses the above question by investigating how a high voltage transient surge, whose duration is in the microseconds range, will propagate through the two-level <b>transient</b> voltage <b>suppressor</b> system that is intended to protect sophisticated electronics situated close to the service entrance of a building. In this work the energy patterns relevant to the individual components of the system are evaluated using numerical methods and some of the results are also compared with those obtained using SPICE simulations. Although several mathematical models for surge protection components are discussed in the literature and some device specific ones are provided by manufacturers, there is no evidence to show that a complete analysis, using any such model, has been performed to predict the energy absorptions and associated time lags between the components in a TVSS. Numerical simulation techniques using MATLAB are used to estimate the energy absorption and associated time delays in relation to the propagated transient surge, in individual components of a <b>transient</b> voltage surge <b>suppressor.</b> This study develops mathematical models for particular nonlinear transient surge absorbing elements, specifically for the metal oxide varistor and <b>transient</b> voltage <b>suppressor</b> diode, formulates the state equations which are used to numerically simulate several instances of the <b>transient</b> voltage surge <b>suppressor</b> system, and presents simulation results. All results are validated experimentally using a lightning surge simulator.
