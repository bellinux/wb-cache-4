5|$|Early wagons {{were built}} on four wheeled under frames, but from 1871 bogie {{vehicles}} begun to appear. These early wagons were of all wood construction, but later types had wooden bodies on steel underframes, then followed by all steel wagons. Groups of wagons {{of the same}} design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code, initially in a system restricted to Victoria only, but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced. Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon, the second represents the general <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> the third separates different classes of the same general type, and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the Roman term basterna, denoting a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> or litter, is derived from the name of this people (or, if it is an exonym, the name of the people is derived from it) which was known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon-train for their families.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: One {{of the two}} 'Wren' class {{narrow gauge}} steam {{locomotives}} of Camber Railway on the Falkland Islands, 1915. The open cab was not appropriate for a Falklands winter. This photo was probably taken immediately after the unloading of the locomotive in 1915, with the ship in the background being the SS Ismailia which brought the railway and wireless station equipment out from Britain. The picture illustrates the two original <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> a tipper on an inside bearing oval chassis seen on the left, and a flat wagon on a rectangular outside bearing chassis seen to the right. Both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> ran on coil springs.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are also}} many other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> such as [...] "low loader" [...] wagons or well wagons for {{transporting}} road vehicles. There are refrigerator cars for transporting {{foods such as}} ice cream. There are simple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> open-topped <b>wagons</b> for transporting minerals and bulk material such as coal, and tankers for transporting liquids and gases. Today, however, most coal and aggregates are moved in hopper wagons that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, George Talbot {{developed}} a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> - the self discharging wagon, which became {{a major source of}} sales. A modern plant along North American lines was added in Jülicher Straße in the 1890s, with modern equipment including air hammers, rivetting machines, and electric power for machines. By 1900, the plant employed up to 400 workers.|$|E
50|$|Typical loads {{for these}} wagons {{are all sorts}} of bulk goods, like coal, coke, ore, sand or gravel. Because bulk goods are often moved in large quantities, these wagons are {{frequently}} used in so-called unit or block trains that only comprise one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> and only shift one type of product from the dispatcher to the recipient.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} role {{of these}} vehicles was {{the transport of}} new, mostly open-topped cars. But {{by the end of}} the 20th century there was no longer any significant demand for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon.</b> However, one remaining sphere of work is, for example, the transportation of the elephants for Circus Knie in special Hcks wagons belonging to the Swiss Federal Railways.|$|E
50|$|British Railways used several {{standard}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon.</b> The Conflat A, {{which could}} carry one type 'B', or two type 'A', containers, {{was the most}} common; while the Conflat L, which could carry three smaller containers for bulk powders, was also produced in large numbers.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to these tenets, La Roumanie provided details {{on the history of}} Bucharest during the 1830s, including the number and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> and carriages (70 hansom cabs, 1,775 phaetons and 7,502 <b>wagons),</b> and that <b>of</b> inns and hotels (he calculated that there were 20 of each).|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between the ordinary and special <b>types</b> <b>of</b> flat <b>wagon</b> is that the former always {{have to have a}} flat deck that can be driven on, whereas the special types {{do not have to be}} so designed. Within both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> flat <b>wagon,</b> there are variants with separate axles as well as bogie wagons.|$|R
5000|$|As DWV vans they {{railway wagon}} {{association}} they bore the class letters [...] "GM" [...] or [...] "NZ". Due {{to the high}} number of A2s, the Deutsche Reichsbahn had to create two or this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> two [...] "district classes" [...] (Gattungsbezirke) for them: [...] "Kassel" [...] and [...] "München" [...] ("Munich") as well as the category letter [...] "G".|$|E
50|$|The swing-roof and rolling-roof wagons with level floors {{feature a}} high loading limit {{of at least}} 50 t and are {{therefore}} often used in heavy industry. In addition, they are good for hygroscopic bulk commodities which have to be loaded from above. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> shares its sphere of operations with flat wagons with tarpaulins or hoods in classes K, R and S.|$|E
5000|$|A new wagon {{numbering}} system was adopted in Indian Railways in 2003. Wagons are allocated 11 digit numbers [...] {{making it easy}} for identification and computerization of the wagon information. The first two digits indicate <b>Type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wagon.</b> Next two digits indicate Owning Railway. Next two digits indicate Year of Manufacture. Next four digits indicate Individual Wagon Number and the last digit is a Check digit.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> freight trains, which are used to carry {{many different kinds of}} freight, with many different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> One <b>of</b> the most common types on modern railways are container trains, where containers can be lifted on and off the train by cranes and loaded off or onto trucks or ships.|$|R
50|$|Wagons {{have served}} {{numerous}} purposes, with numerous corresponding designs. As with motorized vehicles, some {{are designed to}} serve as many functions as possible, while others are highly specialized. This section will discuss a broad overview of the general classes of wagons; for details on specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons,</b> see the individual links.|$|R

50|$|Falconry {{has been}} a hunting sport since 2000 BC {{originating}} in ancient China and Egypt and since then the technique of hacking has been used and evolved. The term “hacking,” however, was not coined until the Elizabethan era. During that period, falconers brought a “hack,” an old English word for a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> to a hilltop and placed young falcons upon it when they still {{did not know how}} to fly yet.|$|E
50|$|With {{very few}} exceptions, all GWR wagons were {{allocated}} a page in a diagram book that showed its major dimensions and characteristics. Each page had an alpha-numeric identification; the letters gave the general <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> while the numbers identified more detailed {{characteristics of the}} wagons. For example, O8 was a 25 ft open wagon, but V8 was a 28.5 ft banana van while V7 was a 21 ft ventilated goods van.|$|E
50|$|The Susquehannock {{population}} had been devastated by high fatalities from new Eurasian infectious diseases, {{to which they}} had no immunity, followed by warfare. About 1697, a few hundred surviving Susquehannock settled in a new village in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania called Conestoga Town. The river was named for them as the Conestoga River under Governor William Penn. A <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> was named for them that was later used by pioneers migrating west. Hardware kits for them were made {{on the east side}} of the Alleghenies.|$|E

50|$|The VT 98.9 {{evolved from}} the VT 95.9 which, with its single motor, was too underpowered for many lines. The VT 98.9 was {{therefore}} fitted with two driving motors. Because this variant of the railbus was fitted with normal buffers and screw couplings, it could haul other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> or be placed {{at the end of}} other trains hauled by other locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the broad}} gauge, VR's [...] narrow-gauge network never had four-wheeled wagons (aside from {{a handful of}} trolleys). Because of this, a single design of open wagon emerged and this was the only <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> ever used on these lines. This was the NQR class, a wagon with the same length and loading {{capacity}} as a broad-gauge four-wheeled open wagon to make transferring freight between the gauges easier. The wagons, numbered 1 through 218, were built between 1898 and 1914. The wagons used the same underframe as most other non-locomotives on the VR narrow-gauge lines.|$|E
50|$|A tub or quarry tub {{is a type}} of railway or tramway wagon used in {{quarries}} {{and other}} industrial locations for the transport of minerals (such as coal, sand, ore, clay and stone) from a quarry or mine face to processing plants or between various parts of an industrial site. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon</b> may be small enough for one person to push, or designed for haulage by a horse, or for connection in a train hauled by a locomotive. The tubs are designed for ease of emptying, usually by a side-tipping action. This type of rail vehicle is now mainly obsolete, its function having been mostly replaced by conveyor belts.|$|E
50|$|The {{early period}} from 1867 to 1892. Capital letters {{were used to}} {{indicate}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagon,</b> e.g. G = open wagon with low sides, short; H= log wagon. Photographs suggest that this system took time to develop and was not fully established until after the Bavarian Ostbahn had been merged into the State Railway in 1877. Roman or Arabic numerals were used additionally to indicate {{the age of the}} wagon, e.g. an A I was an old, 6-wheeled, goods van for a load of 12 t , whilst an A³ was a 10 m long 'modern' van for 15 t load (10 t was 'normal') and an H2 was a log wagon built between 1860 and 1880. The owner inscription was K.Bay.Sts.B. with a rather square, crowned Bavarian coat of arms (white and blue lozenges).|$|E
2500|$|The Talyllyn Railway was {{primarily}} constructed for conveying slate.
