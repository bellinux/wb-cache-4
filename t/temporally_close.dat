50|$|Coincidence {{detection}} in {{the context}} of neurobiology is a process by which a neuron or a neural circuit can encode information by detecting the occurrence of <b>temporally</b> <b>close</b> but spatially distributed input signals. Coincidence detectors influence neuronal information processing by reducing temporal jitter, reducing spontaneous activity, and forming associations between separate neural events. This concept has led to a greater understanding of neural processes and the formation of computational maps in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Coincidence {{detection}} {{relies on}} separate inputs converging {{on a common}} target. Consider a basic neural circuit with two input neurons, A and B, that have excitatory synaptic terminals converging on a single output neuron, C (Fig. 1). If each input neuron's EPSP is subthreshold for an action potential at C, then C will not fire unless the two inputs from A and B are <b>temporally</b> <b>close</b> together. Synchronous arrival of these two inputs may push the membrane potential of a target neuron over the threshold required to create an action potential. If the two inputs arrive too far apart, the depolarization of the first input may have time to drop significantly, preventing the membrane potential of the target neuron from reaching the action potential threshold. This example incorporates the principles of spatial and temporal summation. Furthermore, coincidence detection can reduce the jitter formed by spontaneous activity. While random sub-threshold stimulations by neuronal cells may not often fire coincidentally, coincident synaptic inputs derived from a unitary external stimulus will ensure that a target neuron fires {{as a result of}} the stimulus.|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of online detection, a {{structural}} property of a message is the timestamp. Other properties are content-based and must be recognized as specialized types: a Trusted Message, i.e., a message which is not sent for malicious, disruptive or abusive purposes (Mendoza et al. 2010; Castillo et al. 2011); a Primary Message, i.e., a message sent by a user who is actually present at the referred event and can directly describe it (Kumar et al. 2013; Morstatter et al. 2014); an Emergency Message, i.e., a message reporting an actual social emergency and not, for instance, reporting a personal problem via an idiom made of emergency words (Avvenuti et al. 2014 a). If all these properties are available in a single message, that message can be considered an instance of a further specialized concept, the Ongoing Emergency Message, which is a message reporting an ongoing emergency. In addition, an Ongoing Emergency Message must have another property: being <b>temporally</b> <b>close</b> to another message of the same typology. This way, the Social Detection System recognizes a number of <b>temporally</b> <b>close</b> messages. Thus, the detection of an actual social emergency encompasses many messages, differently arranged in time {{depending on the type}} of emergency.|$|E

40|$|As time {{distances}} {{people from}} moral transgressions, do affected parties experience a lingering need {{for addressing the}} past, or does the need gradually fade away over time? Do people perceive time differently {{depending on whether the}} ingroup has committed or suffered the transgression? In two different intergroup contexts, we investigate the role of temporal distance in attitudes toward justice and reconciliation after moral transgressions from the perspectives of both victim and perpetrator groups. In the context of the conflict between Serbs and Bosniaks, Study 1 showed that temporal distance from intergroup transgressions predicted different reactions to the transgression between victim and perpetrator groups. Whereas increased subjective temporal distance predicted more opposition to justice and reconciliation efforts via reduced empathy for outgroup members among the perpetrator group, it predicted more willingness to forgo justice and reconcile via increased empathy for outgroup members among the victim group. Study 1 also demonstrated another type of temporal asymmetry between victim and perpetrator groups. Compared to Serbs, the primary perpetrator group in the conflict, Bosniaks perceived the war as <b>temporally</b> <b>closer.</b> In the context of the conflict between the U. S. and Iran, Study 2 provided a partial conceptual replication of Study 1, and further explored the moderating role of ingroup glorification. Whereas high glorifiers perceived the transgression as <b>temporally</b> <b>closer</b> when the ingroup is the victim than the perpetrator, low glorifiers reacted in the exact opposite manner, perceiving the transgression as more distant when the ingroup was the perpetrator than when it was the victim. These divergent perceptions of time further yielded victim and perpetrator group members’ different attitudes toward justice and reconciliation. Study 3 further established the causal relationships between temporal distance and attitudes toward justice and reconciliation via empathy, again moderated by glorification.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that in tasks {{requiring}} participants to report the direction of apparent motion, task-irrelevant mono-beeps can "capture" visual motion perception when the beeps occur <b>temporally</b> <b>close</b> to the visual stimuli. However, the contributions of the relative timing of multimodal events and the event structure, modulating uni- and/or crossmodal perceptual grouping, remain unclear. To examine this question and extend the investigation to the tactile modality, the current experiments presented tactile two-tap apparent-motion streams, with an SOA of 400 ms between successive, left-/right-hand middle-finger taps, accompanied by task-irrelevant, non-spatial auditory stimuli. The streams were shown for 90 seconds, and participants' task was to continuously report the perceived (left- or rightward) direction of tactile motion. In Experiment 1, each tactile stimulus was paired with an auditory beep, though odd-numbered taps were paired with an asynchronous beep, with audiotactile SOAs ranging from - 75 ms to 75 ms. Perceived direction of tactile motion varied systematically with audiotactile SOA, indicative of a temporal-capture effect. In Experiment 2, two audiotactile SOAs [...] one short (75 ms), one long (325 ms) [...] were compared. The long-SOA condition preserved the crossmodal event structure (so the temporal-capture dynamics should have been similar to that in Experiment 1), but both beeps now occurred <b>temporally</b> <b>close</b> to the taps on one side (even-numbered taps). The two SOAs were found to produce opposite modulations of apparent motion, indicative of an influence of crossmodal grouping. In Experiment 3, only odd-numbered, but not even-numbered, taps were paired with auditory beeps. This abolished the temporal-capture effect and, instead, a dominant percept of apparent motion from the audiotactile side to the tactile-only side was observed independently of the SOA variation. These findings suggest that asymmetric crossmodal grouping leads to an attentional modulation of apparent motion, which inhibits crossmodal temporal-capture effects. ...|$|E

As with any other field in Systems Biology, computational tools are required {{to deal with this}} ocean of data. iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute quantification) is a technique that allows simultaneous quantification of proteins from multiple samples. Although iTRAQ data gives useful insights to the biologist, it is more complex to perform analysis and draw biological conclusions because of its multi-plexed design. One such problem is to find proteins that behave in a similar way (i. e. change in abundance) among various time points since the temporal variations in the proteomics data reveal important biological information. Distance based methods such as Euclidian distance or Pearson coefficient, and clustering techniques such as k-mean etc, are not able {{to take into account the}} temporal information of the series. In this paper, we present an linear-time algorithm for clustering similar patterns among various iTRAQ time course data irrespective of their absolute values. The algorithm, referred to as Temporal Pattern Mining(TPM), maps the data from a Cartesian plane to a discrete binary plane. After the mapping a dynamic programming technique allows mining of similar data elements that are <b>temporally</b> <b>closer</b> to each other. The proposed algorithm accurately clusters iTRAQ data that are <b>temporally</b> <b>closer</b> to each other with more than 99 % accuracy. Experimental results for different problem sizes are analyzed in terms of quality of clusters, execution time and scalability for large data sets.

To examine the impact of image availability and the influence of temporal distance on the selection of input training data (i. e. time separating the training data from the gap-filled target image), input images acquired within the same season (<b>temporally</b> <b>close)</b> as well as in different seasons (temporally far) to the target image were examined, as was the case of using information only within the target image itself. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean spectral angle (MSA), and coefficient of determination (R- 2) were used as the evaluation metrics to assess the prediction results. In addition, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (kappa) were used to assess a land-cover classification based on the gap-filled images.
