Industrial structure is determined and evolved by the law of historical development and resources endowment, <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> opening {{can play an important}} role in regional industry optimization evolution because of its unique characteristics in the production elements and the product transfer. <b>Traffic</b> <b>Rights</b> Opening and Its Economic Implications <b>Traffic</b> <b>rights</b> refer to the rights of the international air transport. It first appeared in the 1944 Chicago International Conference on Civil Aviation and formed eight kinds of <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> so commonly used from the earliest five basic traffic rights[1]. Judging from the history of the development and usage of the <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> it is a tool to protect the national aviation interests and national interests[2]. <b>Traffic</b> <b>rights</b> opening refers to a country open up its own <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> to the foreign airlines. The <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> is opened to specific city by governments, therefore, in a sense it’s the monopoly resources of the city, its utilization degree can influence the city’s international competitiveness[3].

50|$|Fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> are {{sought by}} {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the second freedom. Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> while sixth freedom traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|R

5000|$|The fifth freedom allows {{an airline}} to carry revenue traffic between foreign {{countries}} {{as a part}} of services connecting the airline's own country. [...] It is the right to carry passengers from one's own country to a second country, and from that country to a third country (and so on). An example of a fifth freedom <b>traffic</b> <b>right</b> is an Emirates flight in 2004 from Dubai to Brisbane, Australia and onward to Auckland, New Zealand, where tickets can be sold on any sector. Fifth freedom traffic rights are intended to enhance the economic viability of an airline's long haul routes, but tend to be viewed by local airlines and governments as potentially unfair competition. The negotiations for fifth freedom traffic rights can be lengthy, because in practice the approval of at least three different nations is required.|$|E

5000|$|According to the NJDOT, a jughandle is an [...] "at-grade ramp" [...] {{provided}} at or between intersections to permit motorists to make indirect left turns and/or U-turns. This design utilizes a setup {{that requires a}} motorist to use a ramp off the right lane of the main road {{in advance of the}} intersection or beyond the intersection. The NJDOT defines three types of jughandles in its design manual. [...] "Type A" [...] is the standard forward jughandle that intersects with a cross street. With forward ramps, all turning <b>traffic</b> (<b>right</b> and left) exit onto a jughandle ramp to the right. [...] "Type B" [...] is a variant with no cross-street intersected by the jughandle; it curves 90 degrees left to meet the main street, and is only used at a [...] "T" [...] intersection or a U-turn. [...] "Type C" [...] is the standard reverse jughandle; left-turning vehicles pass through the intersection and enter a ramp that loops roughly 270 degrees. Jughandles can cause motorist confusion because turning setups are inconsistent among intersections, and such an alignment is unfamiliar to motorists outside of the northeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{there is}} little {{activity}} on the Belt Line north of the Columbus Blvd. ports on the Delaware River near Southwark; however, projects are being proposed and considered that will, if put through and take action on, significantly increase the line's rail traffic, especially freight traffic. The first and most probable project is a deal being worked with Kinder Morgan to transport 100-car tanker car trains full of liquified natural gas (LNG) from western Pennsylvania to tanker ships at Tioga Marine Terminal in northern Philadelphia, which would then take the LNG down the Delaware River to ports worldwide. The next most probable project, and possibly even more significant for the line's business, is the proposed Southport {{in what is now}} the abandoned northern portion of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Slated to begin construction soon and be completed within a few years, it will import and export immense container <b>traffic,</b> <b>right</b> next to CSX's South Philly Yard, which is located on the Belt Line. The third and least probable project is a passenger service to a proposed casino in south Philadelphia. The tram/light rail/train would run down the middle of Delaware Ave./Columbus Blvd. along the Delaware River waterfront, including a part which has been paved over from Spring Garden St. to around Allegheny Ave., where CSX's, Norfolk Southern's and Conrail's Port Richmond Yard is. Despite it being paved over, the trackage on N. Delaware Ave.'s right-of-way still exists there.|$|E

One major part of the thesis generally analyses different means of distributing limited public right, in order to determine an appropriate method for the allocation of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights.</b> After a comparison with the telecommunication sector, it is concluded that the most appropriate approach is to conduct a Beauty Contest in the form of a Documentary Hearing. It is suggested that airlines submit their proposals and the regulatory agencies make their choice based on certain criteria. Subsequently, a glance is taken at the methods for allocating air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> that are currently applied in several countries. It can be seen that all these countries have chosen the same approach, a Beauty Contest, and that they all are facing the same difficulties, which are inconsistency and ambiguity of the distribution procedure. Furthermore, a short evaluation, whether the General Agreement on Trade in Services has an impact on the allocation of air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights,</b> is undertaken. However, this is denied. Based on the previous results an own proposal is presented, how air <b>traffic</b> <b>rights</b> could be distributed in a Beauty Contest, while avoiding most of the difficulties encountered by other countries.

40|$|Pedestrians {{form the}} largest single road user group and also are the most {{vulnerable}} road users. Pedestrian’s movements are not restricted to lanes or specific routes however they are restricted by the physical boundaries around them such {{as the presence of}} walkways or pedestrian ways. The main objective {{of this study is to}} identify the various factors affecting pedestrian level of service (PLOS) at signalized intersections and to propose a suitable methodology for estimation of pedestrian level of service. The study carried out to develop a model for pedestrian level of service of signalized intersections in Vijayawada city and Bhubaneswar city based on pedestrian’s perception on safety and comfort. The main factors considered for the development of the model were through traffic, left turning <b>traffic,</b> <b>right</b> turning traffic, number of pedestrians, number of lanes and pedestrian delay. Pedestrian delay was one of the key performance indicators for pedestrian level of service. Total twelve crosswalks from two cities were considered for study purpose. Video graphic method was used for collection of field data. Questionnaire survey was conducted to know the perceived level of service of pedestrians. The various factors required to develop the model extracted from video graphic data. Pearson correlation analysis was done to identify the various significant factors influencing pedestrian level of service. By considering perceived LOS as dependent variable and significant factors as independent variables stepwise regression analysis was done to develop a model which suitable for urban Indian conditions. The study revealed that various factors affecting level of service under heterogeneous traffic condition were turning traffic, through traffic, number of lanes, and number of pedestrian and pedestrian delay...|$|E
