5|$|Rebmann {{stayed in}} Africa for almost thirty {{consecutive}} years. He {{kept to a}} policy that, in order to truly affect the African people, and to complete his task as a missionary, much patience was needed.

5|$|Cho was {{dispatched}} by the Soviet {{authorities to}} liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> of North Korean literature and arts.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the success}} of the Olympic {{football}} tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force,</b> again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament.|$|E
5|$|Except for the Munich area, {{the unit}} {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} any momentum. The membership of the SS declined from 1000 to 280 as the SS continued to struggle under the SA. As Heiden attempted to keep the small group from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler had a great enthusiasm and vision for the SS and displayed good organisational abilities which Heiden used. Himmler became <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> within the SS and in time eclipsed Heiden.|$|E
5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> of Lightning's single-minded determination.

A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|The ARoS Art Museum, the Old Town Museum and Tivoli Friheden {{are among}} Denmark's top tourist attractions. With a {{combined}} total of almost 1.4million visitors they represent <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind tourism but other venues such as Moesgård Museum and Kvindemuseet are also popular. The city's extensive shopping facilities are also {{said to be}} a major attraction for tourists, as are festivals, especially NorthSide and SPOT. Many visitors arrive on cruise ships: in 2012, 18 vessels visited the port with over 38,000 passengers.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) became <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> {{behind the}} Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} study of dinosaurs began in the 1820s of England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur, which under his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage {{in the perception of}} dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Mason got a job with the {{district}} bank while he attended night school in his spare time.

The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the Ryecroft area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.|$|E

5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force,</b> but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} {{differ in their}} views of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind these scientific achievements.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 Swillington, to the {{south-east}} of Leeds, {{was still}} a rural community, although mining was starting to assert itself as <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> of the local economy. Woodford was still the Provincial Grand Chaplain in Durham, while completing structural work on his church in Yorkshire. It was not until 1854 that he joined Philanthropic Lodge No 382 (now 304). The next year he was appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for West Yorkshire. He was master of Philanthropic in 1856 and 1858, and the lodge history asserts that it thrived {{during the years of}} his regular attendance. He re-wrote their ritual in a unique form, which was shared with five daughter and granddaughter lodges.|$|E

5|$|In March 1801, Frederick Accum {{was offered}} a {{position}} at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford. Accepting the position, he began as laboratory assistant to Humphry Davy, who had been hired {{at the same time}} as director of the laboratory, and would later become the president of the Royal Society. Accum’s employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803. His biographer, R. J. Cole, speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris. Rumford had been <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind securing a position for Accum.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise of London. It is unclear if the cathedral chapters of Bath and of Wells took the action on their own, or if King John was <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind the election.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah was seen as <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
