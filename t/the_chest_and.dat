5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E

Jean then talks to the devil, and the devil gives Jean three {{treasure}} <b>chests</b> <b>and</b> three princesses. Jean rings the bell, and he and his friends use the cord to lift <b>the</b> <b>chests</b> <b>and</b> princesses to <b>the</b> surface. When they get <b>the</b> <b>chests</b> <b>and</b> princesses to <b>the</b> top, Jean's friends run off with them and leave Jean {{at the bottom of the}} well.|$|R

5|$|Portable {{ventilators}} may {{be required}} to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until a person could breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> abdomen.|$|E

5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

5|$|After landing, {{members of}} Company E under Captain Leveridge {{were sent to}} take the {{railroad}} station, while Ellsworth, Major Charles Loeser, Lieutenant H. J. Winser and several men from Company A set out to secure the telegraph office. On the way there, Ellsworth spotted a Confederate flag atop the Marshall House inn. It was the same flag Ellsworth had seen for weeks from the White House during his visits with Lincoln. Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs. Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to <b>the</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>and</b> Cpl. Francis Brownell responded in kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, Phillips enlisted in the 20th (Service) Battalion Royal Fusiliers, and after refusing a commission, served as a Sergeant. The 20th Royal Fusiliers was one of four battalions of the {{regiment}} raised in 1914 by the Public Schools and University Men’s Force. Phillips was deployed to France with his unit on 16 November 1915. On the night of 14 March 1916, while out on a wiring party, he was shot through <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> killed, near Cambrin, France.|$|E

During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1951 the Israeli army summoned {{representatives of}} the World Lutheran Church to remove {{religious}} artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, {{on a tour of}} the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> asked for it to be opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In some people, {{the disease}} {{proceeds}} to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is {{leakage of plasma}} from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs. There may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract. Shock (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.|$|E

Lacaille charted and designated 20 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Tau in 1756. Of these, he used the designations Eta, Pi and Tau twice each, for three sets of two stars close together, and omitted Omicron and Xi. He assigned Rho to a star that subsequent astronomers were unable to find.|$|E
5|$|The {{likelihood}} of developing paralytic polio increases with age, {{as does the}} extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis {{is the most likely}} consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases. In children under five years of age, paralysis of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive paralysis of <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> abdomen also affecting all four limbs—quadriplegia—is more likely. Paralysis rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the highest rates of paralysis (one in 200) are associated with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) are associated with type 2.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} {{bullet holes}} in both sides of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes in <b>the</b> <b>chest</b> <b>and</b> wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He {{was finally able to}} get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E
