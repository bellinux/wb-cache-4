500|$|Claire, {{still searching}} for her brother, is a playable {{for the bulk of}} [...] (2000), set three months after the events of Resident Evil 2. After an {{unsuccessful}} infiltration of Umbrella's medical branch in Paris, Claire finds herself imprisoned on Umbrella-owned Rockfort Island. She escapes following another viral outbreak caused by a rival corporation of Umbrella's and teams up with fellow ex-prisoner Steve Burnside. Claire manages to discover the whereabouts of her brother and send a message to Leon. Claire, Steve and the arriving Chris escape from the island, only to find themselves in another of Umbrella's secret labs, this time in Antarctica, before they are taken captive by the antagonist Alexia Ashford. The second half of the game follows Chris trying to save his captured sister from Umbrella. Chris finds his way into the Antarctic lab and rescues her before their final battle with Alexia, which costs Steve's life, and the siblings escape from the facility via the <b>transport</b> <b>airplane</b> he used to get there. During the game's ending they vow {{to put an end to}} the Umbrella Corporation. In the PlayStation 2 version, Veronica X, Claire also has a brief encounter with the series' main villain Albert Wesker that would have resulted in her death had Wesker not been called away by his associates.|$|E
2500|$|The Question Mark was re-engined with [...] Wright R-975 {{engines in}} 1931, {{and in the}} {{practice}} of the day was redesignated a [...] "C-7". It served out its service life as a <b>transport</b> <b>airplane,</b> first for the 22nd Observation Squadron at Pope Field, North Carolina, and then with the 47th School Squadron at Randolph Field, Texas. [...] Ironically, its operational life came to an end when it ran out of fuel in flight on November 3, 1932. The aircraft was severely damaged trying to land at Davenport Auxiliary Field, [...] north of the base, and was surveyed (scrapped) in 1934. A major component of the refueling device is in the collections of the Historical Society of Berks County in Reading, Pennsylvania.|$|E

Tests included short-field approaches over [...] obstructions, and operational abilities over rough, unprepared fields and roads with simulated full loads. Initial landing tests were conducted at the municipal airport at Crestview, Florida.

2500|$|Although Brower's {{background}} {{was in the}} wilderness preservation wing of the conservation movement, he quickly led FOE to take {{on many of the}} issues raised by the new environmentalists. [...] FOE campaigned against the Alaska pipeline, the supersonic <b>transport</b> <b>airplane</b> (SST), nuclear power, {{and the use of the}} defoliant Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. [...] After Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, FOE led the opposition to Interior secretary James G. Watt's efforts to sell and lease public lands in the West and develop land adjacent to the National Parks. [...] Brower retired as executive director of FOE on its tenth anniversary in 1979, but continued as chairman of its board of directors. [...] FOE's growing debt and tension between Washington lobbying and grassroots action led to a crisis between Brower and a majority of the board that recalled his conflict with the Sierra Club board. [...] Facing staff cuts in 1984, Brower appealed over the board directly to the membership for emergency contributions. [...] He was removed from the board for insubordination, but was reinstated when he threatened a lawsuit. [...] In 1985 the board voted to close the San Francisco office and move to Washington, D.C.. [...] A referendum of the membership supported the board majority, and Brower resigned in 1986 to work through his Earth Island Institute.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years NASA {{has taken the}} lead role in {{exploiting}} the benefits of textile reinforced composite materials for application to aircraft structures. The NASA Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) program was started in 1989 to develop composite primary structures for commercial <b>transport</b> <b>airplanes</b> with costs that are competitive with metal structures. As part of this program, several contractors investigated the cost, weight, and performance attributes of textile reinforced composites. Textile composites made using resin transfer molding type processes were evaluated for numerous applications. Methods were also developed to predict resin infiltration and flow in textile preforms and to predict and measure mechanical properties of the textile composites.
