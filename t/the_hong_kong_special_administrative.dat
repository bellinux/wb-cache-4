Officially, <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Special</b> Adminstrative Region (HKSAR) is under the framework of "one country, two systems" and "one country, two currencies". Hence monetary integration was never in the pipeline. However, is the existence of separate currencies consistent with the fast changing economic reality?

If so, what are the preconditions for the options? What {{needs to be done to}} prepare for them?

It emerges that the status quo is optimal in the foreseeable future. ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{election}} of Leung Chun-ying as the fourth chief executive (CE) of <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Special</b> Admininstration Region (HKSAR), <b>the</b> people of <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> are keen {{to have a new}} government with policy visions and leadership.

The inability of the HKSAR governments to address these problems {{has its roots in the}} governing system in general and the institutional design for selecting the CE and forming the executive in particular. This chapter therefore first examines the establishment and functions of the executive of the HKSAR, and then the way the CE and the executive govern, and their interaction with the Legislative Council (Legco) in terms of general policy-making and budgetary decision-making processes.

They were initially convicted before the magistrate, but were eventually acquitted of all charges by the Court of Final Appeal.

On the other hand, the Hong Kong Police arrested two men and charged them with criminal damage when they attacked a Falun Gong promotional stand in Mong Kok.|$|E

Their number varied from 4 to 16 over time, hence rendering the statutory restriction scheme inapplicable. It was still possible to access the Liaison Office via a vehicular driveway. After warnings were ignored by the demonstrators, the superintendent in charge ordered his officers to arrest and remove them. The demonstrators resisted arrest but were eventually forcibly removed using heavy-handed tactics and loaded on board police vehicles. When they arrived at the police station, female demonstrators refused to leave the vehicles. Police officers took action to carry them off the vehicles but the demonstrators resisted and assaulted the officers.|$|E
25|$|As head of each {{district}} office, {{the district}} officer is {{the representative of}} <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Administrative</b> Region Government at the district level. He has the responsibility of overseeing directly {{the operation of the}} District Administration Scheme in the district. He is charged with implementing and co-ordinating the execution of district programmes, ensuring that the advice of the district council is properly followed up, and promoting residents' participation in district affairs. In addition, he is required to maintain close liaison with different sectors of the community and reflect their concerns and problems to the Government. It is his duty to ensure that district problems are resolved promptly through inter-departmental consultation and co-operation. Also, he acts as a link between the district council and departments and serves as a mediator between them when problems arise. The district officer is also involved with the community at every level. He has a role to mediate in the resolution of disputes between corporate bodies and residents. He performs an advisory and liaison role in providing assistance to building management bodies. He operates a public enquiry service to enable the community to have easy access to services and information provided by government. In emergency situations, the district officer is responsible for co-ordinating various departments' efforts on the ground for ensuring the effective provision of relief services.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses how the Government of <b>the</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> <b>Special</b> Administration Region has {{tackled the}} issue of preschool quality over the past 30 years. Although early childhood education {{is not part of}} the publicly funded education system, there is almost universal preschool attendance among three to six year olds. The government regulates, monitors and evaluates early childhood services, and has taken numerous steps to improve the quality of early childhood provision. However, a paradox lurks within government policy. On one hand, the facility-focused and provider-focused regulatory standards for the operation of preschools have been faulted for being too lax; but, on the other hand, policies and incentives have clearly improved the quality of preschool education. These include measures to support the upgrading of serving kindergarten teachers and an emphasis on quality assurance. The implementation of enabling policies is essential to ensure that all children have access to high-quality early education and care. © 2009 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
