25|$|In 1964 a {{by-election}} set {{the model}} for future NDP campaigns. Under the campaign management of Gerald Caplan, Stephen Lewis, and Marjorie Pinney the NDP canvassed every household three times, identified all their supporters, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> out the vote. This strategy {{is also known as}} PIG, Persuade, Identify, Get out the vote. Lawyer Jim Renwick won with 7,287 votes compared to 5,774 votes for the Conservatives and 5,771 votes for the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were {{different}} on radio <b>then.</b> <b>They</b> <b>got</b> enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E
500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the low side, by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, {{the very act of}} compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said that most of the money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it, and that's it. They never showed us any accounts, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> bought out by Sony." ...|$|E

500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E
2500|$|But the Browns {{then drove}} 68-yards to score on Mack's 1-yard {{touchdown}} run with 1:57 {{left on the}} clock, on a drive that was aided by a roughing the passer penalty on Mark Gastineau that nullified an incompletion on second down and 24 from Cleveland's 18-yard line. After a failed onside kick attempt, the Browns stopped New York on two consecutive runs and then sacked O'Brien on a quarterback draw, bringing up 4th down on the Browns 48-yard line. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> another lucky break when a punt that would have pinned them inside their own 10-yard line was called back by a Jets holding penalty. On the second punt, Gerald McNeil returned the ball 10 yards to the Browns 32 with 53 seconds on the clock and no timeouts left. Following a 26-yard pass interference penalty on New York defensive back Carl Howard, Kosar completed a 37-yard pass to wide receiver Webster Slaughter on the Jets 5-yard line with 37 seconds to go. [...] However, the Browns hurt themselves with excessive celebration after the catch, costing them several seconds before Kosar could break them up and get his team back {{to the line of}} scrimmage. [...] The clock ran down to 15 seconds before the next snap, in which Kosar threw a pass that was broken up and nearly intercepted by Carter. [...] Now with 11 seconds and no timeouts remaining, the Browns decided to play for overtime and had Moseley kick a game-tying 22-yard field goal.|$|E

6000|$|And <b>then,</b> when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> home, {{very hungry}} after their toil, Mr. Townsend made another apology for the poorness of his table.

6000|$|... "No; he'd {{paid for}} it. That is to say, either he had or he hadn't. That {{was what they}} {{wanted to get out of}} him, and I'm blessed if he didn't take 'em till the judge wouldn't set there any longer. And <b>then</b> <b>they</b> hadn't <b>got</b> it out of him." ...|$|R

They asked me to play, and as I couldn't work just then, I consented, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> me to put up some money,--just to make it interestin', they said. They let me win a little at first, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> me to put up more and more, and then they cheated me and wiped me out!" ...|$|E

60|$|Herbert {{promised that}} he would take this advice, and he thought himself that among other things he might go over to inspect that Clady boiler, and of course call at Desmond Court on his way.

50|$|The {{team was}} {{introduced}} in Showcase #27 (July-August 1960) - #29 (November-December 1960). <b>They</b> <b>then</b> <b>got</b> their own title which lasted 35 issues (1961-67).|$|R
60|$|They stormed and raged, and {{threatened}} and pleaded {{for a quarter}} of an hour or so, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> sick, and slammed the door, and went off, leaving the Government to lose the fifty-four marks.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{the boys}} hung around Plankville {{for an hour}} longer. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> aboard of the Dartaway, and with Tom at the wheel, and Dick {{with a pair of}} field glasses to his eyes, swung in several circles about the neighborhood.|$|E

60|$|After {{rambling}} {{about these}} grounds for some time, the party went {{back through the}} yard of the hotel to the village. There they dismissed the boy. Mr. Holiday gave him half a franc for guiding them. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> into their carriage again, and rode on.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> up {{and went}} forward. Now a little before them stood an oak; and under it, {{when they came to}} it, they found an old pilgrim fast asleep; they knew that he was a pilgrim by his clothes, and his staff, and his girdle.|$|E

60|$|Belle {{showed the}} boys where the animals might be tethered, {{and they took}} {{particular}} care to fasten the steeds properly, as Sid Todd had instructed them. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> out their fishing-rods, and also that of Belle, and baited up with the artificial flies they had brought along.|$|E
