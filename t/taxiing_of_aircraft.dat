The study on path planning for <b>taxi</b> <b>of</b> carrier <b>aircraft</b> launching under actual deck environment is of great significance. In actual deck scheduling, manual command is applied to <b>taxi</b> <b>of</b> carrier <b>aircraft,</b> which has negative effects on the safety of staff and carrier aircraft launching. In consideration of both the safety and efficiency <b>of</b> carrier <b>aircraft</b> launching, the key elements of the problem are abstracted based on the analysis of deck environment, carrier aircraft maneuver performance and task requirements. According to the problem description, the mathematical model is established including various constraints. The carrier aircraft and the obstacles are reasonably simplified as circle and polygons respectively. Whatâ€™s more, the proposed collision detection model reduces the calculations. Aimed at the features of model, the theory of model predictive control (MPC) {{is applied to the}} path search. Then a dynamic weight heuristic function is designed and a dynamic multistep optimization algorithm is proposed. Taking the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier as an example, the paths from parking place to catapult are planned, which indicate the rationality of the model and the effectiveness of the algorithm by comparing the planning results under different simulation environments. The main contribution of research is the establishment of obstacle avoidance and path planning model.

The Spot And Runway Departure Advisor is designed to aid controllers in managing aircraft surface operations {{and is based on}} two optimization algorithms: the Spot Release Planner and the Runway Scheduler. The Spot Release Planner provides sequence and timing advisories to the Ground controller for releasing departure aircraft into the aircraft movement area to reduce taxi delay while achieving maximum throughput. The Runway Scheduler provides take-off and arrival runway crossing sequences to the Local controller to maximize runway usage. Performance metrics from the simulation include delay, number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> stops, fuel consumption, and aircraft engine emissions. The results were not consistent among the different traffic scenarios. Results from high traffic scenarios show the average departure delay and number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> stops in the movement area were reduced by 64 and 68 percent, respectively. Fuel consumption and engine emissions were reduced by as much as 38 percent. There was a slight reduction in <b>taxi</b> time <b>of</b> arrival <b>aircraft</b> even if the emphasis of the tool was on departure traffic.

40|$|The airport ground {{movement}} {{problem is}} one of the most important among airport ground operations as it connects runway sequencing and the gate or stand allocation problem. The main goal of the ground movement problem is to find optimal routes and schedules for all aircraft moving on the airport surface. With increasing air traffic, rising fuel costs and tighter environmental targets the efficient operation of the ground movement in terms of time and fuel consumption is becoming a more pressing issue. Therefore, in this paper a multi-objective optimisation problem is presented to simultaneously optimise departure schedules and speed profiles <b>of</b> <b>taxiing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> To solve this problem a genetic algorithm is adopted to investigate the trade-off between the total taxi time and fuel consumption.

40|$|As {{the amount}} of air traffic {{increases}} over the years, most airports simply {{do not have the}} means of expanding to handle the intensified traffic on the surface that will ensue. Precise surveillance equipment and automation concepts, as well as advanced surface traffic algorithms are being developed to improve airport efficiency. These surface algorithms require inputs unique to each airport to ensure maximum efficiency, and minimal taxi delay. This study analyzes surface traffic at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) to determine the effect of the number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the surface and {{the amount of}} stop and go situations they experience to the amount <b>of</b> additional <b>taxi</b> time encountered. If the surface capacity of an airport is known, minimal delay can be accomplished by limiting the number <b>of</b> <b>taxiing</b> <b>aircraft</b> to that capacity. This concept is related to highways, where traffic flow drastically decreases as more cars occupy the road. An attempt to minimize this effect on highways is seen with the use of metering lights at freeway on-ramps. Since the surface traffic at airports is highly regulated, and aircraft are less mobile on the ground, limiting the surface count to a certain number can greatly reduce the amount <b>of</b> additional <b>taxi</b> time encountered, as well as reduce hazardous emissions. This study will also find the regions of an airport that encounter the most additional taxi time when the number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> in that area is increased. This could help surface traffic algorithms avoid congesting that area, or re-route aircraft to different runways when that area reaches its capacity. The relationship between the amount of stop and go situations an aircraft encounters and their effect on the <b>taxi</b> time <b>of</b> that <b>aircraft</b> will also be investigated. This will help to determine the effect <b>of</b> holding an <b>aircraft</b> on the taxiway as opposed to re-routing it. The lesser of the two should be used when developing surface traffic algorithms to further minimize the delay encountered. The fields investigated in this study include taxi time, the number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the surface, the number of stop and go situations, and the time stopped for each aircraft. Taxi time is defined as spot to runway for departures, and runway to spot for arrivals. It does not include ramp area taxi time because the ramp area is controlled differently, and surface traffic schedulers do not currently incorporate them. Taxi time is found by finding the difference between take-off time (OFF) and spot crossing time for departures, and spot crossing time and landing time (ON) for arrivals. All surface data was either found directly using the Surface Operations Data Analysis and Adaptation (SODAA), a tool to analyze the Surface Management System (SMS) generated log files, or indirectly from SODAA using Matlab to derive values from SODAA data. The number <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the surface is found by looping through the ON times, OFF times, and spot times for each aircraft during a particular day. For each departure aircraft, surface counts are taken at its spot crossing and OFF time. The average of these two is used as the surface count for that aircraft. For arrivals, surface counts are taken at its ON time and its spot crossing time. The average of these two is used...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} control {{strategy}} for airport operations that integrates the management of arrivals and departures. The strategy is based on four central ideas: (1) the objective <b>of</b> reducing <b>aircraft</b> flight times, taxi times and fuel burn, (2) the emphasis on developing models using data from actual aircraft operations, (3) the need to be compatible with current air tra+c control procedures, and (4) the requirement to not adversely a,ect airport performance. The scope of this work covers the airport surface and arrival airspace, which are two of the most congested regions of the air transportation network. A new approach is proposed for modeling airport surface operations. Drawing an analogy from the field of network congestion control, the airport surface is assumed to be a network consisting of major taxiways and their intersections. Posing the problem in this framework relaxes the re-quirement of precisely predicting the <b>taxi</b> time <b>of</b> each <b>aircraft,</b> instead emphasizing the accurate representation of the underlying stochastic processes.

This thesis investigates the possibility of reducing fuel burn and emissions from surface operations through a reduction <b>of</b> the <b>taxi</b> times <b>of</b> departing <b>aircraft.</b> Data analysis <b>of</b> the departing traffic in four major US airports provides a comprehensive assessment {{of the impact of}} surface congestion on taxi times, fuel burn and emissions. For this analysis two metrics are introduced: one that compares the taxi times to the unimpeded ones and another that evaluates them in terms of their contribution to the airport's throughput. A novel approach is proposed that models the aircraft departure process as a queuing system. The departure <b>taxi</b> (taxi-out) time <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft</b> is represented as a sum of three components: the unimpeded taxi-out time, the time spent in the departure queue, and the congestion delay due to ramp and taxiway interactions. The dependence of the taxi-out time on these factors is analyzed and modeled. The performance of the model is validated through a comparison of its predictions with observed data at Boston's Logan International Airport (BOS). A reduction in taxi times may be achieved through the queue management strategy known as N-Control, which controls the push back process so as to keep the number <b>of</b> departing <b>aircraft</b> {{on the surface of the}} airport below a specified threshold. The developed model is used to quantify the impact <b>of</b> N-Control on <b>taxi</b> times, delays, fuel burn and emissions at BOS.
