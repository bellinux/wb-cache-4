5|$|John Carson as the {{replacement}} Captain Foster ("White Ghost"). A British actor {{of television and}} cinema, Carson's small-screen credits of the 1960s and 70s include The Saint, Man in a Suitcase, Department S and The Professionals, while his film roles include Plague of the Zombies (1966) and Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970). His appearances in The Troubleshooters {{attracted the attention of}} the Andersons. Carson's delivery of Foster's lines has led to a mistaken assertion <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> British actor James Mason was cast for the role.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 1924 Bormann {{was sentenced}} {{to a year in}} Elisabethstrasse Prison as an {{accomplice}} to his friend Rudolf Höss in the murder of Walther Kadow. The perpetrators believed Kadow had tipped off the French occupation authorities in the Ruhr District <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Freikorps member Albert Leo Schlageter was carrying out sabotage operations against French industries. Schlageter was arrested and was executed on 23 May 1923. On the night of 31 May, Höss, Bormann and several others took Kadow into a meadow out of town, where he was beaten and his throat cut. After one of the perpetrators confessed, police dug up the body and laid charges in July. Bormann was released from prison in February 1925. He joined the Frontbann, a short-lived Nazi Party paramilitary organisation created to replace the Sturmabteilung (SA; storm detachment or assault division), which had been banned {{in the aftermath of the}} failed Munich Putsch. Bormann returned to his job at Mecklenburg and remained there until May 1926, when he moved in with his mother in Oberweimar.|$|E

In June 2016 it was reported <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> presenter LeBlanc had threatened to quit the show unless Evans was sacked, because of inappropriate behavior on set.

25|$|In 1927 the IFTU {{congress}} {{was held in}} Paris. At the congress, TUC confronted the continental unions. TUC demanded that the headquarters be shifted away from Amsterdam, that Purcell's mandate be renewed, and <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Briton Brown should be elected as the sole general secretary. In his speech to the congress, Purcell called {{for the inclusion of}} the Soviet union movement into the IFTU. The proposal was rejected by the leaders of continental unions.|$|E
25|$|In a 1985 {{issue of}} After the Battle Magazine, Les Taylor, a wartime {{member of the}} 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, claimed <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> yeoman Joe Ekins was {{responsible}} for the destruction of Wittmann's tank. Veteran and historian Ken Tout, a member of the same unit, published a similar account crediting Ekins. Historians have supported this position, and it became the widely accepted version of events. According to Hart, Ekin's unit was positioned in a wood on the right flank of the advancing Tiger tanks. At approximately 12:47, they engaged them, halting the attack, and killing Wittmann.|$|E
25|$|Six {{months after}} the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens, New York on November 12, 2001, Mohammed Mansour Jabarah agreed to {{cooperate}} with American authorities {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence. He said <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Canadian Abderraouf Jdey had been responsible for the flight's destruction, using a shoe bomb similar to that found on Reid several months earlier. This claim remains unsubstantiated by the investigation into the cause of the crash, however, Jabarah was a known colleague of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, and said that Reid and Jdey had both been enlisted by the al-Qaeda chief to participate in identical plots.|$|E

This information was verified and confirmed on the same day by a German newspaper. Unnamed American intelligence officials stated that sensors that traced the path of the missile, shrapnel patterns in the wreckage, voice print analysis of separatists' conversations in which they claimed credit for the strike, and photos and other data from social media sites all indicated that Russian-backed separatists had fired the missile.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Michigan {{became the}} nation's 24th right-to-work state. Prior to passage, Speaker Bolger {{was the sole}} {{legislative}} leader who supported right-to-work when other Michigan Republicans were lukewarm on the idea. The day Bolger was elected Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives he stated <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Republicans should join him in reviewing the potential for right-to-work legislation. During Bolger's term as Speaker, right-to-work legislation was introduced and passed by the House on December 6, 2012. The legislation was eventually signed by Governor Rick Snyder on December 11, 2012. Nearly two years after passage, Michigan has seen more than 75,000 new jobs have been created in the state.|$|E

25|$|No Glaswegian {{troops were}} deployed, with the {{government}} fearing <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Glaswegians, soldiers or otherwise, might {{go over to the}} workers' side if a revolutionary situation developed. Under the orders of Field Marshal Sir William Robertson, Scottish regiments were transported to Glasgow from other parts of Scotland, specifically to avert this possible scenario. Troops from the Highland Light Infantry were also transported from Maryhill Barracks from Maryhill Central railway station to Buchanan Street railway station but without their Glaswegian men. Other troops, including the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, Gordon Highlanders and Seaforth Highlanders, arrived from Stirling Castle, Redford Barracks and Fort George into Queen Street Station.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with WKYT-TV in July, Barr further elaborated on his platform. Declaring {{his support for the}} free market, he denounced the recently signed Dodd–Frank Act that enacted new regulations on the banking industry. He {{called for an end to}} the practice of politicians earmarking funds for special projects in their districts, a position that put him at odds with state party leaders like McConnell and long-time 5th district Congressman Hal Rogers. Although he supported strengthening security along the U.S. border with Mexico to curb illegal immigration, he stated his belief <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul's plan to deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|The Coalition {{government}} panicked, {{fearing a}} possible threat to order {{or even a}} Bolshevik-style insurrection. It was only fourteen months since the Russian Revolution, and the German Revolution was still in progress in January 1919. Troops based in the city's Maryhill barracks were locked inside their post, with troops and tanks from elsewhere being sent into the city to control unrest and extinguish any revolution that should break out. No Glaswegian troops were deployed, and few veterans, with the government fearing <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> Glaswegians might sympathise with the strikers if a revolutionary situation developed in Glasgow. Young, mostly untried, troops were transported from camps and barracks {{around the country and}} stationed on the streets of Glasgow, specifically to combat this possibility.|$|E

25|$|From 2010 to 2016 {{she was one}} of {{the judges}} on BBC One's The Great British Bake Off {{alongside}} baker Paul Hollywood, who specialises in bread. Berry says that since working together, she has learned from him. However, some viewers were outraged during the first series when a decision was made to make the contestants use one of Hollywood's recipes for scones instead of one of Berry's. Her work on the show with Hollywood has led to The Guardian suggesting that it is the best reality TV judging partnership ever. In September 2016, Love Productions announced that a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4 instead of the BBC from 2017 had been agreed. Co-hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins announced that they would not be continuing with Bake Off on its new network. Berry announced she was also leaving Bake Off on the same day <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> judge Paul Hollywood announced he would be staying with the show.|$|E
25|$|Legends often paint {{underground}} kobolds as evil creatures. In medieval mining towns, people {{prayed for}} protection from them. They were blamed for the accidents, cave-ins, and rock slides that plagued human miners. One favoured kobold prank was to fool miners into taking worthless ore. For example, 16th-century miners sometimes encountered {{what looked to be}} rich veins of copper or silver, but which, when smelted, proved to be little more than a pollutant and could even be poisonous. These ores caused a burning sensation to those who handled them. Miners tried to appease the kobolds with offerings of gold and silver and by insisting <b>that</b> <b>fellow</b> miners treat them respectfully. Nevertheless, some stories claim that kobolds only returned such kindness with more poisonous ores. Miners called these ores cobalt after the creatures from whom they were thought to come. In 1735, Swedish chemist Georg Brandt isolated a substance from such ores and named it cobalt rex. In 1780, scientists showed that this was in fact a new element, which they named cobalt.|$|E
