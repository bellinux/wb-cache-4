5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient {{based on the}} concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). <b>The</b> <b>equations</b> that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to <b>the</b> <b>equations</b> that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work.|$|E

5|$|The signs s1, s2 and s3 on the {{right-hand}} sides of <b>the</b> <b>equations</b> may be chosen in eight possible ways, and each choice of signs gives up to two solutions, since the equation for r's is quadratic. This might suggest (incorrectly) that there are up to sixteen solutions of Apollonius' problem. However, due to a symmetry of <b>the</b> <b>equations,</b> if (r's, x's, y's) is a solution, with signs s'i, then so is (−r's, x's, y's), with opposite signs −s'i, which represents the same solution circle. Therefore, Apollonius' problem has at most eight independent solutions (Figure2). One way to avoid this double-counting is to consider only solution circles with non-negative radius.|$|E

5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving <b>the</b> <b>equations</b> of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with <b>the</b> <b>equations</b> of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell also {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which <b>the</b> <b>equations</b> were valid, with the distasteful result that <b>the</b> <b>equations</b> changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.|$|E
