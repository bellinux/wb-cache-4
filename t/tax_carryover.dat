40|$|The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA, P. L. 107 - 16) repeals {{the estate}} tax in 2010. During the {{phase-out}} period, the new law increases the exempt amount to $ 3. 5 million by 2009 ($ 1. 5 million in 2005), lowers the top rate to 45 % by 2007 (the top rate in 2005 is 47 %), and repeals the federal credit for state death taxes in 2005. The federal gift tax remains though the rate is reduced to the top personal income tax rate (35 % in 2005). After repeal of the estate <b>tax,</b> <b>carryover</b> basis replaces step-up in basis for assets transferred at death. The legislation includes an exemption from carryover basis for capital gains of $ 1. 3 million (and an additional $ 3 million for a surviving spouse). However, {{the estate tax}} provision in EGTRRA automatically sunsets December 31, 2010...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{attempted}} {{to address the question}} of how the exchange medium in acquisitions is determined. A number of hypotheses are proposed for this study. After model development, a univariate analysis as well as a binomial logit estimate are conducted with the variables {{selected on the basis of}} a set of proposed hypotheses. ^ Above all, it appears that the cash flow theory best accounts for the determination of payment method. The significances of the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s cash flow and Q ratio reveal that low growth firms with large free cash flow may have the flexibility to support a management-led acquisition or a recapitalization that might include a big cash payout to shareholders. ^ The acquisition strategy hypothesis is also supported in this study. The binary variable for the existence of competing bid turns out to have the largest t-statistic in all analysis. ^ There is mixed support for the optimal capital structure hypothesis and Hansen model 2 ̆ 7 s implications. The results suggest that consideration of both the bidder and target 2 ̆ 7 s debt ratio influences the decision to some extent although it is not a major determinant in the payment method decision. ^ The support for the information asymmetry assertion which argues that overvalued (undervalued) bidders use stock (cash) payment seems to depend on which proxy variable is used for the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s valuation. With these results we can not conclude that the payment method is directly related to the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s valuation. ^ While we verify that the <b>tax</b> <b>carryover</b> variable is neutral to the choice of the payment method, we failed to provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis that the target 2 ̆ 7 s step-up basis has a positive effect on the cash payments. The inability to measure such tax benefits precisely is a critical problem. Step-up basis variable is significantly positive when using the data of replacement cost from a 10 -k file, but it is insignificant when the data of estimated replacement cost is used. ...|$|E

50|$|Tax shelter offsets {{occur in}} one of three ways: {{depreciation}} (which may sometimes be accelerated), <b>tax</b> credits, and <b>carryover</b> losses which reduce tax liability charged against income from other sources for a period of 27.5 years. Some tax shelter benefits can be transferable, depending on the laws governing tax liability in the jurisdiction where the property is located. These can be sold to others for a cash return or other benefit.|$|R
40|$|For {{close to}} a century, an {{important}} (but unfortunate) feature of the Internal Revenue Code has been a rule that the tax basis of any inherited asset is made equal to its fair market value {{at the time of}} the decedent’s death. Notwithstanding the substantial revenue losses associated with this rule, Congress has retained it for reasons of administrative convenience. But from three different vantage points, pressure has been mounting to change what is commonly referred to as the “step-up in basis rule. ” First, politicians and commentators have historically tied the step-up in basis rule to the estate tax on the theory that income be taxed only once, rather than twice. However, with the recent emasculation of the transfer tax regime, no estate tax is levied in most cases, while taxpayers routinely capitalize on the step-up in basis rule. On another front, technological advances have greatly simplified tax basis identification and record keeping, making a <b>carryover</b> <b>tax</b> basis regime eminently feasible, which it previously was not. Finally, in an era of growing income inequality, retention of a clearly defective rule that primarily benefits the wealthy seems wholly unjustified. Congress essentially has two different reform options to consider; namely, a deemed realization rule or a <b>carryover</b> <b>tax</b> basis rule. While a deemed realization rule has many advantages, it appears to be politically unachievable, at least for the time being, due to liquidity and administrative concerns. On the other hand, in light of the fact that a <b>carryover</b> <b>tax</b> basis rule is widely utilized, vetted, and accepted in the related context of inter vivos gifts, extending its application to transfers at death appears entirely feasible. Its institution would have many virtues, including improved administrability, equity, and revenue generation...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} new result on lotteries [...] - that a well-funded {{syndicate}} has a purely mechanical strategy to achieve expected returns of 10 % to 25 % in an equiprobable lottery with no take and no carryover pool. We prove that an optimal strategy (Nash equilibrium) {{in a game}} between the syndicate and other players consists of betting one of each ticket (the "trump ticket"), and extend that result to proportional ticket selection in non-equiprobable lotteries. The strategy can be adjusted to accommodate lottery <b>taxes</b> and <b>carryover</b> pools. No "irrationality" need be involved for the strategy to succeed [...] - it requires only that {{a large group of}} non-syndicate bettors each choose a few tickets independently.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the role of the}} estate, gift and generation-skipping {{transfer}} taxes within the federal tax system has become increasingly controversial. The future of the transfer taxes remains unsettled, despite recently enacted legislation that moves in the direction of repeal with a delayed effective date. This paper looks at transfer tax repeal in terms of its repercussions {{on the rest of the}} tax system, with special emphasis on the income tax treatment of property transferred by gift or bequest. Repeal of the transfer taxes would reduce the progressivity of the overall tax system, exacerbate existing inequities with respect to transfers of appreciated property, and sharpen the need for income tax reform. In response, Congress could impose a deathtime gains <b>tax,</b> adopt a <b>carryover</b> basis regime, or conceivably tax gifts and bequests as income to the recipient. Each of these alternatives raises significant issues of structure and implementation which deserve closer scrutiny. In all likelihood, Congress will reconsider the issue of transfer tax repeal during the next ten years. Instead of focusing narrowly on the shortcomings of the existing transfer taxes, the debate should include careful weighing of the potential advantages and disadvantages of the available alternatives...|$|R
