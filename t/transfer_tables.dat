Marsh's first rack patent shows such an arrangement, and the {{original}} Mount Washington Cog Railway he built had no turnouts. It was not until 1941 that a turnout was constructed on this line. [...] There were more turnouts built for the line but all were hand operated. In 2003, a new automatic hydraulic turnout was developed and built at the base as a prototype. With the success of the new turnout, more new automatic hydraulic turnouts were built to replace the hand-operated ones. The new turnouts installed on the Mount Washington line in 2007 are essentially <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b> The Locher rack also requires <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|E

After the new main workshop at Heiterblick was opened, the majority of workshop activity could be moved there. In order to simply depot access, the <b>transfer</b> <b>tables</b> were removed in October 1928 and the former workshop shed was connected directly to the Wittenberger Straße.

50|$|On {{the site}} of today's Lindenau motorbus depot, a tram depot and {{workshop}} was established in 1899. The latter had a notable characteristic: {{only one of the}} four tracks was connected to the tram network. The others were accessed by transfer table. Within a year, a power plant and an additional tramcar shed had already been built. A third tramcar shed, with transfer table, was built in 1907. Following construction of the new depots, the last tramcars working Line P were relocated to Probstheida Depot. The oldest tramcar shed was converted into a trackless workshop building. Nevertheless, in the same year, a new workshop building was opened, which tramcars could access only on <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b> In 1924, another workshop was established at Hinterfeld, with most of the tracks connected by a new transfer table. These complicated facilities as well as the ever-growing number of buses made a new solution urgently necessary.|$|E
50|$|Rosterminalugol {{ensures the}} {{automated}} process of coal handling from rail transport to sea-going transport. The unloading of coal laden cars {{is carried out}} by two modern high-technology railcar rotary dumpers allowing the simultaneous discharge of four gondola cars in a maximum of 3 minutes. Therefore, the method excludes any mechanical damages possible during a grab discharge to the movable equipment of railway system. For {{the first time in}} Russia the traversers were used and have been successfully utilized for the prompt formation of empty rolling stock. With the help of these <b>transfer</b> <b>tables</b> it is possible to expedite railcar supply to several parallel tracks without additional railroad switches. The railcar thawing system equipped with infrared transmitters operate to ensure uninterrupted discharge of loaded cars in the winter season. After discharge the coal is transferred to the conveyor belt through the grid with cells of 280 mm diameter. After that, having come through the aspiration equipment, the coal is automatically transported through the system of conveyor lines, to one of four warehouses or directly to a ship, depending on the loading scheme. The loading to the ships is performed by two high-technology loading machines on two berths, which enable simultaneous handling of two Panamax vessels.|$|E

The novelty in our approach is that it unifies different aspects of system synthesis and alleviates the need to change bases to reason about different facets of a design. Behavior tables can model indirection in system specification, by allowing names of registers and states to be treated as values. Behavior tables provide an environment for transformational design to derive a formally "correct" implementation from a specification. The emphasis of our work is on design correctness rather than design automation. Herein, we develop implementation relations over different facets of behavior tables. A set of transformations on the different facets of behavior tables, that preserve the implementation relations on the facets, are presented. Behavior tables and the transfor [...] ...|$|E

40|$|State-of-the-art natural {{language}} processing models are anything but compact. Syntactic parsers have huge grammars, machine translation systems have huge <b>transfer</b> <b>tables,</b> and so on {{across a range of}} tasks. With such complexity come two challenges. First, how can we learn highly complex models? Second, how can we efficiently infer optimal structures within them?Hierarchical coarse-to-fine methods address both questions. Coarse-to-fine approaches exploit a sequence of models which introduce complexity gradually. At the top of the sequence is a trivial model in which learning and inference are both cheap. Each subsequent model refines the previous one, until a final, full-complexity model is reached. Because each refinement introduces only limited complexity, both learning and inference can be done in an incremental fashion. In this dissertation, we describe several coarse-to-fine systems. In the domain of syntactic parsing, complexity is in the grammar. We present a latent variable approach which begins with an X-bar grammar and learns to iteratively refine grammar categories. For example, noun phrases might be split into subcategories for subjects and objects, singular and plural, and so on. This splitting process admits an efficient incremental inference scheme which reduces parsing times by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it produces the best parsing accuracies across an array of languages, in a fully language-general fashion. In the domain of acoustic modeling for speech recognition, complexity is needed to model the rich phonetic properties of {{natural language}}s. Starting from a mono-phone model, we learn increasingly refined models that capture phone internal structures, as well as context-dependent variations in an automatic way. Our approaches reduces error rates compared to other baseline approaches, while streamlining the learning procedure. In the domain of machine translation, complexity arises because there and too many target language word types. To manage this complexity, we translate into target language clusterings of increasing vocabulary size. This approach gives dramatic speed-ups while additionally increasing final translation quality...|$|E
40|$|The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instruments}} are spatially-scanning UV spectrometers that have produced daily global images of total ozone {{over the last}} 21 years since {{the launch of the}} Nimbus 7 satellite. The instruments use a total ozone retrieval algorithm pioneered by J. V. Dave and C. L. Mateer for the Nimbus 4 Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) instrument, designed by D. F. Heath. The TOMS ozone maps have revealed the relations between total ozone and atmospheric dynamics, and shown the dramatic losses of ozone in the Antarctic ozone hole and the Northern hemisphere. The accepted long-term trends in global, regional, and local ozone are derived from data from the Nimbus 7 TOMS and three successive TOMS flights on Russian, Japanese, and American satellites. The next TOMS flight will be launched in 2000. The contiguous mapping design and fortuitous choice of TOMS wavelengths bands also permitted imaging of a second atmospheric gas, sulfur dioxide, which is transient due to its short lifetime. The importance of this measurement was first realized after the eruption of El Chichon volcano in 1982. The extreme range of sizes of volcanic eruptions and the associated danger require observations from a distant observing platform. The first quantitative time series of the input of sulfur dioxide by explosive volcanic eruptions into the atmosphere thus was developed from the TOMS missions. Finally, the Rayleigh and aerosol scattering spectral characteristic and reflectivity complete the four dominant pieces of information in the near UV albedo of the Earth. The four parameters are derived with a linear algorithm, the absorption coefficients of the gases, and effective paths computed from radiative <b>transfer</b> <b>tables.</b> Absorbing aerosol clouds (smoke, dust, volcanic ash) are readily identified by their deviation from a Rayleigh signature. The greatest shortcoming of the TOMS dataset is the 24 hour time resolution that is produced by the polar orbit of the satellite. Dynamic phenomena, such as upper air fronts that modulate total ozone and volcanic eruptions of sulfur dioxide and ash, cannot be adequately resolved. It is hoped that UV observations from geostationary satellites will soon be made to test the value of this unique information in weather forecasting and aviation safety...|$|E
