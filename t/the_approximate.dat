40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{econometrics}} of computed dynamic models. Since these models generally lack a closed-form solution, economists <b>approximate</b> <b>the</b> policy {{functions of the}} agents in the model with numerical methods. But this implies that, instead of the exact likelihood function, the researcher can evaluate only an approximated likelihood associated with <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> policy function. What are the consequences for inference of <b>the</b> use of <b>approximated</b> likelihoods? First, we show that as <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> policy function converges to the exact policy, <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> likelihood also converges to the exact likelihood. Second, we prove that <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> likelihood converges {{at the same rate}} as <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> policy function. Third, we find that the error in <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> likelihood gets compounded with the size of the sample. Fourth, we discuss convergence of Bayesian and classical estimates. We complete the paper with three applications to document the quantitative importance of our results. ...|$|R

30|$|Association {{performance}} is {{also influenced by}} the discrepancy between <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> coverage and <b>the</b> actual coverage. When <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> coverage {{is greater than the}} actual coverage, positions of objects with nonregistered identifications can be estimated within <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> coverage. Then, a group or incomplete group association increases by the condition in (5) or (11). This can frequently occur when objects move around the boundary of coverage of an identification sensor. Moreover, the effect of <b>the</b> smaller <b>approximated</b> coverage than <b>the</b> actual coverage is similar to the effect of <b>the</b> larger <b>approximated</b> coverage than actual coverage. Since the number of registered identifications is different from the number of estimated positions within <b>the</b> <b>approximated</b> coverage, this may increase group or incomplete group associations. However, the estimated positions of objects are eventually identified when single associations are established. While the inaccurate coverage model may delay the establishment of single associations, the number of single associations eventually increases by the object dynamics.|$|R
