40|$|New {{textile fibers}} have been {{developed}} or modified to meet the complex and constraining criteria of space applications. The most common of these criteria are light weight, nonflammability or flame retardancy, and high strength and durability in both deep space environment and the oxygen enriched crew bay area of the spacecraft. The fibers which successfully pass the <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> and toxicity, and display the desired mechanical properties are selected for space applications. Such advanced fibers developed for the Crew and Thermal Systems Division (CTSD) at the Johnson Space Center include 'Beta' fiber, heat stabilized polybenzimidazole and polyimide, as well as modified aramid Durette(TM), multi-fibrous Ortho(TM) fabric, and flame resistant cotton. The physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of these fibers are briefly discussed. The testing capabilities in the CTSD laboratory to ascertain some of the properties {{of these and other}} fibrous materials are also discussed. Most of these materials developed for spacecraft, space suit, and flight equipment applications have found other commercial applications. These advanced textile fibers are used mostly for aircraft, transportation, public buildings, hospitals, and protective clothing applications...|$|R

40|$|Microgravity <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> and {{flame spread}} were {{performed}} in a low-speed flow tunnel to simulate spacecraft ventilation flows. Three thin fuels were tested for flammability (Ultem 1000 (General Electric Company), 10 mil film, Nomex (Dupont) HT 90 - 40, and Mylar G (Dupont) and one fuel for flame spread testing (Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.). The 1 g Upward Limiting Oxygen Index (ULOI) and 1 g Maximum Oxygen Concentration (MOC) {{are found to be}} greater than those in 0 g, by up to 4 % oxygen mole fraction, meaning that the fuels burned in 0 g at lower oxygen concentrations than they did using the NASA Standard 6001 Test 1 protocol. Flame spread tests with Kimwipes were used to develop correlations that capture the effects of flow velocity, oxygen concentration, and pressure on flame spread rate. These correlations were used to determine that over virtually the entire range of spacecraft atmospheres and flow conditions, the opposed spread is faster, especially for normoxic atmospheres. The correlations were also compared with 1 g MOC for various materials as a function of pressure and oxygen. The lines of constant opposed flow agreed best with the 1 g MOC trends, which indicates that Test 1 limits are essentially dictated by the critical heat flux for ignition. Further evaluation of these and other materials is continuing to better understand the 0 g <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> materials and its effect on the oxygen margin of safety...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe energy hazard {{criteria}} of ASTM program CHETAH have been <b>tested</b> as criteria <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> gaseous mixtures containing an hydrocarbon vapour and air as oxidiser, at lean concentrations. A method for calculating the lower flammability limits in air, at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature, is proposed {{as a result}} of a statistical study, which involved 67 combustible compounds. CHETAH's fourth energy hazard criterion was found to be the most reliable flammability criterion. The method is predictive since all the input data may be obtained with very good accuracy using a group contribution method. It is reliable, predicted limits being more frequently underevaluated, by 0. 11 mol% on average, than overevaluated. The method is also precise, with a standard deviation of the estimates of 0. 14 mol%. It is easily applicable to fuel mixtures and gives the same results as Le Chatelier's law...|$|R

Ratings referred to under the UL 94 category are deemed generally acceptable for compliance with this requirement as this cover <b>tests</b> for <b>flammability</b> <b>of</b> polymeric materials used for parts in devices and appliances. Although there are 12 flame classifications specified in UL 94, there are 6 which relate to materials commonly used in manufacturing enclosures, structural parts and insulators found in consumer electronic products. These are 5VA, 5VB, V-0, V-1, V-2 and HB.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents the}} investigation of the influence of flame retardant concentration on the <b>flammability</b> properties <b>of</b> various kinds of cellulose fibres. The industrial flame retardant Aflamit®KWB (Thor GmbH, Germany) reagent and the yarns of three kinds of cellulose fibres (cotton, flax and peat) of linear density 200 ± 10 tex have been chosen for investigation. The various concentration of flame retardant reagent was used for all kinds of yarns. The basic concentration of Aflamit®KWB was chosen according to the Thor GmbH standard recommended for the application. Also, the concentration was used 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 16 times lower than the basic concentration. The horizontal <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> yarn’s <b>flammability</b> (time <b>of</b> burning) and vertical <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> flame spread (speed of spread) were carried out. The results obtained have been compared with the results of flame retardant metaaramide yarns Nomex (DuPont, USA) and with results obtained earlier by co-author of present investigations [1, 2]. The investigation shows that even when the concentration is 4 times lower than basic, it provides similar flammability properties to the analogous properties of Nomex yarns. The differences between properties of various kinds of cellulose yarns were investigated as well. The best results <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> properties have been obtained for cotton yarns and the lowest - for flax yarns. The reason for these differences can be explained by composition of various kinds of cellulose fibres. The influence of concentration of flame retardant reagent on the strength of yarns was investigated too. The research shows, that oncentration has a negative influence on the strength of yarns – when concentration increases the strength decreases. The results of investigation show that concentration of flame retardant reagent can be used in much lower levels than is recommended by the producer. Also the lower level of concentration supports the higher strength of yarns. The lower concentration can be recommended for textile goods which are not necessary to wash...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{intumescent}} {{flame retardant}} treatment, obtained {{by a combination}} of vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) and methacrylamide (MAA), was applied to cotton fabrics. In order to improve the cross-linking degree onto cellulose polymers, potassium persulfate was used as initiator of a radical polymerization technique. The application on cotton was carried out by padding, followed by drying and a curing treatment. The treated samples were characterized by SEM, TGA and FTIR-ATR analyses and <b>tested</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>flammability</b> and washing fastness. The thermal and fire behavior of the treated fabrics was thoroughly investigated. The results clearly showed that the VPA/MAA coating was able to exert a protective action, giving rise to the formation of a stable char on the surface of textile fibers upon heating, hence improving the flame retardant performance of cotton. Horizontal flame spread tests confirmed that the coated fabrics achieved self-extinction, and the residues well preserved the original weave structure and fiber morphology; at variance, the uncoated fabric left only ashes. A remarkable weight loss was observed only after the first washing cycle, then the samples did not show any significant weight loss, hence confirming the durability of the self-extinguishing treatment, even after five laundering cycles...|$|R
