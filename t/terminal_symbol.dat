25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar {{can be transformed}} into an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton. The derivation process of the grammar is simulated in a leftmost way. Where the grammar rewrites a nonterminal, the PDA takes the topmost nonterminal from its stack and replaces it by the right-hand part of a grammatical rule (expand). Where the grammar generates a <b>terminal</b> <b>symbol,</b> the PDA reads a symbol from input when it is the topmost symbol on the stack (match). In a sense the stack of the PDA contains the unprocessed data of the grammar, corresponding to a pre-order traversal of a derivation tree.|$|E

5000|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>terminal</b> and nonterminal <b>symbols</b> are the lexical elements used in {{specifying the}} production rules constituting a formal grammar. <b>Terminal</b> <b>symbols</b> are the elementary {{symbols of the}} [...] language defined by a formal grammar.

40|$|When Genetic Programming (GP) {{is applied}} to rule {{extraction}} from databases, the attributes of the data are often used for the <b>terminal</b> <b>symbols.</b> However, {{in the case of}} the database with a large number of attributes, the search space becomes vast because the size of the terminal set increases. As a result, the search performance declines. For improving the search performance, we propose new methods for dealing with the large-scale terminal set. In the methods, the <b>terminal</b> <b>symbols</b> are clustered based on the similarities of the attributes. In the beginning of search, by reducing the number of <b>terminal</b> <b>symbols,</b> the rough and rapid search is performed. In the latter stage of search, by using the original attributes for <b>terminal</b> <b>symbols,</b> the local search is performed.

5000|$|The syntax {{of textual}} {{programming}} languages is usually defined {{using a combination}} of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backus-Naur form (for grammatical structure) to inductively specify syntactic categories (nonterminals) and <b>terminal</b> <b>symbols.</b> Syntactic categories are defined by rules called productions, which specify the values that belong to a particular syntactic category. <b>Terminal</b> <b>symbols</b> are the concrete characters or strings of characters (for example keywords such as define, if, let, or void) from which syntactically valid programs are constructed.|$|R

50|$|The grammar's <b>terminal</b> <b>symbols</b> are the multi-character symbols or 'tokens' {{found in}} the input stream by a lexical scanner.
