5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Glen, under the title In <b>the</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>shadowing</b> <b>of</b> sea quarks and gluons {{and show}} that <b>the</b> <b>shadowing</b> <b>of</b> gluons is not simply given by <b>the</b> sea quark <b>shadowing,</b> especially at small x. The calculations are done in the lab frame approach by using the generalized vector meson dominance model. Here the virtual photon turns into a hadronic fluctuation long before the nucleus. The subsequent coherent interaction {{with more than one}} nucleon in the nucleus leads to the depletion sigma(gamma* A) < A sigma(gamma*N) known as <b>shadowing.</b> A comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadowing</b> <b>of</b> quarks to E 665 data for 40 Ca and 207 Pb shows good agreement...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin {{was not interested}} in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: <b>The</b> <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Templars title.|$|E
