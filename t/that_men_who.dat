5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer fit to be soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I {{were all}} volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male {{settlers}} of fighting age {{were expected to}} abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many {{of them were in}} vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that conscription might be required if not enough joined up.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{of men in}} North America and Europe show <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> consume {{alcoholic}} drinks {{often do}} {{so in order to}} fulfill certain social expectations of manliness. While the causes of drinking and alcoholism are complex and varied, gender roles and social expectations have a strong influence encouraging men to drink.|$|E

25|$|Namie's {{study of}} {{workplace}} bullying found that 31% {{of women and}} 21% of men who reported workplace bullying exhibited three key symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (hypervigilance, intrusive imagery, and avoidance behaviours). A 1998 study of male college students (n = 70) by Simonelli & Ingram found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were emotionally abused by their female partners exhibited higher rates of chronic depression than the general population.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 five-city {{participatory}} community assessment by Colectivo Sol (a non-governmental organization) {{found that}} some HIV hospital patients had a sign over their beds stating they were HIV-positive. In León, Guanajuato, researchers found that 7 out of 10 people in the study had lost their jobs because of their HIV status. The same study also documented evidence of discrimination <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> {{have sex with men}} experienced within their families.|$|E
25|$|As {{time has}} passed, the sample has dwindled. As of 2003, {{there were over}} 200 members of the sample still alive. The study is to {{continue}} until the final member of the sample either withdraws or dies. In the 21st century researchers continue to publish articles based on the data collected in the Genetic Studies of Genius. For example, one article found <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> skipped a grade in childhood had higher incomes throughout adulthood, a finding that has been replicated in more modern samples.|$|E

25|$|To {{prevent the}} Chinese from {{following}} Mongolian and hence un-Confucian customs, the government decreed in 1330 <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> took their widowed stepmothers or sister-in-law as wives, {{in violation of}} their own community's customs, would be punished. In the mean time, to encourage the Mongols and the Muslims to follow the Chinese customs, the officials of these two ethnic groups were allowed in 1329 to observe the Chinese custom of three years of mourning for deceased parents. He supported Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself in Buddhism. He supervised {{the construction of the}} Stupa of Master Zhaozhou in the Buddhist Bailin Temple.|$|E
25|$|Confronted with riots {{threatening}} {{the lives of}} citizens and damaging their properties, the government took the decision to raise a special police force. On the morning of April 27, the authorities informed the population <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> would show up at 6:00pm {{in front of the}} dépôt de l'ordonnance on rue du Bord-de-l'Eau would receive arms. Some 800 men, principally Canadians from Montreal and its suburbs and some Irish immigrants of Griffintown, presented themselves and between 500 and 600 constables were armed and barracked near the Bonsecours Market. During the arms distribution, a group of men showed up and attacked the new constables by firing on them and throwing rocks at them. The newly armed men fought back and wounded three of their assailants.|$|E
25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do not see how such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E
500|$|Female {{smoking is}} a taboo in North Korea and is {{considered}} even more disgraceful than heavy drinking. Women are said to [...] "react with shock if you joke that maybe they secretly smoke in bathrooms". Smoking by older women, above the age of 45 to 50 is more tolerated, particularly in rural areas. In comparison, for men smoking is considered such an important social activity <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> do not smoke can become outsiders at workplaces.|$|E

500|$|In {{his closing}} argument, Coakley {{described}} a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker {{shortly after the}} explosion when {{two and a half}} companies were mixed together for two weeks. Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work and {{trying to get out of}} loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal. Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together. Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: [...] "Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny." [...] He gave his opinion <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> admitted in time of war that they were afraid to load ammunition were of a low moral character and were likely to give false testimony.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} book (ch. 52–57), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a {{classical}} utopia presented in order to critique and assess {{the state of the}} society of Rabelais's day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice. [...] It is a utopia where people's desires are more fulfilled. [...] Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais's fiction. [...] The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being [...] "Do What Thou Wilt". Rabelais believed <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> are free, well born and bred have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, because men desire what they are denied.|$|E
500|$|Between 1929 and 1937, {{the number}} of {{soldiers}} within the Militia who could provide effective service was well below the force's actual on paper strength as many soldiers were unable to attend even a six-day annual camp {{out of fear of}} losing their civilian employment. Also {{it has been estimated that}} up to 50 per cent of the Militia's other ranks were medically unfit. The numbers situation had become so tenuous that it was rare for a battalion to be able to field even 100 men during an exercise, so units accepted men that would not normally meet the medical requirements, indeed it has been stated <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were [...] "lame and practically blind" [...] were allowed to join in an effort to improve numbers. To illustrate this, in 1936, the largest battalion—the 30th/51st Battalion—had just 412 personnel of all ranks, while the 11th/16th Battalion, which was the smallest, had only 156 men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Believe what, sir?" [...] said she, and {{the lawyer}} could {{immediately}} perceive {{that she did}} believe and probably knew <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had called himself Talbot was still alive.|$|R

500|$|Webster's {{behaviour}} {{in court}} and her sexual history also counted against her. She was widely described by reporters as [...] "calm" [...] and [...] "stolid" [...] in facing the court and only cried once during the trial, when her son was mentioned. This contradicted the expectation that [...] "properly feminine" [...] women should be penitent and emotional in such a situation. Her succession of male friends, one of whom had fathered her child outside wedlock, suggested promiscuous female sexuality—again, strongly counter to expected norms of behaviour. During her trial she attempted unsuccessfully to evoke sympathy by blaming Strong, the possible father of her child, for leading her astray: [...] "I formed an intimate acquaintance with one who should have protected me and was led away by evil associates and bad companions." [...] This claim played on social expectations that women's moral sense was inextricably linked with sexual chastity—"falling" [...] sexually would lead {{to other forms of}} [...] "ruin"—and <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had sexual relations with women acquired social obligations that they were expected to fulfil. Webster's attempt to implicate three innocent men also caused outrage; O'Donnell commented that [...] "public opinion, as a whole, undoubtedly condemned Kate Webster, as much, perhaps, for her attempts to bring three innocent men to the scaffold as for the actual murder itself".|$|E
500|$|There {{was already}} a [...] "Great Barn" [...] on the site, and as early as 1110 a manor record shows <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were not wanted for {{ploughing}} were required to [...] "thresh in the Great Barn until sunset". A granary was recorded in a survey conducted in 1293–4 and a further survey of 1324 recorded {{the existence of a}} monastic grange in addition to the granary. The wheat barn at Harmondsworth was damaged in a storm in 1398 and records from Winchester College show that two carpenters were sent to make repairs, for which a large quantity of tiles, nails and other roofing materials was purchased. By this time, however, the existing barn was evidently becoming inadequate. The college's records indicate that in 1426–7 it commissioned two men, William Kypping (or Kipping) and John atte Oke, to obtain timbers from Kingston upon Thames to use for a new barn at Harmondsworth. This date matches an early fifteenth-century origin for the Great Barn's timbers, which has been established through dendrochronology. The architect is not known, but it is possible that William Wyse may have been involved. He was the main carpenter for New College, Oxford and the master carpenter at Windsor Castle in 1430, and worked on repairing the aisles at the church of St Mary's in Harmondsworth, practically next door to the manor. Carpenters from Ickenham and Uxbridge were also involved and a tiler appears to have been employed by the college at the same time. Once completed, the barn would have been used to thresh and store grain from the manor farm.|$|E
