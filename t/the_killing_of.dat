5|$|The Waterloo Bay {{massacre}} or Elliston massacre {{refers to}} a fatal clash between settlers and Aboriginal Australians in late May 1849 on the cliffs of Waterloo Bay near Elliston, South Australia {{which led to the}} deaths of a number of Aboriginal people, and forms part of the Australian frontier wars. The events leading up to the fatal clash included killings of three white settlers by Aboriginal people, and <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> one Aboriginal person and the death by poisoning of five others by white settlers. The limited archival records indicate that three Aboriginal people were killed or died of wounds from the clash, and five were captured, however, accounts of <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> up to 260 Aboriginal people at the cliffs have persistently circulated since at least 1880.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal status}} and rights of Roman slaves {{also began to}} change.

Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for <b>the</b> <b>killing</b> <b>of</b> slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown {{that they were being}} mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be direct results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.|$|E
