5|$|After the merger, {{the company}} began working on Enclave, a medieval fantasy, multiplayer-only video game {{inspired}} by Team Fortress. The game also became the company's first project with international appeal, enabling Starbreeze <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> various publishers including Swing Entertainment, Conspiracy Entertainment, and Vivendi. However, Swing Entertainment faced bankruptcy at that time, and decided to turn the game into a single-player action-adventure video game {{with the goal of}} sending it to market as soon as possible. The game was released in 2002, and Starbreeze had to lay off staff after its release. Enclave II was also in development. The sequel was said to feature a more elaborate story, 28 different maps, 10 playable characters, and an improved fighting system. However, these features were axed when Starbreeze got into legal troubles with the publisher, resulting in the game's cancellation. Another game, , was successfully released with help from publisher TDK Mediactive. However its sequel was shifted to another developer. Starbreeze attempted to acquire another studio, Rock Solid Games, but the agreement between the two fell apart and brought both companies financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision for the government <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} {{to search for a}} {{publisher}} for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but he was convinced by Ed Fries <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> the newly established Microsoft Game Studios. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, and for MacOS on May 2, 2003 by Destineer.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Microsoft Studios {{launched}} Halo Wars, a real-time strategy spin-off to {{the first-person}} shooter video game series Halo. The game {{was developed by}} Microsoft subsidiary Ensemble Studios. While Halo Wars was a commercial success, Ensemble Studios was shut down upon completion of its development. Prior to its closure, Ensemble had started writing a script and laying the narrative groundwork for a sequel. According to Halo Wars lead writer Graeme Devine, this original script explored {{the history of the}} Forerunners and involved the Spirit of Fire arriving at a Forerunner station that Anders had tracked. In 2007, Microsoft formed an internal division named 343 Industries to oversee and develop products in the Halo franchise. While the division had intentions of creating a follow-up to Halo Wars, they refrained from doing so until they found the right developer <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> on the project. They viewed working with other developers and using external experience as a significant part of maintaining quality across their numerous projects.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{dissolution}} of the Filipino Premier League, the Football Alliance sought to renew the interest of Filipinos in football. The Alliance entered into discussions with the United Football Clubs Association for the possibility of establishing another top-flight football competition in the Philippines. Instead of creating a whole system and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> the Football Alliance in operating the United Football League (UFL), a semi-professional league. After the league's second season, AKTV became its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a ₱150 million (~$3.3 million or ~€2.5 million), five-year deal, which ensures the airing of two live matches every week. The deal was further improved with a new TV arrangement in which four live matches would be aired every week on primetime television on AksyonTV.|$|E

5|$|Larry Schmittou had {{originally}} been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple-A team, {{but he refused to}} go back on his previous promise <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished {{the first half of the}} season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, the league MVP, led the league with 101runs, 34home runs, 122RBI, and 288total bases. Pitcher Andy McGaffigan was selected as the league's top pitcher. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676fans visited Greer Stadium. This record still stands as of the completion of the 2016 season. Their 97–46 record is the franchise's all-time best. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.|$|E
5|$|With {{a payroll}} of 6,632 at March 1990, the airline had {{a fleet of}} three Airbus A310-200s, three Boeing 707-320Cs, eight Boeing 737-200s and two DC-10-30s. A large {{domestic}} network serving the 19 Nigerian states was operated, as well as routes to East and West Africa; intercontinental flights from Lagos to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London, New York and Rome, from Kano to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London and Rome, and from Port Harcourt to London were also undertaken. The carrier suffered a major accident on 11 July 1991, when all 261 people on board a Douglas DC-8-61, registration C-GMXQ, crashed near Jeddah. In 1992, Nigeria Airways had three Boeing 707s impounded in Europe, {{and the number of}} flights experienced a 32% reduction following the termination of services to Conakry, Freetown and Robertsfield (Monrovia). Privatisation was first considered in 1993 with a proposal to split Nigeria Airways in two companies, one bearing the same name and operating domestic routes and a new one named Air Nigeria, which would undertake the international operations. In July 1994, an Airbus was impounded at London Heathrow Airport owing to a debt worth ₤100,000. On 21 December of the same year, a Boeing 707, registration 5N-ABK, crashed near Hadejia on a freighter flight from Jeddah, killing three of a crew of five. Further staff reductions continued throughout {{the first half of the}} 1990s, and at September 1995 the airline had 4,500 employees. In 1997 the UK Civil Aviation Authority banned the airline from operating into its territory citing safety concerns; in return, the Nigerian government barred British Airways from operating in the country. The service was restored in 1998 when the carrier began codesharing with British Airways, deploying a leased Boeng 747-200 that wore a Nigeria Airways livery and was operated on the Lagos–London Heathrow route with mixed English and Nigerian crews. By the late 1990s, the Nigerian government decided the carrier would be privatised by selling 40% and 20% to foreign and local investors, respectively, and keeping the rest of the shares. In 1999, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was commissioned by the Nigerian government to assist in the process of restructuring and privatisation of the airline. Among three options, one of them was <b>to</b> <b>partner</b> <b>with</b> a large European airline; Air France, British Airways, German-based Lufthansa, Swissair and the British carrier Virgin were all considered. Another alternative was to liquidate the carrier.|$|E
