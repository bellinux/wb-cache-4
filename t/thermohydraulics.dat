The two key objectives of the CRP were to establish accurate databases on the <b>thermohydraulics</b> of supercritical pressure fluids and to test analysis methods for SCWR thermohydraulic behaviour to identify code development needs. In total, 16 institutes from nine Member States and two international organizations were involved in the CRP. The <b>thermohydraulics</b> phenomena investigated in the CRP included heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics of supercritical pressure fluids, development of new heat transfer prediction methods, critical flow during depressurization from supercritical conditions, flow stability and natural circulation in supercritical pressure systems. Two code testing benchmark exercises were performed for steady state heat transfer and flow stability in a heated channel. The CRP was completed with the planned outputs in 2012.

While the fluid flow and heat transfer in wavy microchannels {{have been studied}} extensively in a numerical fashion, experimental studies are very limited due to the technical difficulties of making accurate measurements in micro-scale flows. This thesis provides insights into <b>thermohydraulics</b> of tortuous microchannels by developing experimental techniques and performing systematic visualisation and heat transfer experiments. The detailed flow patterns (including Dean vortices) and transition behaviours in wavy channels are successfully identified using Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) and 3 D reconstruction techniques. Conjugate heat transfer simulations are carried out to understand the complex thermal behaviour present in the current experimental design and to validate and compare with experimental results. The impact of tortuous geometry on flow and heat transfer in microchannels is studied systematically.

It is a very active research field due to {{the increasing number of}} applications in the <b>thermohydraulics</b> of heat exchangers, nuclear plants, chemical processes and oil industries. This paper presents the local measurements in a vertical upward air-water flow using the electrical resistivity double probe technique. The test section was a 80 mm i. d. and 160 cm long Plexiglas pipe. Five different gas superficial velocities, ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 10 m/s, were used in combination with two liquid superficial velocities of 0 and 0. 10 m/s. A resistivity double probe was employed for measurements of the radial profiles of void fraction, bubble frequency, bubble interface velocity, interfacial area concentration and Sauter mean diameter. The electrical resistivity probe method consists of a instantaneous measurement of the local electrical resistivity in the two-phase flow by means of a sensor electrode. Since the circuit is opened or closed depending on whether the sensor tip is in contact with gas or liquid, the probe behaves in principle like a switch, yielding a two-stage signal. However, to obtain a true square wave type signals, a proper threshold voltage has {{to be used as a}} triggering criterion. Herein the signal conditioning is discussed and the influence of the threshold level is analyzed. With a probe with two sensors displaced axially, the bubble interface velocity could be determined from the time delay which gave maximum correlation between the sensor responses. These values of gas velocity in conjunction with void fractions could be integrated to give average gas superficial velocities. Values determined in this manner were compared to values from the inlet gas flowrate measurements and showed an average deviation of less than 6 % for bubbly flow...|$|E
