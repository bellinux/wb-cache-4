5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} since <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> of the 21st century, {{the press is}} corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> of the 21st century and are largely unregulated.|$|E

30|$|Compared to the Max C scenario, {{maximization}} of discounted {{carbon balance}} led to decreased cutting levels during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> (Fig. 4, bottom). This is logical because the carbon balance of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> had more importance, {{and the best}} way to improve the carbon balance of near future was to decrease cuttings. However, a less obvious result was that decreased cuttings during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> were not compensated for by increased cuttings during later periods.|$|R

5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England {{before the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decade</b> of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
