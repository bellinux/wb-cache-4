They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of <b>the</b> <b>inning,</b> but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him.

Giants' starter Jack Sanford then reached based on a throwing error by Drysdale, which also allowed Haller to score and advanced Pagán to third base. Chuck Hiller and Jim Davenport followed this with successive singles which scored Pagán and Sanford respectively. This made the score 4–0 in favor of the Giants with Hiller on second and Sanford on first, still with only one out in <b>the</b> <b>inning.</b> Ed Roebuck entered in relief of Drysdale, inducing an out at second base on a groundball by Willie Mays, to leave runners at the corners with two outs.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{central nervous}} system (CNS), the Na(+) -Ca(2 +) {{exchanger}} plays a fundamental role <b>in</b> controlling <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intracellular concentrations of Na(+) and Ca(2 +) ions. These cations are known to regulate neurotransmitter release, cell migration and differentiation, gene expression, and neurodegenerative processes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, nonradioactive in situ hybridization and light immunohistochemistry were carried out to map the regional and cellular distribution for both transcripts and proteins encoded by the three known Na(+) -Ca(2 +) exchanger genes NCX 1, NCX 2, and NCX 3.

NCX 3 mRNAs were mainly detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hippocampus, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thalamus, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amygdala, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cerebellum.
