As darkness approached, the plane was almost out of fuel and the crew was aware {{that it would not be}} able to find its way back to Campo Uno. As the plane possessed a 100 m <b>trailing</b> <b>antenna,</b> which it could unfold if needed, it released the aerial and sent an SOS; however, no reply was received. Eventually, the plane had to make an emergency landing. Bohnsack was able to land the plane without damage and the crew attempted to contact the Luftwaffe headquarters at Agedabia at the arranged time, without success.

At , the balloon envelope was the largest that had ever been successfully launched, expanding to 300 ft in diameter when fully inflated. Beneath the balloon hung a large parachute and then the gondola. Winzen Research designed a unique gondola for the flight. To control temperature, the gondola was protected by special venetian blinds, but otherwise open to space. The venetian blinds had light and dark sides. The light side could be turned outwards to cool the cabin while the dark side could be turned outward to warm the cabin.

40|$|Keywords:Trailing antenna,Steady state,The end radius,Verticality Abstract: To {{send the}} very low {{frequency}} signals, the length of antenna must attend one-half of a wavelength, maybe more than 8, 000 meters sometimes.

50|$|The E-6 {{aircraft}} {{is based}} on the Boeing 707. The wings were redesigned to meet new wing loading characteristics, the tail was redesigned after a catastrophic failure of the vertical stabilizer during flight tests.

Larger fuel tanks were installed and the fuselage was extensively modified to accommodate the 31 <b>antennas,</b> including the <b>trailing</b> wire <b>antenna</b> and reel assembly. After the upgrade to the E-6B, the TACAMO aircraft - with the addition of an Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) - took over the EC-135 Looking Glass mission formerly conducted by the USAF 55th Wing at Offutt AFB, Nebraska.|$|R

5000|$|Each ARIA {{aircraft}} {{had both}} {{external and internal}} modifications. Externally the most obvious difference in appearance from a standard C-135 or C-18 aircraft was the large, bulbous, [...] "droop snoot" [...] nose, a ten-foot radome which houses a seven-foot steerable dish antenna. The ARIA also has a probe antenna on each wing tip and a <b>trailing</b> wire <b>antenna</b> {{on the bottom of}} the fuselage (EC-l35E only) used for high frequency (HF) radio transmission and reception. Further external modifications include antennas for data retransmission via UHF satellite. The internal modifications to the cargo compartment included all of the instrumentation subsystems (Prime Mission Electronic Equipment - PMEE) installed in the form of a 30,000 pound modular package. Also provided are facilities for the crew members who operate the PMEE. The Prime Mission Electronic Equipment (PMEE) is organized into eight functional subsystems to provide the ARIA mission support capability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Dead {{reckoning}} {{represents a}} class of meth-ods for relative position estimation based on a previously determined absolute reference position. The estimate is formulated {{from a combination of}} the known speed, time and heading information with the known reference posi-tion. One of the main obstacles to effective positioning of pedestrians via dead reckoning is the lack of accurate speed estimation algorithms. Existing methods are either complex or provide results that are unsatisfactory at the low velocities associated with pedestrians. In contrast, the two algorithms proposed in this paper are relatively simple to implement and provide accurate results at low velocities. In the first algorithm, a one-dimensional and unidirectional two-antenna solution is described where the speed can be easily estimated from a knowledge of the fixed inter-antenna distance and the time it takes for the <b>trailing</b> <b>antenna</b> to sense the same channel conditions (radio frequency (RF) signature) previously observed at the leading antenna. Com-puter simulations show that, with typical estimation errors of less than 2. 67 % around average pedestrian speeds, the approach is indeed effective and accurate. A by-product of the algorithm is an environment specific spatial correlation function which is used in the second algorithm to provide even better estimates. With the improvements offered by the latter algorithm, relative errors of merely around 0. 15 % on average are achievable. This improvement in performance over the first algorithm comes at the cost of slightly higher computational complexity. When subsequently used for user displacement estimation, a relatively small error of 24. 5 cm is observed after a duration of 60 s.

40|$|Although {{the primary}} purpose of the signal {{received}} by amobile handset or smartphone is to enable wireless communication, the information extracted can be reused to provide a number of additional services. Two such services discussed in this thesis are: mobile speed estimation and signal anomaly detection. The proposed algorithms exploit the propagation environment specific information that is already imprinted on the received signal and therefore do not incur any additional signalling overhead. Speed estimation is useful for providing navigation and location based services in areas where global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) based devices are unusable while the proposed anomaly detection algorithms can be used to locate signal faults and aid spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems. The speed estimation algorithms described within this thesis require a receiver with at least two antenna elements and a wideband radio frequency (RF) signal source. The channel transfer function observed at the antenna elements are compared to yield an estimate of the device speed. The basic algorithm is a one-dimensional and unidirectional two-antenna solution. The speed of the mobile receiver is estimated from a knowledge of the fixed inter-antenna distance and the time it takes for the <b>trailing</b> <b>antenna</b> to sense similar channel conditions previously observed at the leading antenna. A by-product of the algorithm is an environment specific spatial correlation function which may be combined with theoretical models of spatial correlation to extend and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Results obtained via computer simulations are provided. The anomaly detection algorithms proposed in this thesis highlight unusual signal features while ignoring events that are nominal. When the test signal possesses a periodic frame structure, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) analysis is employed to statistically compare successive signal frames. A method of automatically extracting the required frame period information from the signal is also provided. When the signal under test lacks a periodic frame structure, information content analysis of signal events can be used instead. Clean training data is required by this algorithm to initialise the reference event probabilities. In addition to the results obtained from extensive computer simulations, an architecture for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based hardware implementations of the KLD based algorithm is provided. Results showing the performance of the algorithms against real test signals captured over the air are also presented. Both sets of algorithms are simple, effective and have low computational complexity – implying that real-time implementations on platforms with limited processing power and energy are feasible. This is an important quality since location based services are expected to be an integral part of next generation cognitive radio handsets.

40|$|Studying {{biological}} {{rhythms of}} activity and determining the external {{factors that influence}} behaviour of animals can be challenging in many aquatic habitats. We investigated the validity of using variations in radio-signal strength to quantify changes in activity of radio-tagged aquatic fauna on a small spatial scale under controlled conditions in the field. We monitored short-term activity (< 1 min) of two aquatic species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Murray River crayfish (Euastacus armatus), that differ markedly in their primary mode of movement. Simultaneous video monitoring confirmed that active and inactive periods for both species could be accurately determined by radio-telemetry, as were specific behaviours exhibited by trout. We were also able to quantify activity based on different radio-tag (coil and <b>trailing</b> whip <b>antennas)</b> and receiving antenna configurations (yagi and gap-loop antennas); however, we recommend use of control tags to provide reference data. Variation in radio-signal strength represents a valid means of monitoring activity of moderately site-attached aquatic species. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Engineers' Air Battalion had pioneered {{experiments}} with wireless telegraphy in airships and aircraft before the RFC was created. Unfortunately the early transmitters weighed 75 pounds and filled {{a seat in}} the cockpit. This meant that the pilot had to fly the aircraft, navigate, observe the fall of the shells and transmit the results by morse code by himself. Also, the wireless in the aircraft could not receive. Originally only a special Wireless Flight attached to No. 4 Squadron RFC had the wireless equipment. Eventually this flight was expanded into No. 9 Squadron under Major Hugh Dowding. However, in early 1915 the Sterling lightweight wireless became available and was widely used. In 1915 each corps in the BEF was assigned a RFC squadron solely for artillery observation and reconnaissance duties. The transmitter filled the cockpit normally used by the observer and a <b>trailing</b> wire <b>antenna</b> was used which had to be reeled in prior to landing.|$|R

The large angle-of-attack range of the trailing wire required two different model configurations. The first configuration, using full-scale wire lengths suspended between steel stanchions, was mounted on a flush four-degree-of-freedom wall balance. The second configuration, used a 15 -scale grooved cylinder model with an ogive nose mounted on a six-degree-of-freedom sting balance. Wall balance wire data, valid for higher angles of attack, were integrated with low angle-of-attack sting balance data. Empirical relationships for the normal and axial force coefficients were verified with historical references for tested clean circular cylinders and extended for the grooved configurations. Existence of a side force coefficient due to circulation caused by the helical grooves was discovered, expressed analytically, and verified with flow-visualization techniques. Finally, the experimental coefficients were used to improve an existing simulation model describing the static equilibrium conditions of a cable towed. by an airplane in a circular orbit. Inclusion of the side force influence in the static model proved consistent with the lateral skew angle and direction observed during flight test. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} an extensive evaluation of Loran-C {{for use by}} general aviation. Flight, ground, and antenna tests were done. Flight tests measured the accuracy {{and the ability to}} make approaches. Receiver reliability and susceptibility to atmospheric noise were also studied. Ground tests looked into grid stability and grid war page. Antenna tests were done to evaluate three antenna configurations [...] ADF, vertical whip, and <b>trailing</b> wire <b>antennas.</b> The measured accuracy met FAA AC 90 - 45 A requirements for all phases of flight. Loran-C was found to be satisfactory for approaches within AC 90 - 45 A specifications. Reliability was 99. 7 %, the receiver was insensitive to atmospheric noise. The time difference grid was stable in the long run. Antenna tests showed the ADF and vertical whip antennas to be suitable for airborne use. It is concluded that Loran-C is suitable for navigation as an alternative to VHF RNAV. This navigation system is suitable for use in general aviation aircraft.

Unarmed, even without radios, their survival was totally dependent on their individual ability to deceive enemy officers they were sent out to approach. These female agents proved remarkably effective. Once near the lines they would allow themselves to be captured by Allied forces. From detention camps, a pre-arranged signal from them would lead to their release and immediate debriefing of intelligence gathered during their mission. Approximately 1,000 Rabbits were dropped into enemy territory between September 1950 and June 1951. Amazingly, more than 70 percent returned to friendly territory, providing key intelligence into North Korean activities.|$|R
