5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
40|$|WO 2008014915 A 2 UPAB: 20080226 NOVELTY - The plasma {{treatment}} of a surface of an object such as plug or a micro titre plate in a hollow body (4) for changing its surface properties, comprises filling <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body with a process gas, gas tightly sealing <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body, introducing <b>the</b> sealed <b>hollow</b> body in a space (5) between two electrodes (1, 2), and igniting plasma in an inner chamber of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body by applying a sufficiently high alternating voltage between <b>the</b> electrodes. <b>The</b> <b>hollow</b> body has a wall from dielectric material. The plasma is produced in the interior area of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{plasma treatment}} of a surface of an object such as plug or a micro titre plate in a hollow body (4) for changing its surface properties, comprises filling <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body with a process gas, gas tightly sealing <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body, introducing <b>the</b> sealed <b>hollow</b> body in a space (5) between two electrodes (1, 2), and igniting plasma in an inner chamber of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body by applying a sufficiently high alternating voltage between <b>the</b> electrodes. <b>The</b> <b>hollow</b> body has a wall from dielectric material. The plasma is produced in the interior area of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. Atmospheric pressure prevails in the space while an internal pressure prevails in an inner chamber of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. <b>The</b> gas at the atmospheric pressure has higher ignition voltage than the process gas at the internal pressure. The internal pressure {{is similar to the}} atmospheric pressure or is less than 1 bar over the atmospheric pressure. A bag, a bottle and/or a canister are used as <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. <b>The</b> wall thickness and diameter of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body are 50 microns to 2 mm and 6 cm respectively. The plasma is produced as a volume plasma (6), which extends itself from a wall of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body to opposite wall of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. <b>The</b> alternating voltage has amplitude of 1 - 20 kV. A power of 100 W to 5 kW is supplied for producing the plasma. A part of the surface to be treated is brought in contact with the plasma for 5 - 300 seconds. Pencil and plate, pencils and/or two plates act as electrodes, which are directly placed on <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. <b>The</b> electrodes are moved while igniting the plasma. The process gas is added to a precursor, which encloses the process gas. The process gas is supplied before filling <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body through <b>the</b> precursor. The internal wall surface of <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body is coated and/or functionalized. The outside area of the object brought in <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body is treated before sealing <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body. <b>The</b> object is moved by shaking <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> body while its outside area is treated with the plasma. USE - Plasma {{treatment of a}} surface of an object such as plug or micro titre plate in a hollow body (claimed) for changing its surface properties. ADVANTAGE - The procedure reduces process steps, thus ensuring simple procedure, and ensures economical treatment of the surface of abject with desired surface properties...|$|R

When threatened, a wildcat with a den will retreat into it, rather than climb trees. When taking residence in a tree hollow, the wildcat selects one low to the ground. Dens in rocks or burrows are lined with dry grasses and bird feathers. Dens in tree hollows usually contain enough sawdust to make lining unnecessary. During flea infestations, the wildcat leaves its den in favour of another. During winter, when snowfall prevents the wildcat from travelling long distances, it remains within its den more than usual.|$|E

25|$|The {{area was}} {{historically}} inhabited by the Taungurong people. They knew the Yea River as Caluther, and the Goulburn River as Warring. Shortly after {{the time of}} white settlement their numbers in the area were estimated at 500-600, but before this their numbers had already declined severely due to disease, {{and the destruction of}} their traditional hunting grounds by introduced stock and other European encroachment saw their numbers rapidly decrease. The first Europeans in the area were a party of explorers led by William Hovell and Hamilton Hume, who crossed the Goulburn River at a point near Molesworth in December 1824, and crossed the stream they named Muddy Creek the following day. (The Muddy Creek was renamed the Yea River in 1879.)

25|$|The {{ground between}} the Carthaginian and Roman camps was flat, {{treeless}} and barren, {{with a low}} ridge sitting midway between the camps. There were hollows and dead patches {{of land in the}} ground behind and beside the hill where soldiers could hide without being noticed. Hannibal selected a picked body of 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry, and ordered them to conceal themselves in groups of 200-300 in <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> and dead ground on the night before the battle. The skill and discipline of the Carthaginians is evident through their flawless execution of this potentially hazardous operation. At dawn, a contingent of Carthaginian light infantry took position on the hill {{in full view of the}} Romans. From their vantage point, the Carthaginians on the hill could spy on the Romans, just like the spearmen guard Minucius had dislodged from another hill prior to the start of the skirmish. Unlike the previous encounter, this time Hannibal was fully prepared for the Roman response.|$|E

Hannibal and his infantry struck the now unbalanced Romans from the front before {{the shock of the}} ambush faded or Minucius could take corrective action. Attacked from all sides, some of the Romans broke ranks and fled, while the others became surrounded and were fighting for their lives. A disaster for Rome again loomed, and barring divine intervention, only the actions of a general known for his avoidance of battle could have saved the army of Minucius from certain destruction.|$|E

25|$|Captive bred Spix's macaws reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{seven years of}} age. A paired female born at the Loro Parque Fundación laid eggs {{at the age of}} five years, but these were infertile. It is suspected that late maturity in captivity may be due to inbreeding or other artificial environmental factors, as other parrots of similar size reach {{sexual maturity}} in two to four years. In the wild, mating involves elaborate courtship rituals, like feeding each other and flying together. This process is known to possibly take several seasons in other large parrots, and it may also be the case for the Spix's. They make their nests in <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> of large mature Caraibeira trees, and reuse the nest year after year. The breeding season is November to March, with most eggs hatching in January to coincide with the start of the Caatinga January to April rainy season. In the wild, Spix's were believed to lay three eggs per clutch; in captivity, the average number is four eggs, and can range from one to seven. Incubation period is 25–28 days and only the female performs incubation duties. The chicks fledge in 70 days and are independent in 100–130 days.|$|E
