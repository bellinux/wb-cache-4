5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group.

Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

25|$|Realising {{that she}} and K-9 are {{effectively}} on their own, she tries {{to figure out how}} to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the when of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property.

25|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. Conditions were cloudy and blustery for the Friday practice sessions with heavy rain hitting the circuit before the day's running ended, preventing drivers from recording faster lap times. Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the first session after forty-five minutes {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 23.619 seconds, almost eight-tenths of a second faster than his team-mate Barrichello in second. The two McLaren drivers were third and fourth with Häkkinen ahead of Coulthard. Frentzen (with a lap of 1:25.234) was fifth fastest, ahead of Irvine and Panis. Villeneuve, Jarno Trulli and Räikkönen (despite spinning at the Abbey chicane) rounded out the top ten fastest drivers of the session. Montoya (who set the thirteenth quickest time) spun at Vale corner after pushing hard with ten minutes remaining in the session but continued, and his Williams team-mate Ralf Schumacher lost the rear-end of his car at the exit of Bridge corner and managed to continue. In the second practice session, Häkkinen set the fastest time of the day with a lap of 1:22.827; Coulthard finished with the second-fastest time which was half a second off his team-mate's pace. Both Ferrari drivers were third and fourth fastest with Barrichello ahead of Michael Schumacher. Frentzen's car developed an oil leak {{at the start of the}} session but duplicated his first-session result in fifth. Heidfeld was sixth, with Pedro de la Rosa seventh fastest. Ralf Schumacher, Trulli and Räikkönen followed in the top ten. Fernando Alonso damaged the under tray of his Minardi after he found it difficult <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> Copse corner and drove back to his garage.|$|E

500|$|Although the C5 reached {{retail stores}} {{at the start}} of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of {{teenagers}} <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of £20 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told The Times that [...] "we haven't done... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off." [...] Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for [...] "a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting". Matters did not improve. The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.|$|E

500|$|Following the storm, the Northern Territory {{government}} {{declared a}} state of emergency for the hardest hit areas. It provided financial assistance to families affected by the storm, totaling $1,245 (AUD) for each family. The government sent a Royal Australian Air Force plane with emergency supplies to Darwin after a request from the Northern Territory. Officials sent crews to Elcho Island to help clear debris and restore power. Residents in Ramingining were under a boil-water advisory following the storm. A crew of 15volunteers flew from Alice Springs and Maningrida to help emergency workers. An online crowdfunding group raised over $12,000 (AUD) within one day to provide emergency supplies. Emergency officials also advised residents not <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> disaster areas for [...] "sightseeing" [...] due to the potential to disrupt repairs. A water and power worker estimated the power lines would be restored within one week, although that was dependent on internal building damage or tree removal. Following the storm, many residents returned to their damaged homes and lived instead in tents. The Northern Territory government established a tent city on the offshore Elcho Island, which was dismantled on March20 due to the threat of approaching Cyclone Nathan.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{new type}} of barrier is being tested in Michigan that is hoped will {{reduce the number of}} times drivers attempt <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> lowered {{crossing}} gates.

The delineators are designed so {{that they will not be}} broken and will not damage vehicles if they are hit, allowing vehicles to exit the level crossing if they are already within it when the gates are activated. The test period for the new barrier began on 5 December 2007, and ran for at least a period of 17 months.|$|E

[...] Using exactly the same ramp design, movie artists made the ramps convincingly look like a rickety old bridge that was falling apart. [...] The movie's director ruined the continuous spiral effect of the stunt. [...] By cutting camera shots as the car was in mid-air, it looks like trick photography to get the car upside-down instead of one continuous actual jump.|$|E
2500|$|This {{will usually}} mean that turning traffic {{will have to}} stop in order {{to wait for a}} breach to turn, and this might cause {{inconvenience}} for drivers that follow them but do not want to turn. This is why dedicated lanes and protected traffic signals for turning are sometimes provided. On busier intersections where a protected lane would be ineffective or cannot be built, turning may be entirely prohibited, and drivers will be required to [...] "drive around the block" [...] in order to accomplish the turn. Many cities employ this tactic quite often; in San Francisco, due to its common practice, making three right turns is known colloquially as a [...] "San Francisco left turn". Likewise, as many intersections in Taipei City are too busy to allow direct left turns, signs often direct drivers <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> the block to turn.|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} February, it was {{reported}} that the Gaddafi government had suppressed protests in Tripoli by distributing automobiles, money and weapons for hired followers <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>around</b> Tripoli and attack people showing signs of dissent.

The International Federation for Human Rights concluded on 24 February that Gaddafi was implementing a scorched earth strategy. The organization stated that [...] "It is reasonable to fear that he has, in fact, decided to largely eliminate, wherever he still can, Libyan citizens who stood up against his regime and furthermore, to systematically and indiscriminately repress civilians. These acts can be characterized as crimes against humanity, as defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court." ...|$|E
