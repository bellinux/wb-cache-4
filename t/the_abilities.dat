40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the theory of history {{education}} in Italy, especially the theory of Antonio Brusa's, a researcher of history education. In 1991 Brusa proposed three basic abilities of history education, namely, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of time, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of laboratorio (laboratory) and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to reason. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> of time is <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to recognize a change of history. The content of history education is determined by this <b>ability.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> of laboratorio says "grammars of history", which in other words, is composed of understanding concepts of document, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to select materials, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to question and interpret materials, and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to use information restored. "Grammars of history" make students evaluate new knowledge of history which they will meet {{in the future and}} alone will product alternative history. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> to reason makes students deal with history. These three abilities are consistent on his theory of history education...|$|R

The Correlation between <b>the</b> <b>Ability</b> of Reading Comprehension, Language Attitude and <b>the</b> <b>Ability</b> of Short Story Appreciation at Elementary School Students In Gugus Yudistira, Selogiri Wonogiri. Thesis: Surakarta: Indonesian Education Study Program, Post Graduate Program, Sebelas Maret University. June 2009. This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine the correlation between (1) <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation, (2) language attitude and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation, and (3) both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension and language attitude together and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation. The research was carried out at elementary schools in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri, from January to June 2009. The research method used was descriptive of correlational. The population of the research were the elementary school students in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri. The sample consisted of 120 students who were taken by using simple random sampling. The instruments used for data collection were: test for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension, test for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation; and questionary for language attitude. The technique used for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation. The result of the study shows that: (1) {{there is a positive}} correlation between <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation (r y 1 =. 87 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18); (2) there is a positive correlation between language attitude and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation (r y 2 =. 78 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18; (3) there is a positive correlation between both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension and language attitude together and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation (R y. 12 =. 86 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18). The above results show that both <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension and language attitude simultaneously give significant contribution to <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation. It means that both variables could be good predictors for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation. The analysis also indicates that the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation is stronger than that language attitude and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation. It means that <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension be considered a better predictor for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of short story appreciation than language attitude. Consequently, the teacher should pay more attention to <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of reading comprehension than the other aspect [...] - language attitude [...] - in improving short story appreciation class...|$|R

5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E

Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s birdseye perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{population}} of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals, a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s, and {{the disappearance of the}} species from Isla Recalada in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are World Heritage Sites for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density.|$|E

Having been impressed by <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium, he sent ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe. This mission was deftly accomplished– at the Council of Piacenza in 1095, Pope Urban II was impressed by Alexios's appeal for help, which spoke of the suffering of the Christians of the east and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches. Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside. Alexios's appeal offered a means not only to redirect the energy of the knights to benefit the Church, but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over all Christendom and to gain the east for the See of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Development {{plans for}} Kingdom Hearts II began around the {{completion}} of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, but specific details were undecided until July 2003. Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One such obstacle was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more, which required Disney's approval. The game was developed by Square Enix's Product Development Division-1, {{with most of the}} original staff from the first game. The game was originally supposed to have been released after Kingdom Hearts. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed.
