5|$|A more {{indirect}} consequence {{arose from}} the disagreements that occurred between Madero and his generals Villa and Orozco. The tensions began during the battle and continued afterward. In addition to the insubordination that the two leaders showed Madero while the fighting was still ongoing, they also clashed with him afterwards over payments to their soldiers and over the appointment of Venustiano Carranza as Madero's defence minister. Carranza was a civilian who had joined the revolution at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> for these reasons was despised by Orozco.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} of the sinking is unclear, due {{to a number of}} factors, including confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.|$|E

5|$|The first updated Mk. V sets {{arrived in}} April 1942 and were fitted to the de Havilland Mosquito as they became available. A Mk. V {{equipped}} Mosquito claimed its first kill on 24/25 June, when a Mosquito NF.II from No. 151 Squadron shot down a Dornier Do 217E-4 over the North Sea. In practice {{it was found}} that pilots had considerable difficulty looking up from the display at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> the system was used only experimentally. By this time the microwave units had started to arrive in small numbers, so Mk. V production was repeatedly delayed pending their arrival, and eventually cancelled.|$|E

5|$|For the 2008–09 season, the Devils signed Brian Rolston and Bobby Holik, both {{making their}} second stints with the team.

After his return, Brodeur broke Patrick Roy's record for regular season wins on March 17, 2009, with his 552nd victory, while Patrik Elias became the franchise's all-time leading scorer with his 702nd point. The season {{also served as a}} {{break-out}} year for 24-year-old Zach Parise, who led the team with an impressive 45 goals and 94 points.

However, Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour pushed ahead at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>and</b> Rebel Heart debuted at number two with a difference of 12,000 copies. It became Madonna's first studio album to miss the top spot since Bedtime Stories, which also debuted at number two in 1994. The album sold 37,245 copies including 416 from streaming, the lowest first week sales for a studio album by Madonna.

5|$|Meanwhile, a local {{businessman}} named Louis Edwards began accruing {{shares in}} Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman's death in 1965. His son, Martin Edwards, purchased {{a percentage of}} shares from Alan Gibson – son of former owner James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980. During Martin Edwards' time as chairman, Manchester United {{was the subject of}} several takeover bids; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who bid £10million in February 1984, but the sale fell through before any serious talks could take place.

5|$|Nakano {{organised}} {{the withdrawal}} of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of {{the foothills of the}} Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division was to take the coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took the inland one, but this was changed at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> both divisions took the inland route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939. But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers formed {{an alliance of}} convenience. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied both Britain and the Soviets through its Lend-Lease Program. However, Stalin remained highly suspicious and {{he believed that the}} British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the campaign, Michael McDowell {{warned that}} because Fianna Fáil were so high in the opinion polls, they could form a {{government}} by themselves.
