5|$|June 3, 2013: President Barack Obama signs {{into law}} a {{revised version of}} the Stolen Valor Act, making it a federal offense for someone to pass {{themselves}} off as awardees of medals for valor in order <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>benefits</b> or other privileges (such as grants, educational benefits, housing, etc.) that are set aside for veterans and other service members.|$|E
5|$|Simply disclaiming a {{beneficial}} interest does not fall within Section 53(1)(c), as in Re Paradise Motor Co. Nominating somebody <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>benefits</b> of a pension fund should the pensioner die {{is also not}} a valid disposition, as in Re Danish Bacon Co Ltd Staff Pension Fund, and neither is nominating a beneficiary under a life insurance policy, as in Gold v Hill. Where a beneficiary declares he is holding the property on behalf of another, {{this would be the}} creation of a sub-trust and not subject to specific formalities. However, under Grainge v Wilberforce, such a sub-trust will only be held to be valid if there is some difference between the trust and sub-trust, and if the trustee-beneficiary has some duties to perform.|$|E
25|$|The {{criteria}} are applied primarily to international armed conflicts; in civil wars, insurgents are often treated as traitors or criminals by government forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the American Civil War, both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of reciprocity, although the Union regarded Confederate personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>benefits</b> from both {{civilian and military}} status simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage of}} the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, in 2000, allows the worker to earn {{unlimited}} outside income without offsets in the year after they reach full retirement. It also allows the spouse and children of a worker who has reached normal full retirement age <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>benefits</b> under some circumstances while he/she does not. The full retirement age worker must have begun the receipt of benefits, to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspended their own benefits {{in order to continue}} the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount (5.5–8.0%/yr increase) up to the age of 70. Thus a worker can delay retirement up to age seventy without affecting spousal or children's benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Bush {{supports}} {{a decrease in}} capital gains taxes and property taxes. He supports cutting taxes for all Americans and believes they do better with less government interference. Bush also is a supporter of welfare restrictions. [...] He supports the following: [...] a four-year limit of benefits, a requirement that able-bodied recipients participate in work-related activities in order <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>benefits,</b> and limiting benefits given to recipients if they have additional children while on welfare.|$|E
2500|$|The Allen Administration's {{welfare reform}} law also {{addressed}} concerns over single-parent recipients of welfare requiring mothers {{to name the}} child's father and provide three additional pieces of information to help locate the non-custodial parent or face loss of all TANF benefits. [...] Since 1995, Virginia has achieved a 98.5 percent rate of paternity identification, {{the highest in the}} country (Citation Needed). By removing the incentive to break up families, the Allen welfare reform allowed two parent households the same time <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> <b>benefits</b> as single parents. [...] Because this law reversed the incentive of being a single parent TANF cases represented by two parent households increased by over 180 percent.|$|E
