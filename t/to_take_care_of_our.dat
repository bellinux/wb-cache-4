25|$|Ceres, as the Goddess who has {{control over}} nature's {{resources}} and cycles, may astrologically {{be considered the}} planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, {{for which he was}} punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering our collective consciousness as a need <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.|$|E

The {{commercial}} advantages of a great nation lie there in that man's keeping. We no longer require a man <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> moral character before the world.

Others are making pajamas and pillows for the Red Cross, and that's also an admirable thing to do.

Should we never do so, there are doubtless many upon whom you could bestow them; and they are both rarely good animals, for one was {{presented}} to me by Sir Henry Percy, and the other by Sir Edmund Mortimer." ...|$|E

Be he Swiss, or Genoese, either country may be proud of him, but self-love teaches us all <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own {{interests}} before those of another. It Would be far pleasanter to dwell in the Palazzo Grimaldi, on our warm and sunny gulf, honored and esteemed as the heir of a noble name, than to be cutting heads in Berne; and honest Balthazar does but follow his instinct, in seeking preferment for his son!" ...|$|E

It is {{pleasant}} to talk war, and I am with you there, and I've always thought I should go soldiering about this time, but the look of our wrecked village and that carved-up and bloody madman have taught me that I am not made for such work and such sights. I could never be at home in that trade. Face swords and the big guns and death? It isn't in me. No, no; count me out. And besides, I'm the eldest son, and deputy prop and protector of the family.

60|$|As, then, the {{minister}} exhorts us <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> souls, {{and make our}} peace with Heaven, while {{we are in a}} state of health, and while life has no threatening enemies about it, no diseases, no fevers attending; so let me second that advice to the tradesman always to keep his books in such a posture, that if he should be snatched away by death, his distressed widow and fatherless family may know what is left for them, and may know where to look for it. He may depend upon it, that what he owes to any one they will come fast enough for, and his widow and executrix will be pulled to pieces for it, if she cannot and does not speedily pay it. Why, then, should he not put her in a condition to have justice done her and her children, and to know how and of whom to seek for his just debts, that she may be able to pay others, and secure the remainder for herself and her children? I must confess, a tradesman not to leave his books in order when he dies, argues him to be either.|$|E
