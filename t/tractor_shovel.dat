50|$|A {{variety of}} farming {{vehicles}} formed {{part of the}} Corgi Toys range {{for the majority of}} the company's existence under Mettoy's ownership. These models were popular with children from rural areas and today are considered highly collectable. The range was introduced in June 1959 with the Massey Ferguson 65 tractor (50) finished in the manufacturer's familiar red and white colours. An accompanying Massey Ferguson trailer (51) was introduced at the same time, and in April 1960 an operational shovel was added to the tractor as the Massey Ferguson 65 <b>Tractor</b> <b>Shovel</b> (53). The scoop could either be raised or lowered by means of one of two levers and could be tipped by means of the second lever. Both the tractor and trailer were available together as GS 7. The Massey Ferguson combine harvester (1111) was released in August 1959 as part of the Corgi Major range, which featured blades that rotated as the model was pushed along.|$|E
40|$|The {{icebreaker}} FUJI, {{under the}} command of Captain Mamoru MORITA with a crew of 181, left Tokyo on November 25, 1974 on a mission of transportation of members and cargos of the 16 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition. The expedition consisting of 40 members was led by Dr. Takao HOSHIAI. Ten of the 40 men, 7 scientists and 3 technicians, constituted the summer party led by the author as a deputy leader. Dr. HOSHIAI also led the wintering party of 16 scientists and 14 technicians. In addition to the expedition personnel, three observers joined the summer party. Dr. Tetsuo TOMIYAMA, former chancellor of the Tokyo University of Fisheries and councilor for the National Institute of Polar Research, made inspection on summer activities, as an observer sent from the Promoting Headquarters of the Antarctic Research. Mr. Yuki KOBAYASHI, technician from the Ship Research Institute of Ministry of Transport, participated in the 16 th JARE to make research on the navigation of the FUJI for the development of an icebreaker as a trading vessel. Mr. Tadaaki WATANABE, ranger of the Nature Conservation Bureau of Environment Agency, also joined the expedition to collect basic information on wildlife in the Antarctic region so as to consider the administrative measures for wildlife conservation in Antarctica. The present report outlines scientific and logistic activities of the 16 th JARE during the austral summer season, between the departure from Fremantle, Australia on December 16, 1974 and the arrival at Cape Town, South Africa on March 7, 1975. The scientific programme of the 16 th JARE was made by the Specialists Committee of National Institute of Polar Research {{as a part of the}} long-term annual plans. The programme comprised many items in various disciplines as listed in Table 1, and emphasis was laid on environmental sciences such as biology, medical science, chemistry, and on earth sciences. During the summer season several field surveys were schemed in areas around Liitzow-Holm Bay, and stations for oceanographic observation were scheduled along the course of the FUJI from Fremantle via Syowa Station to Gape Town. A new all-sky camera, an automatic developper, an ionosonde, an echo-sounder for submarine stratigraphy, an aero-camera, a continuous analyser for atmospheric NO-Nox, etc. were added to the observation facilities of Syowa Station. The station was also replenished with a KC- 20 and a SM- 15 -S oversnow vehicles, two Yamaha snow mobiles, a TCM STD- 25 <b>tractor</b> <b>shovel,</b> materials of a hut for transmitter, etc. Transported cargos amounted to 470 tons, of which 345 tons were fuel and lubricating oil. The itinerary of the FUJI was determined to be almost the same as that of the previous navigation. When the plan for the summer operation in the Antarctic was being discussed at Tokyo, the U. S. Antarctic Research Program suddenly requested the FUJI to escort the drilling ship GLOMAR CHALLENGER during drilling at the edge of the continental shelf off the Liiser-Larsen Peninsula. The operation plan of the 16 th JARE was adjusted to satisfy the request as far as possible. Unfortunately, the FUJI and the GLOMAR CHALLENGER could not agree on the period of drilling. The FUJI left Fremantle for Antarctica on December 16, 1974 and sailed southward along longitudes between 110 ° and 95 ° East. On December 27 she encountered the first pack ice off the Amery Ice Shelf at 63 ° 542 ̆ 7 S and 67 ° 452 ̆ 7 E, and two days later she made a thrust into the pack ice zone at 65 ° 23. 72 ̆ 7 S and 44 ° 352 ̆ 7 E. Pack ice was so heavily concentrated (7 / 10 ～ 10 / 10) that it took four extra days before the ship reached the edge of the fast ice area. It seems that weak blizzard of December 25 and 26 made pack close and snow accumulation on floe during the blizzard prevented ice from melting. The first flight of a Sikorsky- 69 A helicopter to Syowa Station was made on January 4, 1975 from the point 36 nautical miles north-north-west of Syowa Station. The FUJI started air transportation on a full scale from January 6, trying to approach to the station by charging at fast ice. But the ice was so hard to break that the FUJI was forced to conduct air transportation from the position about 28 nautical miles north-north-west of the station. The weather was fairly fine untill the end of January, and 470 tons of cargos were transported smoothly by air before January 29. Construction work was started on January 4. A pre-fabricated transmitter hut of 72 m^ 2 in area was built within 16 days by hand only, because ice melting prevented a crane truck from getting near the site. Reconstruction of,a dark-room, exchange of a refrigerating machine, exchange of engines of generators, etc. were performed as prearranged. Thus the 16 th wintering members took charge of all scientific and logistic routine works at Syowa Station on February 1, relieving the 15 th wintering members. On the other hand, field surveys during the summer season were conducted in parallel with transportation and construction works. Two members were sent to a depot on the continental ice 18 km east of Syowa Station on January 6 with other four (three 16 th personnel and one 15 th personnel) supporting staffs for deep drilling of ice sheet at Mizuho Camp 300 km south of Syowa Station. They joined four 15 th members who had started drilling work at the beginning of December of 1974. Four supporting staffs returned to Syowa Station on January 17, together with the 15 th JARE traverse party who made a trip to the Yamato Mountains, collecting snow samples at various places for geochemical study. The field surveys in the ice-free areas along the coast were rather intensive than those on the previous occasions. Four biologists and one chemist stayed in the Langhovde ice-free area from 13 th to 20 th of January. They made an ecological study of lichens and mosses and a limnological study of lakes. One of the results is the discovery of one species of moss (Bryum argenteum) which was not reported in the Liitzow-Holm Bay region till then. From January 27 to February 2, the Skarvsnes area, the largest ice-free area on the Prince Harald and Prince Olav Coasts, was visited by field scientists consisting of four biologists, two geochemists, two geologists, and one geomorphologist. Items of observation were detailed geological mapping of bedrock, coastal geomorphology, limnological study of both saline and fresh-water lakes, and ecological study of lichens and mosses. Living flagellate algae were found in the highly saline water of Lake Hunazoko. The water is also rich in chlorophyll-a. A new moss (Tortula sp.) was discovered from the Liitzow-Holm Bay region, and a kind of Bryum in connexum was found to have adapted itself to shallow fresh-water lakes. In addition, rather extensive surveys including ground surveying were carried out by eleven scientists in the Akarui Point ice-free area between 6 th and 8 th of February. Traverse surveying, basic surveying, and astronomical observation were also conducted by eight members from January 23 to February 2 in Padda Island, Austhovde Rock, and the Rundvagskollane ice-free area. Aerial Photography of the coastal areas was made by a Cessna 185. The above-mentioned field surveys were conducted by the joint party of the 16 th and 15 th JARE personnel under the supervision of the author. The author also had several occasions to make reconnaissance observation on ice conditions of sea ice and glaciers by helicopter and Cessna flights. It gave us information on the fluctuation of the snout on the ice-tongue of the Shirase Glacier and on the distribution of ice-shelf-like floating tongues on the west coast of Liitzow-Holm Bay. The FUJI left the transportation position on February 12 just after evacuating the drilling staff members of Mizuho Camp from the depot, and began to cruise north for the margin of pack ice zone. However, she was stuck with heavily concentrated ice at the point 53 nautical miles north-north-west of Syowa Station. She was beset for one week and drifted 40 nautical miles westward with the surrounding pack ice. On February 18 the ice condition began to change and fractures developed in the hammocked pack around the ship. The weather became fine on February 19, and the reconnaissance long-distance flight revealed that the ship could sail to the west if she could break ice 300 m ahead the bow. Explosion of ice set the FUJI free from the beset state and she moved slowly forward to the west. On February 21 she was able to reach the edge of the pack ice zone through large open water off the Liiser-Larsen Peninsula. On account of the delayed arrival at the pack ice margin, oceanographic observation stations had to be reduced compared with the original plan. Moreover, oceanographers gave up the observation between March 3 and 7, because a member of the crew was seized with acute attack of appendicitis. To rush the patient to the hospital the FUJI made the best of her cruise and entered the harbour of Cape Town on March 7, two days earlier than scheduled...|$|E
5000|$|The Hubley Manufacturing Company {{was first}} {{incorporated}} in 1894 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania by John Hubley. The first Hubley toys appeared in 1909 and {{were made of}} cast-iron, with themes that ranged from horse-drawn vehicles and different breeds of dogs, to <b>tractors,</b> steam <b>shovels</b> and guns (Smitsonian Institution, website). Hubley's main competition {{in the early years}} was Arcade (Richardson 1999, p. 46). Early toys were known for their complexity; a delicate 11 inch long Packard Straight 8, a five-ton truck that came complete with tools, a road roller that came in five different sizes, a steam shovel with working arms and shovel, and Chrysler Airflows with take-apart bodies (Richardson 1999, p. 46). Hubley's was especially known for its many motorcycles, which were creative and often included sidecars or hooked to delivery vans that said, for example, [...] "Say it with flowers" [...] on the sides (Richardson 1999, p. 46).|$|R
40|$|Heavy load equipment, such as <b>tractors,</b> <b>shovels,</b> cranes, airplanes, etc, often employ {{fluid power}} (i. e. hydraulic) systems {{to control their}} loads by way of valve {{adjustment}} in a pump-valve control configuration. Most of these systems have low energy efficiency {{as a consequence of}} pressure losses across throttle valves. Much of the energy is converted into heat energy which can have determinantal effects on component life and the surrounding environment. From an energy efficiency point of view, an ideal hydraulic system is one that does not include any throttling valve. One such circuit is made of a variable pump and motor load (pump/motor configuration). The velocity of the load is controlled by manipulating the pump displacement or by changing the rotary speed of the pump shaft. In such a system, the transient response of the load is often unsatisfactory because it is difficult to quickly and accurately manipulate the pump displacement or change shaft speed. Thus circuit design must be a compromise between the energy efficiency of the pump/motor system and the controllability of a pump/valve/motor combination. One possible compromise is to use a pump-valve configuration which reduces energy losses across the valve. One way to achieve this is by controlling the pressure drop across the valve and limiting it to a small value, independent of load pressure. Based on this idea, a type of hydraulic control system, usually called load-sensing (LS), has recently been used in the flow power area. This type of system, however, is complex and under certain operating conditions exhibits instability problems. Methods for compensating these instabilities are usually based on a trial-and-error approach. Although some research has resulted in the definition of some instability criterion, a comprehensive and verifiable approach is still lacking. This research concentrates on identifying the relationship between system parameters and instability in one particular type of LS system. Due to the high degree of non-linearity in LS systems, the instabilities are dependent on the steady state operating point. The study therefore concentrates first on identifying all of the steady state operating points and then classifying them into three steady state operating regions. A dynamic model for each operating region is developed to predict the presence of instabilities. Each model is then validated experimentally. This procedure, used {{in the study of the}} LS system, is also applied to a pressure compensated (PC) valve. A PC valve is one in which the flow rate is independent in variations to load pressure. A system which combines a LS pump and a PC valve (for the controlling orifice) is called a load sensing pressure compensated (LSPC) system. This research, then, examines the dynamic performance of the LSPC system using the operating points and steady state operating regions identified in the first part of the research. The original contributions of this research include: (a) establishment of three steady state operating conditions defined as “Condition I, II & III”, which are based on the solution of steady state non-linear equations; (b) the provision of an empirical model of the orifice discharge coefficient suitable for laminar and turbulent flow, and the transition region between them; (c) and the development of an analytical expression for orifice flow which makes it possible to accurately model and simulate a hydraulic system with pilot stage valve or pump/motor compensator. These contributions result in a practical and reliable method to determine the stability of a LS or LSPC system at any operating point and to optimize the design of the LS or LSPC system...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} is to {{summarize}} usage of tractors in timber extraction and major problems of mechanized&# 13; timber harvesting in Turkey. Timber harvesting in Turkey is still carried out by manual methods due to&# 13; economical, social and environmental constraints. Almost 80 % of harvesting activities are mechanized in many&# 13; developed countries while this value is only 5 % in Turkey. Overall ratio of mechanization is relatively low. &# 13; Approximately percentage of man power, animal power, machine power and skyline harvesting are 72, 15, 8 and&# 13; 5 %, respectively. Turkish General Directorate of Forestry's mechanical park total amount is 457 in 2004. &# 13; Mechanical park amount has been reduced to 19 tractors (4 x 4 and assembled shovel), 169 skidding winches,&# 13; 6 tractors with equipment of snow cleaner, 46 forklifts, 26 loaders, 32 skylines, 65 agricultural tractors, 88 trucks,&# 13; 4 agricultural <b>tractors</b> with <b>shovel,</b> 2 barking machines as of 2004. Approximate percentages of skidders, trucks,&# 13; 4 x 2 tractors, forklifts, skylines, loaders, 4 x 4 tractors and barking machines are 36. 9, 19. 3, 16. 4, 10, 7, 5. 7, 4. 2 and&# 13; 0. 5 % in 2004. 4 x 2 and 4 x 4 tractors total amount has been reached to 41. 7 % in 1982, but this percentage has been&# 13; reduced to 20. 6 % in 2004. Total machine park amount has been reduced 41. 4 % between years 1998 - 2004 in&# 13; Turkey. In spite of existence of substantial number of harvesters, the amount of modern harvesting processor in&# 13; Turkey is not sufficient. Different type and marked machine hasn't taken into consideration to improve&# 13; mechanization and a poor standardization in harvesting is another problem in Turkey...|$|R
