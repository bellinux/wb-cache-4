5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E
500|$|Casting south {{close to}} the island of Augusta (Lastovo), Captain Gordon in Active sighted the French force at 09:20 on 29 November, sailing to the north-west. Initially the French ships held their course, but on {{determining}} that the approaching squadron was British, Montfort spread all sail to escape pursuit. By 11:00 {{it was evident that}} Persanne could not maintain the pace of the two larger frigates and so turned north-east in hopes of escaping independently. Active initially gave chase to the smaller ship, but Maxwell recalled her and sent Unite after Persanne, keeping Active and Alceste in pursuit of the larger French ships. At 11:50 it became clear that Alceste would soon catch the heavily laden French ships, and Maxwell sent the <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> to Gordon; [...] "Remember the battle of Lissa", the action of eight months before at which Hoste had raised the signal [...] "Remember Nelson".|$|E

50|$|Charles Vincent Walker FRS (20 March 1812 - 24 December 1882) was an English {{electrical}} engineer and publisher, {{a major influence}} on the development of railway telecommunications, he was also the first person to send a submarine <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "repeater" [...] {{originated}} with telegraphy in the 19th century, {{and referred to}} an electromechanical device (a relay) used to regenerate <b>telegraph</b> <b>signals.</b> Use of the term has continued in telephony and data communications.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, frequency-change <b>signaling</b> is a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signaling</b> {{method in}} which one or more {{particular}} frequencies correspond to each desired signaling condition of a telegraph code. The transition from one set of frequencies to the other may be a continuous or a discontinuous change in the frequency or phase.|$|R
50|$|Keying is {{a family}} of {{modulation}} forms where the modulating signal takes one of a specific (predetermined) number of values at all times. The goal of keying is to transmit a digital signal over an analog channel. The name derives from the Morse code key used for <b>telegraph</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Remote {{control systems}} on modern ships {{usually have a}} control {{transfer}} system allowing control to be transferred between locations. Remote control is usually possible from two locations the bridge and the engine control room. Some ships lack a remote control handle in the ECR. When in bridge control mode, the bridge handle directly controls the engine set point. When in Engine control room mode the bridge handle sends a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> to the ECR and the ECR handle controls the set point of the control system. In local control, the remote control system is inactive and the bridge handle sends a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> to the local control position and the engine is operated by its manual controls in the engine room ...|$|E
50|$|A simple device, {{which is}} now called a relay, was {{included}} in the original 1840 telegraph patent of Samuel Morse. The mechanism described acted as a digital amplifier, repeating the <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal,</b> and thus allowing signals to be propagated as far as desired. This overcame the problem of limited range of earlier telegraphy schemes.|$|E
5000|$|Morse at {{one time}} adopted Wheatstone and Carl August von Steinheil's idea of {{broadcasting}} an electrical <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> through {{a body of water}} or down steel railroad tracks or anything conductive.

He built the chronograph used for timing races at Flemington Racecourse, and was appointed their official timekeeper. In November 1876 he was made a life member of the VRC, though he {{had little interest in}} the sport. In 1885 he built and patented an electric scratching board system which ensured that notification of scratchings was made simultaneously throughout the course as soon as notified to the secretary.|$|E

He envisioned a home where all kinds of devices generated [...] "message wavelets" [...] to share the electromagnetic spectrum, foreshadowing Ethernet. Sweigert's philosophy was [...] "the simpler, the better, as could be understood by a child". He often recounted Einstein's experience of reading a children's story about a child racing a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> going through a wire.|$|E
50|$|The {{disaster}} scenario actually involved three successive northbound trains on {{the same}} track, which all left Brighton station {{within a few minutes}} of one another. The signalman {{at the south end of}} the tunnel tried to stop the second train from entering the tunnel before the first one had left it, but wrongly thought his red flag had not been seen, and then misinterpreted a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> from the north end of the tunnel as referring to the second train instead of the first. Assuming that both trains had cleared the tunnel, he signalled the third one to proceed, but in fact the second train was trying to reverse out of the tunnel.|$|E

50|$|The second thrust area is {{noise and}} {{reliability}} of nanoelectronic devices. In the early 1980s, {{as a graduate student}} under the supervision of Professor Thomas Hsiang, Celik-Butler has developed one of the first 1/f noise theories based on McWhorter Noise Model and applied to Metal-Oxide Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs). Most recently, the same model has been revised to account for low-frequency noise observed on multi-stack gate MOSFETs, specifically high-k dielectric gate oxides. The research group has also investigated and developed noise models for polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors, lateral pnp bipolar transistors and sige heterojunction bipolar transistors. One of the contributions of the research group is the demonstration of Random <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Signal</b> (RTS) noise as a non-destructive characterization and reliability tool in nanoelectronics. Today, this research thrust area is investigating the effect of extended drain region on noise {{and reliability of}} LDMOS structures.|$|E

50|$|The members {{agreed that}} on Sunday, November 18, 1883, all United States and Canadian railroads would {{readjust}} their clocks and watches {{to reflect the}} new five-zone system on a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> from the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh at exactly noon on the 90th meridian. Although most railroads adopted the new system as scheduled, some did so early on October 7 and others late on December 2. The Intercolonial Railway serving the Canadian maritime provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia just east of Maine decided not to adopt Intercolonial Time based on the 60th meridian west of Greenwich, instead adopting Eastern Time, so only four time zones were actually adopted by U.S./Canadian railroads in 1883. Major American observatories, including the Allegheny Observatory, the United States Naval Observatory, the Harvard College Observatory, and the Yale University Observatory, agreed to provide telegraphic time signals at noon Eastern Time.|$|E
5000|$|On October 15, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{pressed a}} button on his desk in Washington, D.C., sending a <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> that set off the first blast of {{dynamite}} at the portal of the right diversion tunnel. Drilling the tunnels through the porous Navajo sandstone abutting the dam site posed major problems for the excavation crews of the Mountain States Construction Company, which won the contract for the diversion tunnels in 1956. Transporting workers and equipment {{to the bottom of}} the canyon was extremely difficult. Initially, transport was done by barge from Wahweap Creek, but the fast current of the Colorado River could be dangerous. After a barge capsized, spilling tons of machinery into the river, a much safer cable-car system was installed. [...] During excavation, the rock frequently broke apart or [...] "slabbed" [...] and collapsed into the tunnels, and metal bolts had to be drilled into the rock to secure it. The largest such event, on August 5, 1958, sent [...] crashing down onto the upper portal of the left diversion tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke <b>signals,</b> semaphore <b>telegraphs,</b> <b>signal</b> flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|R
50|$|Post and <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Signals</b> was a (reserve) {{regiment}} of the Ceylon Army. Raised in 1955 {{with staff}} from the Department of Post and Ceylon Telegraph Department.
