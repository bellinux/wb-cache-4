2500|$|People {{talk about}} [...] "chav behaviour" [...] or [...] "chav insults" [...] {{and that sort}} of thing. Oh, don't believe the popular etymologies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> {{sometimes}} in the press and on websites. I saw one the other day, people said, [...] "It's an acronym, 'chav', from 'council house and violent'"—well, no, it isn't, that was made up in recent times.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, bless me," [...] Frank exclaimed, [...] "you don't {{mean to say}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> Virgil in Latin! You are a rum fellow. How {{on earth}} did you learn it?" ...|$|E
50|$|I hope, John, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will <b>read</b> this.|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. [shuddering] Ugh! Well, I'd do even <b>that</b> for <b>you.</b> <b>Read</b> The Master Builder.|$|R
6000|$|After a pause, {{during which}} he closely {{scrutinized}} my face, he said, pointing to the open page before him: [...] "Yesterday, in answer to my question, <b>you</b> told me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could <b>read.</b> Last evening <b>you</b> made a contrary statement to Yoletta; and now here is the book, and <b>you</b> confess <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot <b>read</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "B'gee!" [...] muttered Thomas, [...] "this listens like a spook shop. Shouldn't {{wonder if}} it ain't one of these Moravian Nights' adventures <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> about. Wonder what became of the furry guy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} how father loves his scarabs. Since {{he retired from}} business, he has been simply wrapped up in them. You know collectors are like <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>read</b> in the papers about men giving all sorts of money for funny things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. This ark {{was called}} 'the ark of the {{covenant}},' {{as the first}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of was called 'Noah's,' because as he in that was kept from being drowned, so the tables of the covenant were kept in this from breaking.|$|E
50|$|OnePlace.com offers free devotionals <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>read</b> on {{the site}} or receive by email.|$|R
60|$|HAROLD (pulling out a newspaper). Well, my man, {{it seems}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>read.</b> Look there--under the deaths.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} your rabbits. I {{want to hear}} <b>that</b> piece <b>you</b> <b>read</b> before. The one about the Prince of Monaco. Will--you--listen, Marion!" ...|$|R
6000|$|There it stands, though alas, what {{a little}} of her [...] Shows in its cold white look! Not her glance, glide, or smile; not a tittle of her [...] Voice like the purl of a brook; [...] Not her thoughts, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> like a book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't {{you ever}} say nice things? Or is {{it the way you}} English have?" [...] There was a snap in her gray eyes, and her lips quivered suspiciously for a moment. [...] "I should recommend, Mr. Sheldon, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> Gertrude Atherton's 'American Wives and English Husbands.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Lamech signifieth poor, or smitten; {{wherefore}} I {{doubt that}} the apostacy <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of in the next chapter, began either in the days of, or by, this man: he being, as it seems, more dry and void of grace than those that went before him; poor, or smitten.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has nearly}} all the qualities which go to make a book of the first-class. Before <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> twenty pages <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are <b>reading</b> a classic."--Literary World.|$|R
6000|$|Besides, {{that this}} holy city <b>that</b> here <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of is the church, the gospel church, {{returning}} {{out of her}} long and antichristian captivity; consider, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good again, lad. A worthy son of your father. I didn't give 'e {{credit for}} {{sharpness}} enough to perceive <b>that.</b> Can <b>you</b> <b>read</b> anything more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Tudor {{tells me}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> aloud well, sing sweetly, possess a cheerful temper, and the quiet, patient ways which are peculiarly {{grateful}} to an invalid," [...] began Mrs. Carrol, with that keen yet wistful gaze, and an anxious accent {{in her voice}} that went to Christie's heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Israel may {{be taken}} for such as are neither so after the flesh, nor the Spirit, but in their own fancy and {{imagination}} only. And such I take to be all those <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of in Revelation 2:9 which said 'they were Jews, and were not,' 'but did lie' (3:9).|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Men are not {{rejected}} for their bad deeds. This is evident by Manasseh, by the murderers of our Lord Jesus Christ, {{by the men}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of in the nineteenth of the Acts, with many others, whose sins were of as deep a dye as {{the sins of the}} worst of men (2 Chron 33:2,13; Acts 2:23,41; 19:19).|$|E
30|$|We hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> enjoy <b>reading</b> this {{selection}} of papers that samples {{the variety of}} modalities and themes in current biometrics research.|$|R

60|$|Q. How is self-denial a {{proof of}} the truth of a man's {{affections}} to God?--A. In that {{for the sake of}} his service, he leaveth all his enjoyments in this world. Thus he proved Abraham's affections (Gen 22:12). Thus he proved Peter's affections (Matt 4:18-22) and thus he proved their affection <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of in the gospel (Luke 9:57-73).|$|E
60|$|By {{this action}} the Lord God did preach to Adam, {{and to his}} wife, the meaning of that promise <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of in verse 15. Namely, That by the means of Jesus Christ, God himself would provide a {{sufficient}} clothing for those that accept of his grace by the gospel: The coats here, being a type of that blessed and durable righteousness.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir; {{the country}} was full of it. Isaac knew all about <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>read</b> the Bible. Don't you worry about the tough places. They ain't tough {{when you come to}} think them out and throw light on them. There ain't a thing in the Bible but what is true; all you want is to go prayerfully to work and cipher out how 'twas done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They were on his tray this morning. I {{brought them}} because I had heard <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>read</b> great {{things out of}} small ones." ...|$|R

60|$|The Yankee Carterets {{went into}} {{business}} in New York {{long before the}} war. Their house, as far as Leather Belting and Mill Supplies was concerned, was as musty and arrogant and solid {{as one of those}} old East India tea-importing concerns <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> about in Dickens. There were some rumors of a war behind its counters, but not enough to affect the business.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you must}} also remember, Roger," [...] Oswald said with a smile, [...] "that {{if it had not}} been <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> and wrote, better than most of the other monks, the abbot would not have picked you out as my instructor, I should not have asked for you to come with me to Scotland, and Sir Henry Percy would never have begged the abbot to allow you to go forth into the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. By {{crying out}} scarcity, scarcity, beyond {{the truth and}} state of things: {{especially}} take heed of doing of this {{by way of a}} prognostick for time to come. 'Twas for {125b} this for which he was trodden to death in the gate of Samaria, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> of in the book of Kings. This sin has a double evil in it. 1. It belieth the present blessing of God amongst us: and, 2. It undervalueth the riches of his goodness, which can make all good things to abound towards us.|$|E
60|$|This {{must go to}} <b>you</b> to-morrow, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> may <b>read</b> it on Christmas Day for company. I hope it may be {{good company}} to you.|$|R
