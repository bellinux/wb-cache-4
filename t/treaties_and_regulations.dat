2500|$|While the <b>Treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>Regulations</b> {{will have}} direct effect (if clear, {{unconditional}} and immediate), Directives do not generally give citizens (as {{opposed to the}} member state) standing to sue other citizens. In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually [...] "leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods" [...] to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves.

From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the <b>Treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>Regulations,</b> if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to {{not be allowed to}} bring claims against other non-state parties.

40|$|The chief current {{problems}} for Europe, apart from possible decisions {{bearing on the}} Schengen Treaty and its costs, concern compliance with the rules on the government budget deficit (3 per cent of GDP) and the public debt (60 per cent).

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{coherence}} between industrial policy, competition policy and trade {{policy in the}} European Union (EU). This assessment is undertaken {{from the perspective of}} the optimal deployment of economic policies as prescribed by economic analysis and takes into consideration the legal mandate and the institutional constraints imposed by EU <b>treaties</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations.</b> The analysis shows that as a result of the limited policy tools available to the Union, trade and competition policies have to fulfil several competing goals. This multiplicity of objectives leads to non-optimal interventions. Policy inconsistencies arise also between trade/competition policies and the industrial policy of Member States. Current policy practice leads to inefficient outcomes both in mature and sunrise industries. These inefficiencies could be reduced with a reinforcement of integration policies (notably, state aid control). The paper argues that the current institutional arrangements allow for a strengthening of centralized industrial policy, however, which could be usefully utilized to achieve more efficient outcomes. Other policy conflicts, mostly between trade and competition policies, are also discussed. Competition Policy; Industrial Policy; Trade Policy...|$|E

The aim of my work is to introduce legal framework of the highway tax, reveal its strengths and weaknesses, highlight some key institutes, compare Czech, Slovak and German legal framework of the tax, and so to inspire to efficiency improvement of the Czech legal framework. The work is divided into five chapters. The first chapter serves as an introduction to the topic. This chapter deals with the elementary questions of the Highway tax. I focused mainly on its importance, characteristics and status in the Czech Republic. An important part is a history and overview of the amendments to the Highway Tax Act.
