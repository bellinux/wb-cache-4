5|$|The 1st century CE Book of Acts {{refers to}} Azotus {{as the place}} in which Philip <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist</b> reappeared after he {{converted}} the Ethiopian eunuch to Christianity. Philip preached the gospel throughout the area until he reached Caesarea, about 90km to the north.|$|E
50|$|In their {{earliest}} appearances, <b>the</b> <b>Evangelists</b> were {{depicted in}} their human forms {{each with a}} scroll or a book to represent the Gospels. By the 5th century, images of <b>the</b> <b>Evangelists</b> evolved into their respective tetramorphs. By the later Middle Ages, the tetramorph {{in the form of}} creatures was used less frequently. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>Evangelists</b> were often shown in their human forms accompanied by their symbolic creatures, or as men with the heads of animals.|$|R

5|$|The {{most famous}} {{feature of the}} choir is the set of choir stalls, dating from about 1380, and {{described}} above. The lectern, {{in the form of}} a wooden eagle, symbol of John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist,</b> dates from the first half of the 17thcentury. The candlesticks also date from the 17thcentury and are by Censore of Bologna who died in 1662.|$|E

5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist,</b> and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E

5|$|However, Wason had {{expected}} the Methven Branch railway {{to be built}} near Barrhill, {{but when it was}} built on a more southerly route along Thompsons Track and what was later to become known as Lauriston, the village began to decline. Dwindling population forced the closure of the school in 1938, although the Church of St John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist</b> is still in use. Most of the buildings were constructed from pine wood grown on the estate, but the three original concrete buildings remain: church, school and schoolhouse.|$|E
5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper in creation. The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. <b>The</b> <b>evangelist</b> adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E
5|$|Lichton's death {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. It fell between 11 November (Martinmas) 1440, and 11 January 1441; {{it is probable}} that he died on either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given to him in the 15th century and the 16th century respectively. He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist.</b> As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving papal dispensation to marry in 1432.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the first}} part was completed, Smederevo Fortress quickly became an {{important}} connection between the Balkans and central Europe. Shortly after it was built, the city reached its peak importance as a religious, commercial, and trade center, at which point it was populated mainly by Serbs and colonies of merchants, primarily from Dubrovnik. Around the same time, the relics of Saint Luke <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist,</b> who became {{the patron saint of}} Smederevo, were brought and stored in the church in the fortress.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist</b> flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

5|$|The former St John the Evangelist's Church {{was listed}} at Grade II on 20 August 1971. It is a Greek Revival-style stucco-clad {{building}} {{of stone and}} brick with a partly hipped roof. The three-bay façade has four Tuscan pilasters beneath a substantial entablature and pediment. The frieze between them has metopes and triglyphs. Work by L.A. Mackintosh in 1957 altered the exterior; the architect added his personal monogram and an eagle emblem (representing John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist)</b> above {{the left and right}} entrances respectively.|$|E

5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist</b> in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} of The Dream of Gerontius. He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also appeared {{from time to time in}} operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The quality of his voice and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel side had a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle side had {{the names of the}} apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist,</b> Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{purchased}} the art collection of Richard Hart Davis and others. The mansion eventually housed {{a collection of}} over a hundred paintings representing many Old Masters – Domenichino (including the St John <b>the</b> <b>Evangelist</b> sold in 2009 for £9.2 million), Titian, Poussin, Michelangelo, Raphael, Rubens, Claude Lorrain (including the Altieri Claudes) and Van Dyke, as well as numerous family portraits, however {{the majority of the}} more famous paintings were sold between 1884 and 1898. In the middle of the 19th century it was possible to visit the house to view the art collection on Thursday afternoons upon application to the Miles family's business offices at 61 Queen Square, Bristol (formerly the house of Philip John Miles's father, William Miles).|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to <b>the</b> <b>evangelist.</b> However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E
