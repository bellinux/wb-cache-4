5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to D-Day, {{full-scale}} rehearsals of Operation Peppermint were carried out in order to test <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> the equipment.

5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI {{sparked a}} war between Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>and</b> instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E

Alternatively, a developer that is also a builder may purchase a property with <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> <b>and</b> permits in place {{so that they do}} not have the risk of failing to obtain <b>planning</b> approval <b>and</b> can start construction on the development immediately.|$|R
5|$|Born in North Sydney, New South Wales, Madgwick {{trained as}} a schoolteacher before {{attaining}} degrees in economics and economic history from the University of Sydney and University of Oxford. Appointed as a lecturer at the University of Sydney, Madgwick worked in the school's extension program which gave him experience and interest in adult education. With the onset of World War II, Madgwick and his colleagues proposed an adult education plan for the Australian Army. The government accepted <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and,</b> from 1941 to 1946, Madgwick served on active duty as Director of the Australian Army Education Service, which provided adult education services to the Army's 250,000 members during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, {{proposed}} {{reducing the}} five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three. One of these would have been Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Australian Government rejected <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place until supplanted in 1953–54 by a functional command-and-control system made up of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands.|$|E
5|$|Hines {{went to the}} Confederate {{capital of}} Richmond, Virginia, after his escape in January 1864. He {{convinced}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{of a plan to}} instill mass panic in the Northern states, by means of freeing prisoners and causing arson in larger Northern cities. Impressed by Hines' plan, Davis agreed to back him. Davis urged Hines to tell Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin and Secretary of War James Seddon his plan. Both men agreed to <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>and</b> encouraged Hines to proceed, with the only hesitation by Davis, Benjamin and Sheldon being the effect on public opinion on such a plan, including what Great Britain and France would think of Hines' actions.|$|E

5|$|In September 1946, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, {{proposed}} {{reducing the}} five extant mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The Federal government rejected <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> the wartime area command boundaries essentially remained in place (although NWA no longer covered the Dutch East Indies).|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the plan, Ivan and his cavalry approached Constantinople while Michael Shishman waited in Yambol with his army. The plot was uncovered by the spies of Andronikos III. Fearing for his own imperial ambitions, {{he wrote to his}} rival and grandfather not to accept the Bulgarians into the capital. While Ivan stuck to <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> signed an oath that he had come with peace to persuade the Byzantines, he promptly retreated to Bulgarian territory upon receiving that order from Michael Shishman.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the offensive, in May 1942, U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the U.S. to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval, and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia. Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides {{was selected as the}} headquarters and main base for the impending offensive—codenamed Operation Watchtower—with the commencement date set for 7 August 1942. At first, the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands, omitting Guadalcanal. However, after Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, capture of that airfield was added to <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> the Santa Cruz operation was dropped.|$|E

This initiative called for negotiating each point of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia. However, Ahrens and Stoltenberg considered any talks between Croatia and the exiled, discredited leaders of the RSK impossible. When they consulted Šarinić about the initiative, he dismissed any possibility of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led to {{the demise}} of many of his proposals, {{regardless}} of their merits. He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and, though the idea had been proposed by previous governors, Slaughter devised a means of funding it. The hostile legislature refused <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including the creation of a state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E

5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, a {{classified}} booster rocket that {{can carry a}} payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two years}} earlier, using the Chinese booster to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>and</b> NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the plan was that, politically at least, it abandoned most of eastern Belgium to the Germans. Militarily it would put the Allied rear {{at right angles to}} the French frontier defences; while for the British, their communications located at the Bay of Biscay ports, would be parallel to their front. Despite the risk of committing forces to central Belgium and an advance to the Schedlt or Dyle lines, which would be vulnerable to an outflanking move, Maurice Gamelin, the French commander, approved <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> it remained the Allied strategy upon the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler {{asked for}} a pretext for the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded a false flag plan code-named Operation Himmler. It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> toured the site, which was about four miles from the Polish border. Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse {{as an excuse to}} launch his invasion.|$|E

5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>and</b> Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's attempt to reduce the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{decided to}} reject the offer of the young Kansan (who {{followed}} through with <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>and</b> was later killed), and {{that he needed to}} leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to <b>the</b> <b>plan,</b> <b>and</b> decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E
