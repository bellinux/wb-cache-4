25|$|At one time, 25 {{subspecies}} of beavers {{were identified}} in North America, with distinctions based primarily on slight morphological differences and geographical isolation {{at the time of}} discovery. However, modern techniques generally use genetics rather than morphology to distinguish between subspecies, and currently the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (which provides authoritative taxonomic information on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of North America and <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> <b>does</b> not recognize any subspecies of C. canadensis, though a definitive genetic analysis has not been performed. Such an analysis would be {{complicated by the fact that}} substantial genetic mixing of populations has occurred because of the numerous reintroduction efforts intended to help the species recover following extirpation from many regions.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, rice rats were {{discovered}} at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys, and in 1978 Spitzer and Lazell described this {{population as a}} new species, Oryzomys argentatus. The status of this form—either a distinct species or not even subspecifically distinct from O.palustris natator—has remained controversial since; the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>does</b> not recognize O.argentatus as a separate species, but acknowledges a need for further research. A 2005 study using microsatellite DNA found that Florida Keys rice rats exhibit low genetic variation and are significantly different from Everglades rice rats; the study concluded in favor of classifying the Keys rice rat as a [...] "distinct vertebrate population". This population probably diverged from mainland rice rats about 2000 years ago.|$|E

500|$|At that time, {{it seemed}} a place in which {{anything}} could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors {{from all parts of}} Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: [...] "What Manchester does today, the rest of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>does</b> tomorrow."•• Manchester's golden age was perhaps {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{called this}} idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>does,</b> and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But {{how is it possible}} that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>does</b> not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E

500|$|As {{had also}} {{been the case with}} his predecessors, the rank of {{adjutant}} was seen by Joaquim Inácio as an embarrassment. Inside the armada administration, it denoted the most important office, as it was filled by an officer who acted as the navy minister's direct representative in the armada. Even so, the title of [...] "adjutant" [...] was itself perceived as demeaning. Joaquim Inácio later complained: [...] "In what part of <b>the</b> <b>world...</b> <b>does</b> the navy minister have a general officer as an adjutant? What is an adjutant, other than a young officer who transmits orders, and even messages, he receives from his chief?" [...] He concluded: [...] "Thus the title of adjutant cannot encumber an officer who supervises the armada's discipline and answers for it." [...] His request to have the designation for the position changed to a more appropriate title was ignored. He also felt slighted that many of his proposals to the navy boards regarding improvements were not acted on, and on 21 November 1860, he asked to be removed from all positions.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>does</b> end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the book}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. It was listed by Rolling Stone {{as one of}} the 10 Best Music Books in 2016. Jason Diamond from the publication reviewed it and found that the book gave a [...] "fuller, weirder and more interesting overview of Madonna" [...] than was already present in previous works about her. He complimented the author's [...] "riveting" [...] way of presenting the past figures from Bay City associated with the singer as well as Simone's own transition into indie music. Jennifer Levin from The Santa Fe New Mexican commended Simone's [...] "wit and grace" [...] in reporting Bay City's troubled relationship with Madonna, including the political agenda surrounding her. She noted that the story found its footing at the point in the book where the author wrote about Flying Wedge (in the last chapter). Writing for PopMatters, Megan Volpert rated the book 7 out of 10 stars, and described it as [...] "excellent", suggesting it as an important addition to modern cultural criticism. She commended Simone's writing and her courage to pick up an unusual subject for the book. Volpert commented, [...] "Does the world need one more half-baked biographical update on Madonna? No, it does not. What <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>does</b> need is Simone's productively clear-eyed assessment of her own musical and journalistic failures, [...] for the detours unavoidably provoked by fame and fandom," [...] concluded the review.|$|E
