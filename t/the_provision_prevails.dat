40|$|Generativity is a {{constitutive}} {{dimension of}} social work, that is announced in its ethical bases but neglected in professional practice, {{in which the}} monetary intervention and <b>the</b> professional <b>provision</b> <b>prevail.</b> <b>The</b> research project {{was inspired by the}} “generative welfare” proposal and it is divided in two main parts. The first part aims at deepening the understanding of the processes of activation and empowerment of the people taken in charge by the social service. The second part focuses on the possibility and feasibility of an approach to social support endowed with more sociability. The generativity approach has been dealt with from two different point of view: the socio/anthropological and the social work one. The first perspective takes into account such issues as relational goods, social capital and the dimensions of subjectivity and significance. The second makes reference to the theories which enlighten the importance of the valorisation of people's resources and the constructionist approach. The qualitative research involved Sardinia and Trentino, and was divided into two levels. The first one involved the beneficiaries of the social work intervention: their stories were collected in order to come in touch with their representations of the condition they live, and their feelings about the support they received. The second level involved the social workers of the two regions. Through the focus group methodology it was possible to observe their representations about the social demand received by their offices and the effectiveness of the interventions. The empirical data underline the necessity to overcome a performance logic and to move to forms of help and support that holds responsible those who receive them...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the relationship of managerial compensation to <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses. This study discusses the arguments that have made the relationship between managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses an intuitively appealing concept within the broad agency literature, and, based on these arguments, conducts empirical tests aimed at determining whether managerial compensation does relate to <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses. ^ The most current means of studying the income-compensation relationship, the compensation coefficients, makes finding a good understanding of managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan loss reserves an important goal. <b>The</b> loan loss <b>provision</b> is hypothesized to be a function of loan quality and managerial compensation. If internal and external parties interested in bank performance and reporting better understand the relationship between managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses, more efficient labor contracts can be written and financial performance and reporting should be improved. ^ The structure of the empirical tests flows from the argument that earnings management represents a cost to shareholders. This argument rests on the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses specifically plays a central role in managerial compensation at financial institutions. Recent work in agency theory is utilized to construct the setting in which <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses is tested for its ability to influence earnings. The empirical model constructed is a multiple regression equation with <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan loss as the dependent variable, and asset equity, income and compensation item as independent variables. ^ The empirical results show that the relationship between managerial compensation and <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses is much like the arguments would suggest. Although assets, equity and income are the dominant factors in explaining <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses, managerial compensation plays a role in explaining <b>the</b> <b>provision</b> for loan losses. ...|$|R

30|$|We {{have shown}} how SDG-Pro {{provides}} API encapsulation {{of the most}} important aspects related to gateway provisioning and governance. A key advantage of this approach is that developers do not need to explicitly worry about the underlying infrastructure. Rather, they perceive the complex and heterogeneous IoT cloud infrastructure as a set of uniform APIs that enable programmatic management of such infrastructure. Our SDG-Pro framework supports the developers to declaratively provision IoT cloud systems and to automate most of <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. This improves general readability and maintainability of <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> logic and simplifies <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process. Additionally, by encoding <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> directives as part of application’s source code, our framework makes <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> process easily repeatable. This reduces the potential errors, but more importantly enables continuous, automated enforcement of the configuration base line.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a path {{computation}} element (PCE) - based provisioning framework for carrier-grade multi-protocol label switching-transport profile (MPLS-TP) networks. In the proposed framework, a centralized PCE integrates the service function as well as <b>the</b> path <b>provisioning</b> function into a unified <b>provisioning</b> controller. <b>The</b> service function allows <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> manager to initiate {{the establishment of a}} label-switched path (LSP). <b>The</b> <b>provisioning</b> function computes an optimal path, sets up and maintains the LSP in a unified way while directly configuring the LSP over the switches. The management function, as a separation from <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> function, can fully utilize the MPLS-TP switch to keep monitoring the performance of <b>the</b> <b>provisioned</b> LSP tunnels in a distributed way. The balanced partitioning of service provisioning and management functions reduces traffic load on the controller and improves the scalability. <b>The</b> software-defined <b>provisioning</b> control using an extended PCE communication protocol enables the cooperation between them to monitor and customize the LSPs flexibly and efficiently. We implement and show that the proposed framework not only simplifies <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> procedure with a single instance, but reduces <b>the</b> <b>provisioning</b> time in a MPLS-TP test bed.
