5|$|Epilepsy {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} social and {{psychological}} well-being. These effects may include social isolation, stigmatization, or disability.

The stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families of <b>those</b> <b>with</b> the disorder.|$|E
5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include <b>those</b> <b>with</b> poor coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} poor outcomes at one year), <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a poor ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, poor general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In <b>those</b> <b>with</b> frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In <b>those</b> <b>with</b> benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain.

This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up.

5|$|All <b>those</b> <b>with</b> {{a risk of}} {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given {{to those who are}} not sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. <b>Those</b> <b>with</b> many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in <b>those</b> <b>with</b> pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in <b>those</b> <b>with</b> persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in <b>those</b> <b>with</b> sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
