However, things turn out to be <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true</b> as Hope's Peak Academy's notorious principal, Monokuma, announces they are stuck on the island for life unless they can murder another student and get away with it. If the students can determine a murderer in a Class Trial, that culprit is executed, but if they make the wrong assumption, then the killer walks home free whilst everyone else is sentenced to death.|$|E

[...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> and the old Frank was too evil to be true.

500|$|Titled Return to the Planet of the Apes, {{the project}} was put on fast track and almost entered pre-production. Rick Baker was hired to design the {{prosthetic}} makeup with Danny Elfman composing the film score. Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen were in contention for the lead role. [...] "I can't accurately describe in words the utter euphoria I felt knowing that I, Adam Rifkin, {{was going to be}} resurrecting the Planet of the Apes. It all seemed <b>too</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>true.</b> I soon found out it was." [...] Days before the film was to commence pre-production, new studio executives arrived at Fox, which caused creative differences between Rifkin and the studio. Rifkin was commissioned to rewrite the script through various drafts. The project was abandoned until Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh pitched their own idea, with the apes going through a Renaissance. In the story, the ape government becomes concerned over the new art works, the humans are revolting and the liberal apes shelter a half-human, half-ape from the gorillas. Roddy McDowall was enthusiastic about their proposal and agreed to play the Leonardo da Vinci-type character they had written for him. However, the executive Jackson spoke to was not a fan of the series and seemingly unaware of McDowall's involvement in the series, and Jackson turned his attention back to Heavenly Creatures.|$|E

[...] Writing for The Inquisitr, Daryl Deino praised her vocal performance, saying that she [...] "showed the world once again just what her voice is made of", calling the version [...] "beautiful". Furthermore, Bradley Stern of MuuMuse also applauded the performance, calling [...] "eally great. Super vulnerable, super emotional...and that chilly guitar finish was a wonderful surprise".
