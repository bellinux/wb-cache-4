5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing <b>the</b> <b>offenders,</b> who were now seen as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} arrival of the II Division, the US Navy {{destroyed}} the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. Diederichs detached Gefion to investigate the situation in Manila in an attempt to maneuver Germany into a position to secure colonial possessions in the Philippines, or even to obtain a German prince on the Philippine throne outright. In late March 1899, Gefion was sent to Kiaotschou in response to mistreatment of German missionaries there; Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Franz Grapow went ashore with a landing party of 132marines and artillerymen to punish <b>the</b> <b>offenders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout mid-1835, {{both governments}} {{continued}} their practice of one-upmanship, and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred. Citizens of Monroe County joined {{together in a}} posse to make arrests in Toledo. Partisans from Ohio, angered by the harassment, targeted <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> with criminal prosecutions. Lawsuits were not only rampant, they served {{as a basis for}} retaliatory lawsuits from the opposite side. Partisans from both sides organized spying parties {{to keep track of the}} sheriffs of Wood County, Ohio and Monroe County, Michigan who were entrusted with the security of the border.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] Jesus {{says that}} an {{offended}} person should first draw <b>the</b> <b>offender's</b> fault to <b>the</b> <b>offender's</b> attention privately; then, if <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> refuses to listen, bring {{one or two}} others, {{that there may be}} more than a single witness to the charge; next, if <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> still refuses to listen, bring the matter before the church, and if <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> refuses to listen to the church, treat <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> as [...] "a Gentile and a tax collector".|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> also commits a fresh offense, {{then the}} court, apart from {{sentencing}} <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> for <b>the</b> new offense, should also punish <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> for <b>the</b> original offense.|$|R
50|$|Victims {{meet with}} <b>the</b> board and <b>offender,</b> or submit a written {{statement}} which is shared with <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> and <b>the</b> board.

After the deadline passes, the board submits a compliance report to the court or police, ending the board's involvement.|$|R
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Burchard, {{along with}} Marshal {{and other members}} of the chapter, were often opposed to the actions of their {{archbishop}}. They objected to the archbishop having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom, and to some of the archiepiscopal appointments in the church of York. Burchard and the others charged Geoffrey with simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties and the archbishop in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. The disputes flared up in 1192, with Burchard facing an effort by Geoffrey to replace him in the treasurership with Hamo, but the dispute was resolved by the gift of a church to Hamo by Burchard and Hamo's relinquishing of any claim to the treasurership. At another dispute, Geoffrey had confiscated the revenues of Burchard's offices, along with the revenues of Marshal, Peter de Ros the Archdeacon of Carlisle, and the canons Hugh Murdac and Adam of Thornover. Geoffrey refused to restore the incomes unless <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> came barefoot into York Minster and begged for the archbishop's forgiveness. This all but Marshal did and they had their official revenues restored.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} this {{situation}} might stem from a system that burdens the poor and black in Ferguson. Minor traffic offenses are the starting point, and the costs spiral up rapidly if <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> do not pay the fines on time or do not appear in court. The income from court fines represented the second largest source of revenue for Ferguson in 2013. On October 1, 2014, the city of St. Louis cancelled 220,000 arrest warrants and gave a three-month delay to <b>the</b> <b>offenders</b> {{to get a new}} court date before the warrants would be reissued.|$|E

5000|$|Under certain circumstances, a Youth Court (or other Magistrates Court) must or {{may make}} a {{referral}} to a local youth <b>offender</b> panel. <b>The</b> panel should seek to agree a [...] "contract", a programme of behaviour, with <b>the</b> young <b>offender.</b> If a contract cannot be agreed, <b>the</b> young <b>offender</b> panel refers <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> back to <b>the</b> court.

25|$|After tax collection, law {{enforcement}} and legal disputes occupied {{the most of the}} magistrate's time and energy. Social harmony was paramount.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>offender</b> {{must be held}} accountable, <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> {{must give}} back in the way {{prescribed}} by the victim to make amends. Additionally <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> must also {{give back to the}} community, as crime devalues any community. The community is accountable to the victim by assisting in enforcing any reparations agreed upon by the victim, and to <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> by helping <b>the</b> person avoid committing any more crime. In some cases, it may be difficult for the victim to participate in meetings directly, but the system is based on <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> being brought to face the implications of the crime.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{bullying}} in a nursing workplace, we test the argument that an offender‘s perspective-taking promotes victim conciliation, mediated by perceived perspective-taking, that is, {{the extent to which}} the victim perceives <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> as taking their perspective. Perceived perspective-taking facilitates the attribution of moral emotions (remorse, etc.) to <b>the</b> <b>offender,</b> thereby promoting conciliatory victim responses. However, perceived perspective-taking would be qualified by {{the extent to which the}} severity of consequences expressed in <b>the</b> <b>offender‘s</b> perspective-taking matches or surpasses the severity for the victim. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 141 and 122), victims indicated greater trust and/or forgiveness when <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> had taken <b>the</b> victim‘s perspective. This was sequentially mediated by perceived perspective-taking and victim‘s inference that <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> had felt moral emotions. As predicted, in Study 2 (but not Study 1) severity of consequences qualified victims‘ perceived perspective-taking. Study 3 (N = 138) examined three potential mechanisms for the moderation by severity. Victims attributed greater perspective-taking to <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> when <b>the</b> consequences were less severe than voiced by <b>the</b> <b>offender,</b> suggesting victims‘ appreciation of <b>the</b> <b>offender‘s</b> generous appraisal. Attributions of perspective-taking and of moral emotions to <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> may play an important role in reconciliation processes...|$|R
50|$|While this {{provision}} permits in suitable cases the absolute discharge with admonition of an offender, it provides for other {{cases where the}} court may consider necessary {{in view of the}} circumstances of the case to bind <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> with a bond, with or without sureties, not to commit any offense and to be of good behavior during such period not exceeding a year. If <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> fails to observe any of the conditions of his or her bond, the court can issue a warrant for his or her arrest and can also summon <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> and <b>the</b> sureties. Upon <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> appearing in <b>the</b> court, the court can either remand <b>the</b> <b>offender</b> to judicial custody until the case is heard or admit him or her to bail.
