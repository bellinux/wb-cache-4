40|$|Before {{the recent}} {{collapse}} of a major corporation, a Fortune magazine journalist asked a simple question, “How do you make money? ” In this business there is an equally simple question, “How do you do math? ” Sometimes an assemblage of dimensionless variables {{is presented as a}} case of dimensional analysis, misapplying the Buckingham Pi theorem. The theorem, its usage and its limitations are reviewed in the context of water flow through a dam breach model, taken from a set of measurements of flow through <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>notch</b> in a trapezoidal reservoir embankment made of plywood in a flume...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} project Mannings and Chezys constant were determined and compared using four different notches with different coarse aggregate beds. The coarse aggregates sizes used are 10 mm sized coarse aggregate 20 mm sized coarse aggregate 40 mm sized coarse aggregate and 50 mm sized coarse aggregate. Notches {{that were used}} in this experiment were the rectangular notch <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>notch</b> 90 V-notch and 60 V-notch. The experiment was carried out in the open channel Laboratory by using hydraulic bench It was seen that discharge coefficient varies indirectly with actual discharge. Chezys constant is directly proportional to discharge While Mannings constant in inversely proportional to actual discharge. The Mannings and Chezys roughness coefficient of different aggregate sizes were determined using the various notches. The experimental value of Mannings coefficient with the standard value of aggregates given in Mannings roughness table was evaluated. And also the relationship of Mannings n with flow velocity bed slope and hydraulic radius were studied. The flow rate was measured straightforward since the procedures are obvious. The challenging phenomenon was determination of points where depth develops. The coefficient of resistance is more adaptable and accurate in mannings constant...|$|E
40|$|The {{commonly}} used cross sections of weirs are sharp crested rectangular, trapezoidal and triangular, however; the measurement accuracy of single sharp crested weir is abated {{in areas where}} flows exhibits great variability, i. e. the flow ranging from very low flow in dry conditions to very high flow in extreme rainfall events. In top of that, generally the weirs have the problem of accumulation the sedimentation in the weir pond, so to minimize the disadvantage of weirs, it can be merged with gates (which also have the problem of retaining the floating materials) in one device. The main objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the coefficient of discharge and the characteristics of the free flow for a compound weir (have rectangular notch over triangular notch with <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>notch</b> between them) and semi circular sluice gate of fixed dimensions. Fifteen combined device models were constructed and tested under various geometrical conditions and constant hydraulic conditions. The results show that Cd increases as the hydraulic parameters (H/D, H 1 /D, H 2 /D, H 3 /D) and (W) increases, while the decreasing in Cd values happen at increasing the parameters (Z & Y). The values of Cd range from (0. 358 to 0. 426) with an average value of (0. 392). A general expression were obtained to estimate Cd for the combined device, the estimated values for Cd from the equation plotted agains...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{models for}} the prediction of failure pressures and leak rates under normal operation and design-basis accident conditions in steam generator tubes with axial and circumferential cracks. These models were first validated through failure and leak rate tests at room temperature and at 282 C on tubes with rectangular, triangular, and <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>notches</b> fabricated by electrodischarge machining. They were then compared with failure and leak rate tests conducted on tubes with laboratory-generated outer-diameter stress corrosion cracks and steam generator tubes with field-induced stress corrosion cracks, which have highly complex morphology. Complex crack profiles are addressed using a model based {{on the concept of}} equivalent rectangular cracks. The predictions of the models are in reasonable agreement with test results, the time-dependent initiation and increase of leak rates observed in some tests cannot be predicted by the model...|$|R
25|$|System shingles. Shingles are pre-manufactured {{rectangular}} or square flat tiles for roofs, walls, {{and individual}} building components. They have 1800 folds along all four borders – two folds towards the external side and two towards the internal side. The shingles are interlocked during installation. The fastening is hidden with stainless steel or copper clips on wood sheeting or <b>trapezoidal</b> panels. Machine <b>notching</b> and folding {{ensures that the}} shingles have uniform dimensions. Links to pictoral examples of copper shingles in an exterior and interior environment are available.|$|R
40|$|In 2002 and 2003, the Institute of Nautical Archaeology {{excavated}} {{the remains}} of an East Greek ship that sank {{off the coast of}} Pabu? Burnu, Turkey, sometime {{in the second quarter of}} the sixth century B. C. The scant remains of the vessel?s hull have provided the first archaeological evidence for laced shipbuilding in the Aegean. The diagnostic features preserved in the hull fragments are consistent with those of Greek laced construction, as evidenced in other shipwrecks from the same period found in the western Mediterranean. The planking joinery included edge inserts, or coaks, between the planking strakes and ligatures laced through oblique holes drilled along the sides of the planks through tetrahedral notches. The ship?s framing consisted of pre-fashioned made-frames alternating, on the upper sides of the hull, with top-timbers. The frames had <b>trapezoidal</b> sections, were <b>notched</b> over the planking seams on their underside, and were lashed to the hull. The top-timbers had rectangular sections and were both lashed and treenailed to the planking. Notable in this vessel?s construction is the use of tenons as coaks in its original construction, the earliest example of tenon usage in Greek shipbuilding. The hull?s construction features are virtually identical to those of the Cala Sant Vicen? wreck in Majorca, and mostly similar as well to those of wreck 1 at Gela. The Pabu? Burnu and Cala Sant Vicen? ships are further similar in the use of traditional cylindrical dowel coaks for making repairs to the hull, wherein they are inserted obliquely along one side through the face of the replacement plank. These features testify to a critical phase in Greek shipbuilding when tenons replaced dowels as coaks in laced construction, paving the way for the eventual supplanting of lacing by pegged mortise-and-tenon joinery. Furthermore, examination and comparison of numerous construction details of these and other Greek shipwrecks from the sixth through fourth centuries B. C. suggest that mortise-and-tenon technology could have evolved naturally within the Greek tradition of laced construction, rather than being incorporated directly from some foreign?most likely Phoenician?shipbuilding method...|$|R
