25|$|The {{delay of}} {{hostilities}} {{for ten years}} allowed the free economy of the northern states to continue <b>to</b> <b>industrialize.</b> The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> heavily. By 1860, the northern states had added many more miles of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.|$|E

25|$|As China {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>industrialize,</b> vast {{swaths of}} agricultural land is being converted into industrial land.

25|$|The {{area was}} slowly {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>industrialize,</b> and by 1836 there were factories making flannel and scythes in North Hoosick. Around 1850 Nairn Burgess built the hotel {{on his property}} to fill the demand for lodging, {{as many of the}} workers at the factory were migrants whose families lived elsewhere. It was also a stagecoach stop. A large barn, since demolished, sheltered horses and buggies.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} a {{periphery}} country <b>to</b> <b>industrialize,</b> it must first undergo proto-industrialization. In this stage, a market-based economy begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization also helps to organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more capitalistic. Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, they can begin to build factories and machines.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{intention}} of resolving internal class conflict, the Velasco government determined to lessen Peru's dependency on the outside world. The two most important components of the strategy were a drive to promote rapid industrialization and an attack on the role of foreign firms. In contrast to the industrialization strategies of most other Latin American countries, the intention of the Velasco regime was <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> without welcoming foreign investment.|$|E
25|$|In cities {{during the}} Great Leap, {{there was an}} {{emphasis}} on collective use of public space even for activities that had usually {{taken place in the}} home. For example, entire neighborhoods were required to eat their dinner in public dining halls. Ultimately, the Great Leap Forward proved disastrous, failing <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> effectively and causing famine due to labor shortages on farms. In 1962, the government began allowing people to move back to farms.|$|E
25|$|The 1850s were {{a period}} of extreme {{political}} reaction. Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following {{the collapse of the}} 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholy during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated clericalism and absolute divine monarchy. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.|$|E

25|$|An {{experimental}} commune {{was established}} in Henan early in 1958, and soon communes spread throughout the country. Tens of millions were mobilised to produce a single commodity that was symbolic of industrialisation—steel. Approximately 25,000 communes were set up, each with around 5,000 households. The hope was <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> by making use of the massive supply of cheap labor and avoid having to import heavy machinery. Small backyard steel furnaces were built in every commune where peasants produced small nuggets of cast iron made from scrap metal. Simultaneously, peasants communities were collectivised.|$|E
25|$|The {{territory}} of Ukraine was a battlefield during the World War II, and its population, including Russians, significantly decreased. The infrastructure was heavily damaged and it required human and capital resources to be rebuilt. This compounded with depopulation caused by two famines of 1931–1932 {{and a third}} in 1947 to leave the territory with a greatly reduced population. A {{large portion of the}} wave of new migrants <b>to</b> <b>industrialize,</b> integrate and Sovietize the recently acquired western Ukrainian territories were ethnic Russians who mostly settled around industrial centers and military garrisons. This increased the proportion of the Russian speaking population.|$|E
25|$|By the mid 1900s, after Mexico started <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> and modernize, the {{consumption}} of pulque and the popularity of pulquerias had greatly declined. This {{is directly related to}} the increase in production and popularity of beer in Mexico. As factories established themselves and migrant workers started to come into Mexico, the beer industry greatly expand and beer soon replaced pulque as the alcoholic drink of choice. The popularity of pulquerias declined as they were seen as a thing of the past. By the 1930s, there was a steep reduction in the number of pulquerias in Mexico City, and today there are very few of them left.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consequence}} was {{the privatization}} of communal properties {{that had belonged to}} the municipalities. Many farmers were deprived of resources on which they depended for survival (e.g., firewood and pastures), which fueled the emigration of the rural population <b>to</b> <b>industrialized</b> areas of the country or to the Americas. This migration reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R

25|$|Under {{the empire}} and republic, however, the town slowly began <b>to</b> <b>industrialize.</b> In 1873, Brazil's first elevator, the {{powerful}} hydraulic , was constructed {{to connect the}} city's upper and lower towns. Having undergone several upgrades, it continues in use. By the First World War, it was joined by a second elevator and Salvador was connected to four railroads: the Bahia & Alagoinhas to Joazeiro, the Bahia Central, the Nazareth Tramway, and a short line to Santo Amaro. Its central districts and the major suburbs of Bomsim and Victoria were served by four streetcar lines, which had begun to electrify. It {{also served as a}} port of call for most steamship lines trading between Europe and South America.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the dawn}} of filmmaking, the U.S. major film studios have {{dominated}} both American cinema and the global film industry. U.S. studios have benefited from a strong first-mover advantage in {{that they were the}} first <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> filmmaking and master the art of mass-producing and distributing high-quality films with broad cross-cultural appeal. Today, the Big Six majors routinely distribute hundreds of films every year into all significant international markets (that is, where discretionary income is high enough for consumers to afford to watch films). It is very rare, if not impossible, for a film to reach a broad international audience on multiple continents and in multiple languages without first being picked up by one of the majors for distribution.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's {{transformation}} into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly. The population grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901. The economy, long based on agriculture, began <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> after 1790. At first the leading industry, {{based in the}} west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. In 1861 the American Civil War suddenly cut off the supplies of raw cotton and the industry never recovered. Thanks to its many entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, Scotland became a world centre for engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.|$|E
50|$|The 1973 {{oil crisis}} marked {{a halt to}} the growth of {{synthetic}} rubber production; the expansion of existing plants almost ceased for a few years. Since then, the construction of new plants have been mainly focused <b>to</b> <b>industrializing</b> countries in the Far East (such as South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and China), while Western countries have chosen to increase the capacity of existing plants.|$|R

25|$|The economy {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> and urbanize, {{with heavy}} industry – especially coal and steel – becoming {{important in the}} Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia. Perkins (1981) argues that more important than Bismarck's new tariff on imported grain was {{the introduction of the}} sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{traditional}} {{economy was}} based around sugarcane plantations. By {{the middle of}} the twentieth century it remained one of the poorest in the Caribbean. In 1947 newly elected Puerto Rican governor Luis Muñoz Marín of the Popular Democratic Party along with the United States government began Operation Bootstrap, which invested millions of dollars into the Puerto Rican <b>to</b> <b>industrialize</b> the island's economy. Based on 1930s New Deal economic relief reforms and infrastructure provided by the programs such as the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, Operation Bootstrap intended to move Puerto Rico away from its agrarian system and into an industrial economy. The government's Administration of Economic Development —today known as the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (PRIDCO)— encouraged the establishment of factories.|$|E
25|$|One main way {{in which}} a {{periphery}} country can rise to semi-periphery or core status is through the stabilization of its government. A country with a dictatorship type government is much easier to exploit and corrupt than one with a well organized, elected government and core countries use this to their advantage. Political unrest is usually a cause for military action from the core countries in order to protect their interests and keep a cooperative dictator or government in power. Once the citizens of these countries become exploited enough, they can stage a coup in order to overthrow their government and put someone who they feel will help the country into power. If this is done successfully and the new leader is stays true to his/her word, the country can take the next necessary step in rising from periphery status and that is to start <b>to</b> <b>industrialize.</b>|$|E
