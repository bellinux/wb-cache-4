25|$|Until {{as late as}} 1939, {{women in}} the ceramic {{industry}} in Britain were mostly confined to decorating, since they were thought to have special aptitude for repetitive detailed work. The trades' unions did what they could <b>to</b> <b>handicap</b> women even in these occupations, for example refusing {{to allow them to}} use hand rests. Often the women were used for subordinate tasks such as filling in outlines or adding decorative sprigs.|$|E
25|$|There was {{stalemate}} for a year. By 1944, the Allied {{forces in}} India had been reinforced and had expanded their logistic infrastructure, {{which made it}} possible for them to contemplate an attack into Burma. The Japanese attempted to forestall them by an invasion of India, which led to a heavy Japanese defeat at the Battle of Imphal, and other setbacks in Northern Burma. Their losses were <b>to</b> <b>handicap</b> their defence of Burma in the following year.|$|E
25|$|The fixture {{survived and}} managed to {{struggle}} through the 1820s and 1830s when it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>handicap</b> the Players to give the Gentlemen a competitive chance. It became annual (often played more than once per season) from 1829. The teams were evenly matched in the early 1840s when Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix were in the Gentlemen team but then, of the 25 matches from July 1844 to July 1865, the Players won 23 with one draw and only one defeat. In 1865, W. G. Grace came into the Gentlemen team and the picture changed completely with the Gentlemen dominant for the next twenty years. From the mid-1880s, the batsmen on each side were usually strong but {{the hallmark of the}} Players from that time became their greater strength in bowling and fielding, areas in which the Gentlemen were relatively weak after Grace was past his best.|$|E

2500|$|The special {{election}} was initially {{thought to be}} a [...] "certain victory" [...] for the Republican candidate, but became [...] "fiercely competitive", according to The New York Times, because of a U.S. House Republican plan to privatize Medicare. The Times has also cited the candidacy of third party candidate Davis as a factor which is [...] "siphoning support" [...] from Corwin.

2500|$|An {{investment}} {{group led by}} William DeWitt, Jr. owns the St. Louis Cardinals, having bought the team from Anheuser-Busch (AB) in 1996. [...] As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed {{as to whether the}} purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a [...] "small market", which appear <b>to</b> <b>handicap</b> a club's competitiveness. [...] Such was the case when Sam Breadon put the Cardinals up for sale in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick proposed moving the Cardinals to Chicago. [...] When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis. [...] In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Hanser and DeWitt, Jr. [...] Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group. [...] Baur's group then sold the garages to another {{investment group}}, lowering the net franchise purchase price to about $100 million, about $10 million less than Financial World's value of the team at the time $110 million.|$|E

He also joined the NWA {{on a major}} tour of New Zealand in 1983. He was among the many foreign wrestlers {{to appear on the}} country's long-running wrestling programme On the Mat and whose opponents included Lars Anderson, Mark Lewin, Curt Kummala and Steve Rickard. He initially arrived as a [...] "heel" [...] wrestler, offering $1000 to anyone who could bodyslam him and challenged local wrestlers <b>to</b> <b>handicap</b> matches, but later [...] "turned face" [...] to feud with the Mongols, Zar & Gor. One of his most memorable matches from this period was a 6-man tag team match with Ricky Rickard and Mark Lewin against Butcher Branigan, Jos LeDuc & [...] "Brutal" [...] Bob Miller. While in New Zealand, the 24-year-old Link and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair celebrated their birthdays together, Flair's 34th birthday being three days before his, along with Steve Rickard. Link also worked in Tonga, Samoa and Hawaii for Lia Maivia during his New Zealand tour. The King of Tonga, Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, was in attendance during one of his matches. Years later, Link became the first wrestler to appear in New Zealand cartoonist Jason Conlan's [...] "On The Mat" [...] comic strip for Pro Wrestling Illustrated. He was also interviewed by Kiwi Pro Wrestling, one of New Zealand's three major wrestling companies, which was later posted on their website.|$|E

2500|$|In effect, {{the method}} {{produces}} groups of voters of equal size {{that reflect the}} diversity of the electorate, each group having a representative the group voted for. [...] Some 90% of voters have a representative to whom they gave their first preference. [...] Voters can choose candidates using any criteria they wish, the proportionality is implicit. [...] Political parties are not necessary; all other prominent PR electoral systems presume that parties reflect voters wishes, which many believe gives power to parties. [...] STV satisfies the electoral system criterion proportionality for solid coalitions a solid coalition for a set of candidates is the group of voters that rank all those candidates above all others and is therefore considered a system of proportional representation. [...] However, the small district magnitude used in STV elections has been criticized as impairing proportionality, especially when more parties compete than there are seats available, and STV has, for this reason, sometimes been labelled [...] "quasi proportional". [...] While this may be true when considering districts in isolation, results [...] are proportional. [...] In Ireland, with particularly small magnitudes, results are [...] "highly proportional". [...] In 1997, the average magnitude was 4.0 but eight parties gained representation, four of them with less than 3% of first preference votes nationally. [...] Six independent candidates also won election. [...] STV has also been described as the [...] proportional system. [...] The system tends <b>to</b> <b>handicap</b> extreme candidates because, to gain preferences and so improve their chance of election, candidates need to canvass voters beyond their own circle of supporters, and so need to moderate their views. [...] Conversely, widely respected candidates can win election with relatively few first preferences by benefitting from strong subordinate preference support.|$|E
