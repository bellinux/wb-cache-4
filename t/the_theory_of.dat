5|$|According to Karl Potter {{and other}} scholars, Hinduism {{developed}} various theory of relations such as satkaryavada, asatkaryavada, avirodhavada and others. The anekantavada overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The Anekantavada doctrine is satkaryavada in explaining causes, and the asatkaryavada in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects. The different schools of Hindu philosophy further elaborated and refined <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> pramanas and <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.|$|E
