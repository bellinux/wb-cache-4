5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating <b>them</b> <b>was</b> a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
