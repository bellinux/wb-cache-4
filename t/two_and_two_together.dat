2500|$|Susie Greene (Susie Essman) – Jeff's shrill but {{ultimately}} good-hearted wife, {{known for her}} explosive temper and her filthy mouth. Consequently, her reactions to Larry range from near violence via benign grievances to occasionally fonder repartee. Able to put <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>together,</b> she frequently catches Larry and Jeff in plans gone awry or cover-up of [...] some misbehavior. She routinely berates Larry and Jeff with profanity-laced tirades after uncovering one of their schemes. Susie and Jeff have an [...] "on-again, off-again" [...] relationship. She often uses Larry as a scapegoat for her marital problems. She is known to refer to Larry as [...] "Larry Fucking David" [...] and [...] "Four-Eyed Fuck," [...] and when he crosses her, she is known to respond [...] "Fuck you, Larry David!" [...] while her common expletive to her husband is [...] "You fat piece of shit!" [...] She often serves to enforce traditional moral standards, such as the sanctity of marital vows and fealty to hearth and home, at times versus her husband, at others versus Larry, and usually versus both. Susie Essman was upgraded from guest star billing to main cast billing beginning with season eight.|$|E
2500|$|One {{persistent}} account about Camille {{states that}} 23 people held a [...] "hurricane party" [...] {{on the third}} floor of the Richelieu Manor Apartments in Pass Christian, Mississippi, in the path of the eyewall as it made landfall. The high storm surge flooded and destroyed the building, killing all but one person. Who the survivor is, how many party guests there were, and just how far the sole survivor was swept by the storm varies with the retelling. An ABC made-for-TV movie called Hurricane, starring Frank Sutton of Gomer Pyle USMC, Larry Hagman, Patrick Duffy, Will Geer, Martin Milner, and Michael Learned, was loosely based on the supposed hurricane party. However, the site and names were changed to fictitious ones for the movie, as was the name of the hurricane. The television show Quantum Leap carried an episode regarding the parties of Hurricane Camille and the actual hurricane itself. Twenty-three people are known to have stayed in the Richelieu Apartments during the hurricane, eight of whom died. The tale of the lone survivor and the party appears to have originated with survivor Mary Ann Gerlach. Survivor Ben Duckworth has expressed irritation at the story. There was no hurricane party. Duckworth reiterated in 2001. We were exhausted from boarding up windows and helping the police move cars. We were too tired to party. I can’t tell you why that story persists, or why people didn't put <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>together.</b> I guess the hurricane party makes a good story.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine which of three modes of instruction controlling the °density " of simulation training was most effective in terms of transfer and most efficient {{in terms of the}} learning rate of preservice teachers. Four goals of the classroom simulation were identified and practiced in three training modes: (1) four at a time, the simultaneous mode; (2) <b>two</b> separately <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>together,</b> the combination mode; (3) one at a time, the successive mode. The subjects, undergraduate students in elementary education at Oregon College of Education and University of Oregon in 1965 - 66 and 1966 - 67, were randomly assigned to the three treatments, and data was obtained from simulation pre-. post-, and retention tests <b>and</b> from <b>two</b> classroom evaluations of subsequent student teaching behavior. The conclusion after analyses of variance was that the simultaneous method was more efficient. Data revealed no significant interaction of cognitive and personality factors with training modes, but this exploratory phase of the research was limited (as was the total effort) by methodological and conceptual problems.

5|$|The British Government {{ordered a}} total of four prototypes (<b>two</b> F-4K <b>and</b> <b>two</b> F-4M), <b>together</b> with a pair of {{pre-production}} F-4K aircraft. The first UK Phantom, a prototype F-4K (designated YF-4K), first flew on 27 June 1966 at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St. Louis. The second made its first flight on 30 August 1966. The two pre-production F-4K aircraft were constructed alongside the prototypes, and were initially used for fit check trials of the various systems to be fitted – the first was used for catapult/arrestor and deck landing trials, and the second was primarily for testing the radar and missile systems. All four were delivered to the UK from 1969 to 1970 for continued test work by both the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment and British Aerospace. One of the pre-production examples was subsequently delivered to the RAF for operational use, but was lost in 1978. The first F-4M prototype (designated YF-4M) first flew on 17 February 1967, and was also used for fit checks before delivery to the UK.|$|R

The eldest daughter of Father Chen (from his first marriage) lived in a nearby town (40  min by bus) where her children studied at the local middle school. The second daughter lived in the nearby town and made a living from street vending; the youngest daughter lived in a nearby city (90  min by coach) and owned a small fruit shop. Father Chen and Mother Chen felt strongly that education would enable people born in the countryside to lead a better life. However, with the exception of their youngest son who had eventually joined a military academy, all of Father Chen’s children only finished junior middle school (approximately 9  years of education).|$|R

To clear their way, Üchritz sent two {{companies}} of the Vilmos-hussars {{together with the}} 9th cavalry battery. The hussars, led by Captain Wladyslaw Dzwonkowski, advanced slowly and when they observed the uhlans, who were north-east of the cemetery, attacked them, {{but because of the}} deep and wide trench, they could hurdle with their horses only one by one, so the uhlans waited them {{on the other side of}} the trenches and stabbed many of them to death with their lances. Then the uhlans attacked the Hussars, chasing them away, while another three platoons were sent to the uhlans' aid. In the skirmish also Captain Wladyslaw Dzwonkowski was killed. Three new uhlan platoons arrived, and attacked the Hungarian hussars from the sides, who just before were strengthened by a company of the Vilmos-hussars, and led by this started a counterattack. As a result of this, the Hussars were forced to retreat again, both sides suffering great losses, augmented by the Hungarian cavalry battery which, during this time, shot permanently the uhlans. Then another 6 uhlan platoons arrived, with <b>two</b> cannons <b>and</b> <b>two</b> rockets, <b>together</b> with the Baden infantry.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of adapting the methods developed by Martins and Sakima to assess skeletal maturation by cervical vertebrae in the pubertal growth spurt (PGS) curve. It also aimed to test the reliability and agreement between those methods and the method of hand and wrist radiograph when compared <b>two</b> by <b>two</b> <b>and</b> all <b>together.</b> METHODS: The sample comprised 72 radiographs, with 36 lateral radiographs of the head and 36 hand-wrist radiographs of 36 subjects with Down's syndrome (DS), 13 female and 23 male, aged between 8 years and 6 months and 18 years and 7 months, with an average age of 13 years and 10 months. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results revealed that adapting the methods developed by Martins and Sakima to assess skeletal maturation by cervical vertebrae in the curve of PGS is practical and useful in determining the stage of growth and development of individuals. The stages of maturation evaluated by cervical vertebrae and ossification centers observed in radiographs of the hand and wrist were considered reliable, with excellent level of agreement between the methods by Hassel and Farman as well as Baccetti, Franchi and McNamara Jr and Martins and Sakima. Additionally, results revealed an agreement that ranged between reasonable to good for the three methods used to assess the skeletal maturation, showing statistical significance...|$|R
