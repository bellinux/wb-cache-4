500|$|Universal {{appealed the}} verdict to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Nintendo and Universal argued the appeals case on May 23, 1984. As {{evidence}} of consumer confusion, Universal presented {{the results of}} a telephone survey of 150 managers and owners of arcades, bowling alleys, and pizza restaurants who owned or leased Donkey Kong machines. To the question [...] "To <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> knowledge, was the Donkey Kong game made with the approval or under the authority of the people who produce the King Kong movies?", 18% of those surveyed answered in the affirmative. However, to the question [...] "As far as you know, who makes Donkey Kong?", no one named Universal. Universal argued that this was enough evidence to show that consumers were confused about the distinction between the two names.|$|E

His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{production}} from Sayers, the Bears {{as a whole}} struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers' main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East's attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season's game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the [...] "back of the game", an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. [...] "The Pro Bowl {{is the time to}} prove how good you are, playing against <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> peers," [...] recalled Sayers. [...] "I took it as a challenge. I came into the game in shape, came to play." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1948 Mitford {{completed}} a new novel, {{a sequel to}} The Pursuit of Love she called Love in a Cold Climate, with the same country house ambience as the earlier book {{and many of the}} same characters. The novel's reception was even warmer than that of its predecessor; Waugh {{was one of the few}} critics to qualify his praise—he thought the descriptions were good but the conversations poor. In 1950 she translated and adapted André Roussin's play La petite hutte ("The Little Hut"), in preparation for its successful West End début in August, The Timess critic noted the [...] "habit of speech at once colloquial and unexpected which instantly declares itself the creation of Miss Mitford." [...] The play ran for 1,261 performances, and provided Mitford with a steady £300 per month in royalties. The same year The Sunday Times asked her to contribute a regular column, which she did for four years. This busy period in her writing life continued in 1951 with her third postwar novel, The Blessing, another semi-autobiographical romance this time set in Paris, in which an aristocratic young Englishwoman is married to a libidinous French marquis. Harold Acton deems it her most accomplished novel, [...] "permeated with her joyous love of France". This time Waugh (to whom the book was dedicated) had no criticism; he found the book [...] "admirable, deliciously funny, consistent and complete, by far <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> writings".|$|E

[...] However, it {{is a time}} when the gods have lost their purpose; Jupiter is {{interested}} only in eating and drinking; Horus thinks of nothing except his pyramids; and Ch'ih-yu simply wants to eat livestock. The story begins with HE, the [...] "Unknown God", and creator of all gods, summoning the lesser gods to HIM, and telling them [...] "for eons, you think only of pleasure, and now even the lowliest men say, [...] "these drunks don't do anything for us. Let's go over their heads to the boss"." [...] HE is afraid this will lead to monotheism, which HE wants to avoid, as HE has neither the time nor inclination to govern all of humanity himself. As a result, HE commands each of them [...] "to pick one who is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> people," [...] and have him lead a war against the other two peoples. The two gods whose people lose will be punished by repainting the universe white. Jupiter picks Septimus Marius, a sea merchant; Horus picks Ramadamses, a sculptor; and Ch'ih-yu picks Tsu-Tang, a rice farmer.|$|E
2500|$|Norwegian singer Sondre Lerche covered [...] "Countdown" [...] in December 2011 as a [...] "Christmas gift" [...] and his {{favorite}} {{song of the}} year. He further stated, [...] "I took the liberty of making some gender-oriented changes to the lyrics to better accommodate my macho-persona... That being said, {{the trick is to}} get passed the novelty-factor and just sing a beautiful song at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> abilities. Obviously, a significant part of this song's appeal and ecstatic energy comes from the dizzying vocal performance and the mind-blowingly cool production work — elements and talents useless to even attempt replicating (especially not in my father in-law's basement). But as long as there's a song underneath, there's a way." [...] His cover of the song contains his vocals and mild acoustic guitar strumming, which according to Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine gives [...] "an approach that puts the focus on the track's stellar songwriting". According to Mallika Rao of The Huffington Post, [...] "Sondre Lerche made us a gift... and probably because he's a talented, popular, professional musician, it's really good". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the cover, saying: [...] "The end result is a simple track, without pomp or circumstance or the crazy marching band, where Lerche is able to replicate not the high-energy feel, but the song's simple message of love and dedication. Thanks to its minimalist nature, the track isn't a corny display of pop mockery, but a demonstration of how universal great music can be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The slogan [...] "Free a Marine to Fight" [...] {{proved to}} be a strong drawing card for the WR, {{stronger}} than any fashioned by the WAC, Waves, or SPARS. Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Tailor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: [...] "Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and do your job to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ability." [...] And there were those parents who asked special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the WR. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat and 18-year-old girls could not even serve. Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the WR. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which asked this question. The results of this survey showed that the 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a broken marriage, boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings. The WR met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944, and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944, but on a limited basis. The peak strength was 17,640 enlisted and 820 officers.|$|E
