40|$|We {{observed}} the Saturn-mass and Jupiter-sized exoplanet HAT-P- 19 b to refine its transit parameters and ephemeris {{as well as}} to shed first light on its transmission spectrum. We monitored the host star over one year to quantify its flux variability and to correct the transmission spectrum for a slope caused by starspots. A transit of HAT-P- 19 b was observed spectroscopically with OSIRIS at the Gran Telescopio Canarias in January 2012. The spectra of the target and the comparison star covered the wavelength range from 5600 to 7600 AA. One high-precision differential light curve was created by integrating the entire spectral flux. This white-light curve was used to derive absolute transit parameters. Furthermore, a set of light curves over wavelength was formed by a flux integration in 41 wavelength channels of 50 AA width. We analyzed these spectral light curves for chromatic variations of transit depth. The <b>transit</b> <b>fit</b> of the combined white-light curve yields a refined value of the planet-to-star radius ratio of 0. 1390 pm 0. 0012 and an inclination of 88. 89 pm 0. 32 degrees. After a re-analysis of published data, we refine the orbital period to 4. 0087844 pm 0. 0000015 days. We obtain a flat transmission spectrum without significant additional absorption at any wavelength or any slope. However, our accuracy is not sufficient to significantly rule out the presence of a pressure-broadened sodium feature.

The system's parameters, announced by the Kepler team and subsequently used in further research, were based on only 5 months of data. We have reanalyzed this system using the full span of 29 months of Kepler photometric data, and obtained improved information about its star and the planets. A detailed asteroseismic analysis of the extended time series provides a significant improvement on the stellar parameters: Not only can we state that Kepler- 10 is the oldest known rocky-planet-harboring system at 10. 41 +/- 1. 36 Gyr, but these parameters combined with improved planetary parameters from new <b>transit</b> <b>fits</b> gives us the radius of Kepler- 10 b to within just 125 km.

The systematics- corrected, variability-detrended light curves are searched for transits with the Box Least Squares method, and a period-dependent detection threshold is used to generate a prelimi- nary candidate list.

K 2 - 26 is an M 1. 0 +/- 0. 5 dwarf at 93 ± 7 pc from K 2 Campaign 0.

K 2 - 26 b exhibits a transit duration that is too long {{to be consistent with}} a circular orbit given its measured stellar radius.

The 2. 5 min binned phase-folded light curve is affected by the effect of sucessive occultations of stellar active regions by the planet, and the dispersion in the out of transit part reaches a level of 1. 09 × 10 [SUP]- 4 [/SUP] in flux units. Results: We derive a radius for the planet of 1. 465 ± 0. 029 R_Jup and a mass of 3. 31 ± 0. 16 M_Jup, corresponding to a density of 1. 31 ± 0. 04 g/cm^ 3. The large radius of CoRoT-Exo- 2 b cannot be explained by current models of evolution of irradiated planets.

40|$|Context. We {{present a}} new primary transit {{observation}} of the hot-jupiter HD 189733 b, obtained at 3. 6 μm with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3. 6 microns suffered from strong systematics, and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on the water detection by comparison of the 3. 6 and 5. 8 microns observations. Aims. We aim at constraining the atmospheric structure and composition of the planet and improving previously derived parameters. Methods. We use a high-S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3. 6 μm. The observation has been performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode. We are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the <b>transit</b> from the <b>fits</b> of the <b>transit</b> light curve. We compare the results with transmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations at the same wavelength. Results.

40|$|We {{measure the}} mass and {{radius of the}} star and planet in the TrES- 2 system using 2. 7 years of {{observations}} by the Kepler spacecraft. The light curve shows evidence for ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming on a period consistent with the orbital period of the planet with amplitudes of 2. 79 [superscript + 0. 44] [subscript – 0. 62] and 3. 44 [superscript + 0. 32] [subscript – 0. 37] parts per million (ppm), respectively, and {{a difference between the}} dayside and the nightside planetary flux of 3. 41 [superscript + 0. 55] [subscript – 0. 82] ppm. We present an asteroseismic analysis of solar-like oscillations on TrES- 2 A which we use to calculate the stellar mass of 0. 94 ± 0. 05 M [subscript ☉] and radius of 0. 95 ± 0. 02 R [subscript ☉]. Using these stellar parameters, a <b>transit</b> model <b>fit</b> and the phase-curve variations, we determine the planetary radius of 1. 162 [superscript + 0. 020] [subscript – 0. 024] R[subscript Jup] and derive a mass for TrES- 2 b from the photometry of 1. 44 ± 0. 21 M [subscript Jup]. The ratio of the ellipsoidal variation to the Doppler beaming amplitudes agrees to better than 2 σ with theoretical predications, while our measured planet mass and radius agree within 2 σ of previously published values based on spectroscopic radial velocity measurements. We measure a geometric albedo of 0. 0136 [superscript + 0. 0022] [subscript – 0. 0033] and an occultation (secondary eclipse) depth of 6. 5 [superscript + 1. 7] [subscript – 1. 8] ppm which we combined with the day/night planetary flux ratio to model the atmosphere of TrES- 2 b. We find that an atmosphere model that contains a temperature inversion is strongly preferred.

Transit observations in the mid-IR allow the atmospheric content of transiting planets to be determined. We present new primary transit observations of the hot-jupiter HD 189733 b, obtained simultaneously at 4. 5 and 8 micron with IRAC instrument onboard Spitzer. Together with a new refined analysis of previous observations at 3. 6 and 5. 8 micron using the same instrument, we are able to derive the system parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the <b>transit</b> from <b>fits</b> of the <b>transit</b> light curves at these four wavelengths. We measure the four planet-to-star radius ratios, to be (R_p/R_*) = 0. 1545 +/- 0. 0003, 0. 1557 +/- 0. 0003, 0. 1547 +/- 0. 0005, 0. 1544 +/- 0. 0004 at 3. 6, 4. 5, 5. 8, and 8 micron respectively. The high accuracy of the measurement allows the search for atmospheric molecular absorbers. Contrary to a previous analysis of the same dataset, our study is robust against systematics and reveals that water vapor absorption at 5. 8 micron is not detected in this photometric dataset. Furthermore, in the band centered around 4. 5 micron we find a hint of excess absorption with an apparent planetary radius Delta(R_p/R_*) = 0. 00128 +/- 0. 00056 larger (2. 3 sigma) than the one measured simultaneously at 8 micron. This value is 4 sigma above what would be expected for an atmosphere where water vapor is the only absorbing species in the near infrared. This shows that an additional species absorbing around 4. 5 micron could be present in the atmosphere. CO being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H 2 O ratio between 5 and 60.

MINERVA employs a robotic array of four 0. 7 -m telescopes outfitted for both high-resolution spectroscopy and photometry, and is designed for completely autonomous operation. The primary science program is a dedicated radial velocity survey and the secondary science objective is to obtain high-precision transit light curves. The modular design of the facility and the flexibility of our hardware allows for both science programs to be pursued simultaneously, while the robotic control software provides a robust and efficient means to carry out nightly observations. We describe the design of MINERVA, including major hardware components, software, and science goals. The telescopes and photometry cameras are characterized at our test facility on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California, and their on-sky performance is validated.

Atmospheric models for these planets predict that the strongest spectrophotometric features of those molecules are located at wavelengths ranging from 1 to 10 μm making this region of particular interest. Consequently, transit observations in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) allow the atmospheric content of transiting planets to be determined.

The search {{includes}} a total of 198, 709 stellar targets, of which 112, 046 were observed in all 17 quarters and 86, 663 in fewer than 17 quarters. We report on 17, 230 targets for which at least one transit signature is identified that meets the specified detection criteria: periodicity, minimum of three observed transit events, detection statistic (i. e., signal-to-noise ratio) {{in excess of the}} search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit consistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are iteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting planet model is fitted to the data and transit events are removed. The search for additional planets adds 16, 802 transit signals for a total of 34, 032; this far exceeds the number of transit signatures identified in prior pipeline runs. There was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final Kepler transit search.

We used APOSTLE r-band lightcurves {{in conjunction}} with previously gathered data of GJ 1214 b to re-derive system parameters. By using parameters such as transit duration and ingress/egress length we are able to reduce the degeneracies between parameters in the <b>fitted</b> <b>transit</b> model, which is a preferred condition for Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques typically used to quantify uncertainties in measured parameters. The joint analysis of this multi-wavelength dataset confirms earlier estimates of system parameters including planetary orbital period, the planet-to-star radius ratio and stellar density. We fit the photometric spectralenergy distribution of GJ 1214 to derive stellar luminosity, which we then use to derive its absolute mass and radius. From these derived stellar properties and previously published radial velocity data we were able to refine estimates of the absolute parameters for the planet GJ 1214 b. Transit times derived from our study show no evidence for strong transit timing variations. Some lightcurves we present show features that we believe are due to stellar activity. During the first night we observed a rise in the out-of-eclipse flux of GJ 1214 with a characteristic fast-rise exponential decay shape commonly associated with stellar flares.
