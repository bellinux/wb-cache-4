5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, {{and that it would}} be instructive <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> each taxon responds to the calls of the other.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as dog or cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E

5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the electric grid if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between genes {{can be measured}} by comparing the sequence alignment of their DNA. The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called conserved sequence. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes {{can be used for}} phylogenetic analyses <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E
50|$|Centipede {{mathematics}} {{is a term}} used, sometimes derogatorily, to describe the generalisation and study of mathematical objects satisfying progressively fewer and fewer restrictions. This type of <b>study</b> is likened <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> a centipede behaves when its legs are removed one by one.|$|R
50|$|None of {{the methods}} of {{identifying}} b-jets are foolproof, and modern particle physics experiments must devote significant time <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> often they successfully identify b-jets and how often they misidentify other jets. Monte Carlo simulations are used to develop and evaluate the performance of tagging algorithms.|$|R
30|$|Machine learning, on {{the other}} hand, is {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>how</b> computers simulate or implement human learning behavior, learning by analyzing large amounts of data, finding patterns in the data, and using these patterns to make predictions in order to acquire new knowledge or skills. Association rule mining is an algorithm for discovering association knowledge in machine learning.|$|R
5|$|The {{wealth of}} Allosaurus fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows {{scientists}} <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> the animal grew {{and how long}} its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggsâ€”crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of Allosaurus. Based on histological analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28years, which is {{comparable to that of}} other large theropods like Tyrannosaurus. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150kilograms (330lb) per year.|$|E
5|$|This National War Museum Committee {{set about}} {{collecting}} material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, {{the production of}} munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation {{of the need for}} exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>how</b> best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.|$|E

The Makah have also recreated the drying processes and fishing methods used by the ancient Hoko fishermen. In one such experiment, the Makah aided archeologists in creating reproductions of fishing equipment, such as hooks dating from 2500-3000 B.P.

25|$|Chromatophores are {{sometimes}} used in applied research.

Chromatophore biology has also been used to model human condition or disease, including melanoma and albinism. Recently, the gene responsible for the melanophore-specific golden zebrafish strain, Slc24a5, was shown to have a human equivalent that strongly correlates with skin colour.|$|E

The science team discovered that the sedimentâ€™s minerals dehydrated before reaching the subduction zone, resulting in a strong fault that allowed for a larger than previously expected earthquake to occur.|$|R
