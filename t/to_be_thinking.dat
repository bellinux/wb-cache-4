5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

The Oracle of Time is then revealed to be the living consciousness of Norma Cenva, somehow also still in existence millennia after the Jihad.|$|E

She {{explained}} the idea came to mind when her friends were worried about her being silent: [...] "My girlfriend told me 'You don't realize how loud you are when you are quiet'." [...] She {{felt that it was}} [...] "typical" [...] of her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> and [...] "deciding what was wrong" [...] because she felt that things in her head [...] "were not clear." ...|$|E

[...] When playing for Shannon, he insisted on the highest standards, {{and even though he}} was not captain, he would take over if the game was going against his team. James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others: [...] "His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when he seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of other things, far removed." ...|$|E
500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E

500|$|During {{his second}} run for president, Reagan's {{campaign}} advisor, George Will, tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] for the campaign. Will wrote that if [...] "labor and management, who make steel or cars or shoes or textiles, made their products {{with as much}} energy and confidence as Springsteen and his merry band make music, {{there would be no}} need for Congress <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about protectionism". A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey. Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellancamp to use his song [...] "Pink Houses" [...] and were turned down. The campaign then adopted [...] "God Bless the U.S.A." [...] by country singer Lee Greenwood. Greenwood played the song for the Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at the inaugurations of the next three Republican presidents.|$|E
500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E

The writer also criticised Furtado's discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of feminism in a Blender magazine interview, writing: [...] "Girls, do you hear that churning? Those are the ideas of Gloria Steinem turning in their grave." [...] A writer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that cynics could attribute Furtado's commercial success with Loose to her [...] "amped-up sex appeal." [...] The writer added that, the failure of Janet Jackson's album Damita Jo (2004) indicated such a move was not infallible. Furtado was [...] "still demure compared to many of her competitors"—she avoided sporting lingerie or performing [...] "Christina Aguilera-style gyrations or calisthenics" [...] in the [...] "Promiscuous" [...] and [...] "Maneater" [...] videos. [...] "Despite its dramatic arrival ... Furtado's new image doesn’t feel calculated", he said.

500|$|British singer, Rita Ora, plays Drake's distant love {{interest}} in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video {{in front of a}} gray backdrop, as he seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed as dangerous as she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "artistically contradictory", however said that the scenes of Drake sitting [...] "alone in his bedroom as flashing images of busy streets and crowds of strangers float around him, pensive and rebellious", and called them [...] "controlled chaos", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that [...] "He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers", and that he stuck with [...] "one leading lady".|$|E
500|$|Six {{years have}} passed, {{and it is}} 1893. Gaylord and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a {{precarious}} living from Gaylord's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life, singing the song [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Gaylord abandons [...] Magnolia and Kim. [...] Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song [...] "Bill." [...] She appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing [...] "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" [...] for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected." [...] but also that Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein [...] "Did not want to dis the Cardinals." [...] Shaughnessy also quoted Schilling as having said: [...] "There's a lot of good players in that [...] clubhouse over there. This isn't the time for us <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about history. If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives rooting for the Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do." [...] Trump advises budding business careerists to have an optimistic outlook. Trump writes, [...] "think positively and expect the best. My positive attitude has brought me a lot of luck." [...] He says those who seek out their passions in life will find financial success. He tells readers to devote two hours a day focusing on how to generate money. The book talks about the importance of concentration on the task at hand, writing, [...] "Focus is a tricky thing. Focus does not mean that you narrow your mind and become inflexible. That is taking focus too far." [...] Trump describes his expectations of loyalty from his employees, writing, [...] "I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. I value loyalty very much. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well. I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times." [...] Trump cites Hillary Clinton as an example of an individual with [...] "the ability to think big", calling her [...] "a fantastic person" [...] and a [...] "very good person". He warns about repercussions for disloyalty, [...] "They must respect or even fear you, or things will go very wrong.

2500|$|The {{character}} was eventually {{to make his}} return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of a}} storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured {{to the top of a}} deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven. For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as [...] "a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it." [...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant." [...] Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said [...] " [...] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about him ...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world." ...|$|E
