5|$|The Corporation {{stipulated that}} several {{manufacturing}} industries should be developed, rather than allowing one sector or firm to dominate. It {{did not seek}} to attract companies by offering financial or other incentives; instead, it set out to create the ideal conditions for industrial development to arise naturally, by providing large plots of land with room for expansion, allowing firms <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> premises or rent ready-made buildings, and constructing {{a wide range of}} building types and sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{reforms of}} Djedkare Isesi played an {{important}} role in flourishing of the arts during the later Old Kingdom, as artisans and craftsmen could now find many wealthy patrons beyond the king. This created a surge in the number of commissions leading to a general improvement of the artistic works. This also provided the artisans with a new wealth, which they used <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> large funerary complexes.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career Braham flew around the World. But, in 1968, Canadian policy pointed to the amalgamation of all the Canadian armed forces into one unified service. Worse still, the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow put an end to Canada's plan <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> fighters which curbed Braham's ambitions as a test pilot. He resigned from the RCAF in January 1968 and settled in Nova Scotia with his wife and three sons. He had flown 5,370 hours in 66 types of aircraft with the RCAF.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} do justice to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E

5|$|With {{the club}} growing in stature, {{they were forced}} to turn down the {{opportunity}} to join the newly formed Second Division of the Southern Football League {{due to the lack of}} facilities at their Sophia Gardens ground. Over the next two years, Cardiff played friendlies against some of Britain's top professional sides, including Middlesbrough, Bristol City and Crystal Palace, with the matches being played at various grounds in Cardiff and nearby towns. The club eventually secured land <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> stadium, moving into Ninian Park in 1910, and made its first signing the following year with the acquisition of Jack Evans from fellow Welsh side Cwmparc.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, {{before the}} {{revolution}} in design brought about by HMS Dreadnought, the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with Dreadnought. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only seen as vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons after WWII, represented a nation's standing in the world. Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; while Ottoman Turkey, Argentina, Russia, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts {{to be built in}} British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|The H-58 {{designation}} {{was created}} after the county-designated highway system itself {{was formed in}} 1970. Initially, only the section from Grand Marais to Deer Park was given the number; the remainder was added in 1972. The last sections to be paved in the 20th century were completed in 1974. The National Park Service was required <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> access road for the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in the initial legislation that created the park. This requirement was rescinded by the United States Congress in 1998, and the park service was authorized to fund improvements to H-58 instead. Paving projects were completed between 2006 and 2010 so that {{the entire length of}} H-58 in Alger County is now paved; the section in Luce County is still a gravel road.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the line was strongly opposed by the S, which put forward a rival proposal {{that led to a}} Parliamentary enquiry. The two companies each had part of their schemes accepted and part rejected. The Ward Jackson group was allowed to build a railway east from Guisborough to Skinningrove with a branch at Slapewath to reach the mine at Skelton. They were not permitted <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> separate line to Middlesbrough and had to rely instead on the M for their connection to the Tees. The S was allowed to build an extension from Redcar to Saltburn but was not allowed to build a new bridge across the Tees. An Act permitting the {{construction of}} the railway was passed in July 1858. The company was capitalised with £120,000, half of which came from the WHH, with Ward Jackson as its first chairman.|$|E
5|$|This traditional, {{historical}} {{portrayal of}} the North-West Mounted Police influenced that of the RCMP, who used their predecessor's history <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> status as a Canadian national symbol. Although the RCMP as an organisation formally dates from 1920, the modern force chose to trace its own history back to {{the foundation of the}} mounted police in 1873, rather than, for example, drawing on the Dominion Police's foundation date of 1868. The RCMP's centennial in 1973 saw celebratory events across Canada, various historical publications and even proposals – turned down by the mounted police – for a reenactment of the March West. The RCMP used the celebrations to redefine the early history of the mounted police in line with contemporary policing objectives, focusing on the force's role in shaping the evolution of a liberal, tolerant, modern Canada.|$|E

5|$|Although no Chinese sources {{detail the}} event, Portuguese sources tell {{of how the}} Portuguese were summoned on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month to ceremoniously {{prostrate}} themselves before a wall of the Forbidden City to seek another audience with the emperor. From Beijing, the Portuguese embassy heard reports that the emperor reached Tongzhou in January 1521 and had the rebel Prince of Ning executed there. The Portuguese embassy had also become aware that ambassadors from the exiled King of Malacca were sent to Beijing seeking assistance from the Chinese emperor in expelling the conquering Portuguese so that their king could be reinstalled there. The Portuguese also knew of two officials in the Censorate—Qiu Daolong and He Ao— who sent memorials to the throne that condemned the Portuguese conquest of Malacca and that their embassy should be rejected. There were also reports sent to Beijing by Canton officials stating that the Portuguese were bothersome foreigners who sought <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> trading post.|$|E
5|$|In 1520, {{the most}} famous church bell in Poland, named Zygmunt after Sigismund I of Poland, was cast by Hans Behem. At that time, Hans Dürer, a younger brother of artist and thinker Albrecht Dürer, was Sigismund's court painter. Hans von Kulmbach made altarpieces for several churches. In 1553, the Kazimierz {{district}} council gave the Jewish Qahal a licence for the right <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> interior walls across the western section of the already existing defensive walls. The walls were expanded again in 1608 due {{to the growth of}} the community and influx of Jews from Bohemia. In 1572, King Sigismund II, the last of the Jagiellons, died childless. The Polish throne passed to Henry III of France and then to other foreign-based rulers in rapid succession, causing a decline in the city's importance that was worsened by pillaging during the Swedish invasion and by an outbreak of bubonic plague that left 20,000 of the city's residents dead. In 1596, Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa moved the administrative capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from Kraków to Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} considered similar memorials. The US {{constructed a}} Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in 1921; while {{the idea was}} clearly a foreign concept, it proved very popular with the American public and by 1936 was attracting over 1.5 m visitors a year and acting as an informal national monument to the war. Edwin Redslob, part of the German government, supported a similar scheme in 1925, but without success, and Mainz Cathedral and Ulm Minster were later proposed as options for a tomb. In Germany, a tomb was not finally built until 1935, when it {{was sponsored by the}} Nazi government; the final memorial contained 20 bodies of unknown German soldiers from the Eastern front. Other countries also constructed tombs, including Belgium and Portugal, and as in France and Britain these tombs were placed in capital cities; there was an abortive attempt to place the Romanian tomb at Mărăşeşti, but this proved impractical for both logistic and ceremonial reasons. Canada, Australia and New Zealand declined <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> tombs, as they were considered to be represented by the burial in London.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{the railway}} connection between Belgrade and Bar {{was made in}} 1952, as a national project of the SFRY.
