5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.|$|E
40|$|Analogue {{experiments}} {{investigate how}} flank collapse affects dike propagation within volcanoes. Water (magma analogue) is injected within a gelatin cone (volcano analogue) with a lateral <b>collapse.</b> <b>The</b> injections form dikes that, away from <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> become radial. <b>The</b> dikes propagating nearby <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> focus towards <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> sides, becoming subparallel to them, {{because of the}} stress reorientation due to the unbuttressing. Only dikes formed along <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> axis (passing through the mean points of <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> map view) propagate radially within <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b> This general model is applied at Stromboli. The Stromboli dikes cluster along and parallel to <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> sides, similar to the experiments. Nevertheless, the current location of the conduit, along <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> axis, leads to dike propagation within <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> infill, rather than at its sides. This may have occurred during the 2002 - 03 eruption, when diking in <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> triggered a landslide and tsunami within <b>the</b> <b>collapse...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> scar {{was partly}} filled by blocks left over by <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b> <b>The</b> {{walls of the}} amphitheatre were about 2000 m high, so high that {{secondary}} landslides occurred.

5|$|Some theory {{requires}} {{selecting a}} fixed {{point on the}} sphere, calling the pair (sphere, point) a pointed sphere. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice {{is a matter of}} convenience. The point (1, 0, 0, …, 0), which is on the equator of all the spheres, works well for geometric spheres; <b>the</b> (<b>collapsed)</b> rim of the disk is another obvious choice.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Security Council {{brokered}} the Renville Agreement in {{an attempt}} to rectify <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> Linggarjati Agreement. The agreement was ratified in January 1948 and recognised a cease-fire along the so-called 'Van Mook line'; an artificial line which connected the most advanced Dutch positions. Many Republican positions, however, were still held behind the Dutch lines. The agreement also required referenda to be held on the political future of the Dutch held areas. The apparent reasonableness of Republicans garnered much important American goodwill.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than {{the age of the}} galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage, then re-expanded.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. <b>The</b> <b>collapsed</b> power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
40|$|Key to the {{dynamics}} of the type of bubble collapse which is associated with such phenomena as sonoluminescence and the emission of strong rebound pressures into the liquid {{is the role of the}} liquid inertia. Following the initial formulation of <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of an empty spherical cavity, such collapses have been termed "Rayleigh-like. " Today this type of cavitation is termed "inertial," reflecting the dominant role of the liquid inertia in the early stages of <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b> While <b>the</b> inertia in models of spherical bubble collapses depends primarily on the liquid, experimental control of the liquid inertia has not readily been achievable without changing the liquid density and, consequently, changing other liquid properties. In this paper, novel experimental apparatus is described whereby the inertia at the early stages of <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of a conical bubble can easily be controlled. <b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> is capable of producing luminescence.

In this paper, we relax their assumptions and elaborate on the space-time geometry of a generic collapsing body with spherical symmetry. The geometry outside <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> sphere is found to be approximated by the geometry outside the white-hole horizon, hence <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> matter remains outside the Schwarzschild radius.

A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of {{what was left of the}} concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{influential}} was {{the work}} of William Wallace, the king's master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631.

He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan like that used at Château d'Ancy-le-Franc. This style can be seen in lord's houses built at Caerlaverlock (1620), Moray House, Edinburgh (1628) and Drumlanrig Castle (1675–89), and was highly influential until the baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century, which were used to produce classically inspired and comfortable country houses.|$|E

5|$|As Généreux {{pulled away}} to the west, Thompson, who had already been wounded several times, succeeded in turning his {{battered}} ship so that his broadside was directed at the stern of Généreux. Despite <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> wreckage of the mizzenmast and fore topmast, his gunnery teams managed to cut away enough of the obstruction to fire a raking broadside at the French vessel. Although Leander had inflicted severe damage, the size {{and power of the}} French ship was beginning to tell, and Lejoille was able to turn Généreux southwards again. The ships continued exchanging broadsides until 15:30, by which time Leanders crew had run out of regular shot and were firing scrap metal at the French ship. Eventually Lejoille succeeded in bringing Généreux across Leanders bow and hailed the British ship, asking if they had surrendered. Unable to continue fighting due to the wreckage that lay across the forward guns, Thompson ordered a French flag raised on a pike, which was sufficient for Lejoille to cease firing.|$|E
5|$|At Cortex's base, Uka Uka derides Cortex {{for failing}} to destroy Crash and replaces Cortex with his niece, Nina Cortex, despite protests from Neo, N. Gin and Tiny Tiger. Nina has Coco brainwashed and makes her {{participate}} {{in the construction of}} the Doominator. Throughout the course of the game, Crash and Aku Aku interrogate Tiny Tiger, Doctor N. Gin and Uka Uka on the whereabouts of Coco. When they confront Nina Cortex inside the Doominator robot, Nina summons her Arachnina cyborg and fights Crash. Crash eventually destroys the robot, liberating Coco and disabling the Doominator. The Doominator collapses and barely misses the Bandicoot home (and Crunch), sparing much of Wumpa Island. Escaping from <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> Doominator, Cortex praises Nina for betraying him, and promises to be more evil in the near future. The Bandicoots decide that it is time for celebration, leading Crash to shout his first word in the series and the object of their celebration: pancakes.|$|E
5|$|Caprica-Six and Boomer {{are next}} shown conversing with Number Three. While the three move up a stairwell, {{explosives}} {{set by the}} resistance led by Samuel T. Anders (Michael Trucco) detonate, trapping Anders, Three, Boomer, and Caprica-Six in a parking garage. While Anders is originally shielded and hidden by the blast, Caprica-Six breaks her leg. Number Three offers to euthanize her, but Caprica-Six refuses as she suspects that Number Three will {{take the opportunity to}} box her. Shortly afterwards, the three find Anders who Number Three intends to kill before being stopped by Boomer and Caprica-Six. As Number Three goads them, Boomer and Caprica-Six understand that their unique view of humanity through their love for Baltar and Galen Tyrol gives them a perspective that makes them a threat to the Cylon status-quo. When Number Three attempts to kill Anders, she is killed by Caprica-Six who, along with Boomer, allow Anders to escape. Recognizing that it will take some time for Number Three to resurrect and report them, Caprica-Six and Boomer form a pact to change the Cylon perspective of humanity together before finally being rescued from <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> parking garage by the other Cylons.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple truss {{bridge over the}} South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E

Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50tons of disinfectant {{to prevent the spread of}} disease, while the provincial government allocated ¥240million (CNY, US$35million) for rebuilding. About 1,000soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming. <b>The</b> <b>collapsed</b> dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient. Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident, which ultimately totaled ¥245million (CNY, US$38.7million).

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some western lands to the Livonian Order– portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava. There is some discussion {{as to whether}} in later years (1255, 1257, 1259, 1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the Order. The deeds might have been falsified by the Order; the case for this scenario is bolstered {{by the fact that}} some of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas. Whatever the case, relative peace and stability was established for about eight more years. Mindaugas used this opportunity to concentrate on expansion to the east. He strengthened his influence in Black Ruthenia, in Pinsk, and took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> Kievan Rus' by conquering Polatsk, a major center of commerce in the Daugava River basin. He also negotiated a peace with Galicia–Volhynia, and married a daughter to Svarn, the son of Daniel of Galicia, who would later become Grand Duke of Lithuania. Diplomatic relations with western Europe and the Holy See were also reinforced. In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from Pope Alexander IV to crown his son as King of Lithuania. In the domestic arena, Mindaugas strove to establish state institutions: his own noble court, administrative systems, a diplomatic service, and a monetary system. Silver Lithuanian long currency (Lithuanian: Lietuvos ilgieji) circulated, providing an indice of statehood.|$|E
