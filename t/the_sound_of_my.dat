500|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} Zoe Williams criticised {{the actual}} waterboarding in the torture scene, saying [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred. 'I only lasted five to 10 seconds, and <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice crying out to stop isn't me acting.' Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off {{but this is}} all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, {{to see what it}} would be like on the train to Auschwitz. If you can make it stop whenever you like, you're learning nothing and kicking people in the face while you're at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series, Last Broadcast held a poll for the top five most {{shocking}} death scenes in Spooks. Two of them were deaths from the seventh series. Adam Carter's death was voted the fourth most shocking, while Ben Kaplan's death was voted third. Connie's death however, was not listed. The featuring of an actual waterboarding scene drew criticism from Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, who wrote [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred.

500|$|In a {{flashback}} sequence {{in one of}} his early episodes, Lucas is subjected to waterboarding, a method of psychological torture. In order to ensure the authenticity of the sequence, Armitage was himself subjected to the actual torture while shooting. He agreed to perform the sequence after he was convinced by consultants for the FSB and CIA. Armitage was only subjected to it for a short time, and was filmed in slow motion to make it appear he was on for longer. The ambient temperature of the room was also raised to make him as comfortable as possible. However, after the sequence was shot, Armitage changed his opinion entirely, stating; [...] "I only lasted five to ten seconds, and <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice crying out to stop isn't me acting." [...] Armitage shot more interrogation scenes during production of the eighth series, but only some were added into the episodes. He was [...] "less physical" [...] in the ninth series.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{allow the}} cast to perform {{many of their}} own stunts. In filming fight sequences, they were carefully choreographed beforehand so the actors could participate themselves. The guns featured on the series are real. In scenes where guns are included, an armourer is on hand throughout {{the entirety of the}} sequence to see if the actors are handling them properly and gives out the guns to the actors at the last possible second before filming. After the sequence is shot, the guns have to be returned and locked in a case to prevent anybody from playing with them, even if the guns are not loaded. Among other stunt work, Armitage was asked to be subjected to an actual waterboarding scene to ensure the authenticity of the sequence.

2500|$|Jones pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records {{came as a}} {{surprise}} to many; Sherrill and business partner Glenn Sutton are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from George's honky tonk roots. [...] Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although Billboard chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and Charlie Rich, with Jones Sherrill had his most longest-lasting association. [...] In Sherrill, Jones found what Andrew Meuller of Uncut described as [...] "the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded...He summoned for Jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974's The Grand Tour and 1976's Alone Again sound better than happiness could possibly feel." [...] In 1974, they scored a number one hit with the instant classic [...] "The Grand Tour" [...] and followed that with [...] "The Door" [...] (I've heard <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dear old mother cryin'/and the sound of the train that took me off to war), another number one smash. [...] Unlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones' voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. [...] While Jones wrote fewer songs himself - songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years - he still managed to co-write several, such as [...] "What My Woman Can't Do" [...] (also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), [...] "A Drunk Can't Be A Man", the harrowing [...] "I Just Don't Give a Damn" [...] (perhaps the greatest [...] "lost classic" [...] in the entire Jones catalogue) and [...] "These Days (I Barely Get By)", which he had written with Wynette.|$|E

60|$|The {{young girl}} {{looked up at}} <b>the</b> first <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice, and {{verified}} me as the elderly man whom she had seen before; and then {{she looked down at}} the water again. I understood, and I freely forgave her. If my beard had been brown instead of grey I should have been an adventure; but to the eye of girlhood adventure can never wear a grey beard. I was truly sorry for her; I could read in the pensive droop of her averted face that I was again a disappointment.|$|R
60|$|How shall I {{describe}} the delicious feeling of profound rest that ensued when I found myself prone and motionless?

60|$|As I approached, <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> voices smote <b>my</b> ear, for {{the lighted}} window stood open.

6000|$|I {{spoke to}} her; but desisted almost immediately--desisted even from uttering her name. At <b>the</b> mere <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> voice, her {{suffering}} rose to agony; the wild despair {{of the soul}} wrestling awfully with the writhing weakness of the body, uttered itself in words and cries horrible, beyond all imagination, to hear. I sank {{down on my knees}} by the bedside; the strength which had sustained me for hours, gave way in an instant, and I burst into a passion <b>of</b> tears, as <b>my</b> spirit poured from my lips in supplication for hers--tears that did not humiliate me; for I knew, while I shed them, that I had forgiven her! ...|$|R
