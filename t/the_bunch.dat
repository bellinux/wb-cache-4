The effect is best seen in the shots where <b>the</b> <b>Bunch</b> makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes {{between them and the}} camera; {{most of the people in}} the foreground are as sharply focused as <b>the</b> <b>Bunch.</b> The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.|$|E

40|$|Positron beam {{position}} {{measurement for}} the Advanced Photon Source (APS) linac beam {{is affected by}} the presence of electrons that are also captured and accelerated along with the positrons. This paper presents a method of measuring positron position in a beam consisting of alternating bunches of positrons and electrons. The method is based on Fourier analysis of a stripline signal at <b>the</b> <b>bunching</b> and first harmonic frequencies. In the presence of a mixed species beam, a certain linear combination of bunching and first harmonic signals depends only on the position and charge of one specie of particle. A formula is derived for the stripline signal at all harmonics of <b>the</b> <b>bunching</b> frequency and is used to compute expected signal power at <b>the</b> <b>bunching</b> and first harmonic frequencies for typical electron and positron <b>bunch</b> charges. <b>The</b> stripline is calibrated by measuring the signal power content at <b>the</b> <b>bunching</b> and first harmonic frequencies for a single species beam.
