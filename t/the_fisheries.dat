5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets.

5|$|The tribes {{involved}} benefited {{greatly from}} the decision.

The tribes became co-managers of <b>the</b> <b>fisheries</b> along with the state, hiring fish biologists and staff to carry out those duties. The Makah tribe, based on the terms of the Neah Bay Treaty and the Boldt decision, took their first California gray whale in over seventy years in 1999.

5|$|To the north, the {{conflict}} held a strong economic component {{in addition to}} territorial disputes. Newfoundland {{was the site of}} a British colony based at St. John's, and the French colonial base was at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors) who competed with one another for <b>the</b> <b>fisheries</b> of the Grand Banks, which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, trade between Minehead and Ireland, South Wales, Bristol and Bridgwater grew, with forty vessels based in the harbour for trade and herring fishing. It was also a departure point for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostella. Until the 19th century trade continued with Ireland but Minehead vessels started to travel further afield to Virginia and the West Indies. Further problems with the port continued and led to a decline in trade and <b>the</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the late 18th century and in 1834 the port lost its jurisdiction to Bridgwater. In the 20th century most trade transferred to larger ports, but pleasure steamers did call at the port. Minehead Lifeboat Station was established in 1901 near the harbour. The pier was demolished during the Second World War as it obstructed the view from the gun battery on the quay head, as part of the coastal defence preparations, which stopped steamers calling at the harbour until it was cleared in 1951. In 1808 a ship, believed to be the Bristol Packet which had been built in 1801 was wrecked on Madbrain Sands.|$|E

5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier <b>the</b> <b>Fisheries</b> {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level.

Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E
5|$|Real {{advantages}} of the peace came in the economic field. As an open economy, the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was heavily dependent on exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding fata morgana. True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the U.S.A. and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, {{and the decline of}} <b>the</b> <b>fisheries.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 2010 to 2011, {{the state}} {{experienced}} a slower growth due to weaker {{performance on the}} oil and gas sector.

Its GDP per capita however are still lowest with RM19,672, the third lowest after Kelantan (RM11,815) and Kedah (RM17,321) from all 13 states. In the same year, the state export value stood at RM45.3billion with an import value of RM36.5billion. Machinery and transportation equipment accounted for most of the imported products followed by fuel, mineral lubricants and others. While Sabah mostly exports raw petroleum and palm oil. The state currently has a total of eight ports with two in Sepanggar while each one in Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Kudat, Kunak and Lahad Datu that was operated and maintained by the Sabah Ports Authority owned by Suria Group. As part of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP), the federal government has approved an allocation of RM800million to expand the cargo handling of Sapangar Bay Container Port from 500,000 to 1.25million TEUs per annum as well to accommodate larger ship like Panamax-size vessels.

5|$|While {{work on the}} Synopsis of Quadrupeds {{was still}} in progress, Pennant decided on a journey to Scotland, a {{relatively}} unexplored country and not previously visited by a naturalist. He set out in June 1769 and kept a journal and made sketches as he travelled. He visited the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast on the way and was much impressed by the breeding seabird colonies. He entered Scotland via Berwick-on-Tweed and proceeded via Edinburgh and up the east coast, continuing through Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness. His return journey south took him through Fort William, Glen Awe, Inverary and Glasgow. He was unimpressed by the climate but was interested in all he saw and made enquiries about the local economy. He described in detail the scenery around Loch Ness. He enthused over the Arctic char, a fish new to him but did not mention a monster in the lake. He observed red deer, black grouse, white hares and ptarmigan. He saw the capercaillie in the forests of Glenmoriston and Strathglass and mentioned the pine grosbeak, the only occasion on which it has been recorded from Scotland. He enquired into <b>the</b> <b>fisheries</b> and commerce of the different places he passed through and visited the great houses, reporting on the antiquities he found there. He finished his journey by visiting Edinburgh again and travelling through Moffat, Gretna and Carlisle {{on his way back}} to Wales, having taken about three months on his travels. On his return home, Pennant wrote an account of his tour in Scotland which met with some acclaim and which may have been responsible for an increase in the number of English people visiting the country.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{conducted}} a socioeconomic {{assessment of the}} commercial weathervane scallop (Patinopecten caurinus) <b>fishery</b> off Alaska. <b>The</b> research was structured {{within the framework of}} an SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis, a strategy commonly used to analyze the internal (strengths, weaknesses) and external (opportunities, threats) components of an industry. Specifically, we focused on five categories: social, technological, economic, environmental, and regulatory. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 participants who had detailed knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>fishery,</b> including industry members, fishery managers, biologists, and members of coastal communities who interact with <b>the</b> <b>fishery.</b> We addressed topics such as attitudes of the Alaskan public towards scallop dredging, impacts of the scallop industry on Alaskan coastal communities, market influences of U. S. east coast and imported scallops, changes in the management of <b>the</b> <b>fishery,</b> and a number of environmental considerations. Several unifying opinions emerged from this study, including a lack of awareness of <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> in many Alaskan communities and fears about rising fuel costs and diminishing harvest levels. Whereas the data-poor status of the stock appears to be <b>the</b> <b>fishery's</b> biggest weakness, <b>the</b> greatest strengths {{come in the form of}} conservative management, industry self-regulation, and the small footprint of <b>the</b> <b>fishery.</b> Impending threats include stock decline, unknown long-term detrimental effects of dredging, and changes in the management and structure of <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> with <b>the</b> sunset of the State of Alaska's limited entry permit program.
