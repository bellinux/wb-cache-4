5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> tries to feed him again, Gary finds that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E

25|$|The first London {{production}} debuted at the Saville Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue on 30 April 1959 (after {{playing for}} a short time at the New Theatre Oxford and the Manchester Opera House).

The cast included Denis Quilley as Candide, Mary Costa as Cunegonde, Laurence Naismith as Dr. Pangloss and Edith Coates as <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Lady.</b> The Musical Director was Alexander Faris.

25|$|The club strip {{was changed}} again in 1901, Genoa adopted its famous red-navy halves and {{therefore}} {{became known as}} the rossoblu; these are the colours used even to this day as many other Italian club do as Cagliari, Bologna and an endless list of minor clubs. After a season of finishing runners-up to Milan Cricket and Football Club, things were back on track in 1902 with their fourth title. Juventus emerged as serious contenders to Genoa's throne from 1903 onwards, when for two seasons in a row Genoa beat <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Lady</b> in the national final.|$|E
25|$|After a while, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> {{returned}} to the cave and noticed Yūkei's departure, whereupon her appearance transformed into that of a fearsome onibaba and then started to give chase at a furious speed. The onibaba caught up and was right behind Yūkei. In this time of desperation, Yūkei took out his statue of Nyoirin Kan'non Bosatsu (a form of Guanyin) from his pack and started to desperately chant a sutra. As he did so, the Bosatsu statue started to dance up into the sky, forming a shining demon-slaying pure white bow and a vajra (indestructible substance) arrow that shot and slew the onibaba.|$|E

25|$|Juventus is {{considered}} a great rival of Parma largely due to their recent duels, which include Parma's 1995 UEFA Cup victory, its first and third Coppa Italia triumphs, Supercoppa Italiana defeats in 1995 and 2002, and its 1995 domestic cup final defeat to <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Lady.</b> These six matches comprise {{nearly half of the}} fourteen major finals Parma has participated in. Ironically, Parma's colours have their origins in those Juventus wears, and the switch from white and black to a yellow and blue home kit in the late 1990s took place in order to distance and distinguish Parma from Juventus. Parma maintain keenly fought rivalries with Vicenza and Genoa.|$|E
25|$|Budhigarh or {{literally}} the fort of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>lady</b> {{is one of}} the ancient urban centers in Kalahandi and configures on the right bank of the river Rahul in Kalahandi. The location of Budigarh is moreover on the ancient salt route range of Mohangiri that connected Kalinga, South-Kosala and Kantara. It was the strategic location of Budhigarh which seems to have contributed for the rise of township in ancient period. Fortification of Budhigarh is discerned towards its west where a huge brick wall runs in south–north direction. The total settlement area of Budhigarh spreads over 12.75 hectares of land. The urban center of Budhigarh is 20km from the metropolitan center of Kharligarh.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Guild {{released}} {{the first official}} Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300guitars. In 1993 Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer—the luthier who restored <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Lady</b> in 1998—as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).|$|E
