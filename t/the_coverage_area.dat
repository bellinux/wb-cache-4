3000|$|Note {{that the}} power {{variables}} affect both <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> (see (5)) and the data rates. However, {{it is extremely difficult}} to deal with both effects jointly. For this reason, we assume a worst-case approach when defining <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> assuming that <b>the</b> interference is maximum 3. <b>The</b> worst-case <b>coverage</b> sets are, therefore, defined as S_j(τ) = {i∈B [...] | [...] P^i_CPICH/P̅^i_BS(C_i(τ)) + A̅_ji(τ)>γ _CPICH}, where A̅_ji(τ) = σ _j^ 2 + ∑ _m∈B, m≠ ih_jm(τ)(P̅^m_BS (C_m(τ)) + P^m_CPICH)/h_ji(τ). With this, <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> only depend on the current battery and channel state.|$|R

50|$|However, <b>the</b> signal <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> {{of a given}} {{cell site}} may change {{according}} {{to the time of}} day, weather, and physical obstructions in relation to where a cellular device attempts to access service. The maps of cell site <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> used by law enforcement may also lack precision as a general matter. For these reasons, it is beneficial to use a StingRay and a test phone to map out <b>the</b> precise <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> of all cell sites appearing in the HCSLI records. This is typically done at the same time of day and under the same weather conditions that were in effect when the HCSLI was logged. Using a StingRay to conduct base station surveys in this manner allows for mapping out cell site <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> that more accurately match <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>areas</b> that were in effect when the cellular device was used.|$|R

25|$|In OFDM based {{wide area}} broadcasting, {{receivers}} {{can benefit from}} receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously, since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other on {{a limited number of}} sub-carriers, whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area. This is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national single-frequency networks (SFN), where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency. SFNs utilise the available spectrum more effectively than conventional multi-frequency broadcast networks (MFN), where program content is replicated on different carrier frequencies. SFNs also result in a diversity gain in receivers situated midway between the transmitters. <b>The</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an MFN, due to increased received signal strength averaged over all sub-carriers.|$|E
25|$|The CBC's {{long-range}} radio plan (LRRP) {{was developed}} by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in collaboration with the CBC to identify those FM frequencies that would likely be required to deliver the CBC's radio services to the maximum number of Canadians. The CBC is not subject to any conditions or expectations concerning its LRRP. The CBC noted that Première Chaîne (now Ici Radio-Canada Première) and CBC Radio One were available to about 99 percent of the Canadian population. The CBC stated that it plans to maintain its radio service but has no plans to grow <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>area.</b> It described the LRRP as a planning vehicle and indicated that it would no longer use it. Given reductions in public funding to the CBC and given that Première Chaîne and Radio One are available to the vast majority of Canadians, the commission considers that the CBC's plan to maintain current coverage and discontinue the LRRP is reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission accepts the CBC's proposal to discontinue the LRRP.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, WBNI {{replaced}} the directional antenna on the tower in Roanoke with an omnidirectional antenna, {{resulting in a}} better signal in <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>area.</b> [...] There was no change in effective radiated power, which remains at 6,000 watts.|$|E
30|$|We {{adopt the}} {{non-uniform}} mobility model {{within a single}} cell as in [7] where users in double coverage and cellular only areas have different mobility behaviors since WLAN hotspots are usually deployed in indoor environments and thus the users in <b>the</b> double <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> have low mobility. Specifically, the residence time in <b>the</b> double <b>coverage</b> <b>area,</b> Tdca, is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with mean 1 /ηdca. On the other hand, the residence time in the cellular only area, Tcoa, has an exponential distribution with mean 1 /ηcoa. As illustrated in Figure 2, the MSs moving out <b>the</b> WLAN <b>coverage</b> enter <b>the</b> cellular-only <b>area.</b> The MSs {{moving out of the}} cellular-only area can enter <b>the</b> double <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> with probability pcoa→dca, whereas they move to neighbor cells with the probability pcoa→coa [7].

40|$|Multicell {{cooperation}} {{has been}} identified as one of the underlying principles for future wireless communication systems. This paper studies the benefits of multicell cooperation in broadcast TV network from an information theoretical perspective. We define outage capacity as the figure of merit and derive <b>the</b> broadcast <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> to evaluate such system. Specifically, we calculate <b>the</b> broadcast <b>coverage</b> <b>area</b> with given common information rate and outage probabilities when multiple base stations collaboratively transmit the broadcast signals. For the general MIMO case where receivers have multiple antennas, we provide simulation results to illustrate <b>the</b> expanded <b>coverage</b> <b>area.</b> In all cases, our results show that <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of a TV broadcast network can be significantly improved by multicell cooperation...|$|R

2500|$|The {{reception}} quality {{during the early}} stage of deployment of DAB was poor even for people who live well within <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>area.</b> The {{reason for this is}} that the old version of DAB uses weak error correction coding, so that when there are a lot of errors with the received data not enough of the errors can be corrected and a [...] "bubbling mud" [...] sound occurs. In some cases a complete loss of signal can happen. This situation has been improved upon in the new DAB standard (DAB+, discussed below) that uses stronger error correction coding and as additional transmitters are built.|$|E

2500|$|The {{discipline}} of stochastic geometry [...] entails the mathematical study of [...] random objects defined on some (often Euclidean) space.

In wireless networks (for example, cellular networks) the underlying geometry (the relative locations of nodes) plays a fundamental role due to the interference of other transmitters, whereas in wired networks (for example, the Internet) the underlying geometry is less important.|$|E
