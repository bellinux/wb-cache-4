5|$|On 31 March 1731, The Author's Farce was {{paired with}} the Tom Thumb remake, The Tragedy of Tragedies, as a {{replacement}} for The Letter Writers, the original companion piece. Although both Tragedy of Tragedies and The Author's Farce were main shows, they alternated on the billing until the 18 June 1731 performance, the final showing of any Fielding play in the Little Theatre except for a 12 May 1732 benefit show of The Author's Farce. The last documented non-puppet version was performed on 28 March 1748 by Theophilus Cibber as a two-act companion piece for a benefit show. <b>The</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town act was performed as a one-act play outside London throughout the century, including a 15-show run at Norwich in 1749 and during the 1750s, and a production at York during the 1751–52 theatre season. Additionally, there were benefit shows that included the third act at a variety of locations, including Dublin, on 19 December 1763 and Edinburgh in 1763. There were also many performances of the puppet theatre versions, including a travelling show by Thomas Yeates, titled Punch's Oratory, or <b>The</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, which started in 1734.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and <b>the</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating {{that it was in}} rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and <b>the</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town is a {{play by the}} English {{playwright and}} novelist Henry Fielding, first {{performed}} on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket. Written {{in response to the}} Theatre Royal's rejection of his earlier plays, The Author's Farce was Fielding's first theatrical success. The Little Theatre allowed Fielding the freedom to experiment, and to alter the traditional comedy genre. The play ran during the early 1730s and was altered for its run starting 21 April 1730 and again in response to the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Throughout its life, the play was coupled with several different plays, including The Cheats of Scapin and Fielding's Tom Thumb.|$|E

5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled <b>The</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|Most of Fielding's plays {{were written}} in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening {{introduces}} the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins {{in much the same}} way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, <b>The</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.|$|E

25|$|Denis de Rougemont {{said that}} the troubadours were {{influenced}} by Cathar doctrines which rejected <b>the</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flesh {{and that they were}} metaphorically addressing the spirit and soul of their ladies. Rougemont also said that courtly love subscribed to the code of chivalry, and therefore a knight's loyalty was always to his King before his mistress. Edmund Reiss claimed it was also a spiritual love, but a love that had more in common with Christian love, or caritas. On the other hand, scholars such as Mosché Lazar claim it was adulterous sexual love with physical possession of the lady the desired end.|$|E
500|$|Fielding's fifth play, The Author's Farce and <b>the</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town, {{first opened}} on 30 March 1730 at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and {{initially}} ran for 41 nights, which marked it {{as a major}} success. The play incorporates Fielding's response to Drury Lane and their previous rejection of his works. It also contains a third act, a puppet show, that pokes fun at theatre and the literary community as a whole. The play was revived many times in its original format {{and later in the}} medium of puppet show for its entire format. The plot focuses on Harry Luckless, an author, as he attempts to have a successful writing career, pursue women, dodge his landlady, and eventually put on a show within the show. To emphasise the literary satire, Fielding introduced his persona [...] "Scriblerus Secundus" [...] and adopts the tradition of the Scriblerus Club.|$|E

500|$|Various travel {{writers in}} the 1950s extolled <b>the</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nightly cruises and meals on the Old Bay Line's antique steamers. By the mid-1950s, however, {{improved}} highways {{and the increase in}} air travel meant that the Old Bay Line's 12-hour transit time between Baltimore and Norfolk was a comparatively slow means of transportation. Old Bay Line officials hoped that the steamship line's unique service might continue to appeal to travellers seeking the pleasures of a cruise on the scenic Chesapeake with fine dining en route and a well-furnished, private stateroom. The Sunday travel section of The New York Times in 1954 featured the [...] "long established, more leisurely water route across Chesapeake Bay", as the writer described the Old Bay Line, recommending [...] "the boat trip can be made comfortably and comparatively inexpensively every night between Baltimore, Old Point Comfort and Norfolk, and on alternate nights between Washington, D. C., and the Virginia communities".|$|E
500|$|As a {{teenager}} David enjoyed painting, {{and her mother}} thought her talent worth developing. She was sent to Paris in 1930, studying painting privately and enrolling at the Sorbonne for a course in French civilisation which covered history, literature and architecture. She found her Sorbonne studies arduous {{and in many ways}} uninspiring, but they left her with a love of French literature and a fluency in the language that remained with her throughout her life. She lodged with a Parisian family, whose fanatical devotion to <b>the</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table she portrayed to comic effect in her French Provincial Cooking (1960). Nevertheless, she acknowledged in retrospect that the experience had been the most valuable part of her time in Paris: [...] "I realized in what way the family had fulfilled their task of instilling French culture into at least one of their British charges. Forgotten were the Sorbonne professors.... What had stuck was the taste for a kind of food quite ideally unlike anything I had known before." [...] Stella Gwynne was not eager for her daughter's early return to England after qualifying for her Sorbonne diploma, and sent her from Paris to Munich in 1931 to study German.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single [...] "Aruku Around" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. CDJournal reviewers gave the single its star of recommendation, {{calling it a}} [...] "killer tune" [...] where the [...] "pleasure {{of living in the}} moment" [...] and [...] "prudence" [...] is balanced. They noted the song's retro sound, like nostalgic dance music, and felt that the band's decision to move to Tokyo two years ago was reflected in the song. Kenji Sasaki of Skream! felt that the song had a [...] "gentle electronica feel", praising the 1980s-style synths, aggressive sound and [...] "unique poetic sentiment" [...] of Yamaguchi's. He also praised the emotions the song gave him, mixing pain and exhilaration. Tomoki Takahashi of Rockin' On Japan felt the greatest strength of the song was how its lyrical content jarred with its [...] "high-spirited words" [...] and [...] "explosive hybrid beat". He noted that instead of talking about <b>the</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dance floor, Yamaguchi's lyrics were introspective, discussing loneliness, pain and longing. Takahashi praised the brave fanfare-like synth based leading melody, and the [...] "tight" [...] and [...] "earth-shaking" [...] four on the floor beat.|$|E

They were made available through music websites, blogs, and his own website. The song [...] "June" [...] was released through The Huffington Post on June 15. Excluded from the album, it is a somber, jazz-styled track that contrasts the album's raw aesthetic, with upright bass and blue chord changes. Hunt explained the song to be [...] "about a somber girl. I'm identifying with her somberness, but trying to make her smile ... he June bloom has set in her and she's struggling with it." [...] On July 7, Hunt released another non-album track, [...] "The Savage, Sincere L of P", on Pastes website.

Hunt also promoted the album with a 20-date national headlining tour, his first national tour since 2008.

He performed with members of his session band, drummer Ruth Price and keyboardist Peter Dyer, as well as guitarist Douglas Showalter.

500|$|The Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{independently}} {{head of the}} Court of Chancery, {{was also}} involved in the Exchequer of Pleas as {{a check on the}} Lord High Treasurer. He evolved out of the Lord Chancellor's clerk, or clericus cancellari, who sat in the Exchequer and was responsible for correcting and sealing writs of summons, also holding the Exchequer's copy of the Great Seal. The earliest appearances of such a clerk in the records come from 1220, when a document was signed by Robert de Neville, cancellarius. The Lord Chancellors of the time were clergymen with little interest in judicial or fiscal matters; as a result, the clerk became more independent from the Chancellor and, by the 1230s, became a royal appointment holding the seal independently of the Lord Chancellor, known as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. After 1567 the Chancellor was additionally confirmed as the Under-Treasurer of the Exchequer, allowing him to carry out the Treasurer's duties when he was unavailable. The Chancellor was appointed by letters patent, and until 1672 it was a life appointment, then changed to an office [...] "to hold only during <b>the</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown". Until the English Civil War the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a judicial office with little political standing; after the War, however, it became seen as a [...] "stepping stone" [...] to higher political appointments. After 1672 it again became an administrative and judicial office, until 1714, when the Chancellor's position as head of the Treasury made it an important appointment again.|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} {{husband of}} a British queen regnant, William of Orange, had become king, refusing {{to take a}} subordinate rank to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne {{as a means of}} building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife's authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew [...] "nothing except what the prince tells me", but it was an artifice. Husbands had a legal right to their wife's property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church's teachings for a man to be subject to his wife. George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. [...] "I am her Majesty's subject", he said, [...] "I shall do naught but what she commands me." [...] In the words of historian Anne Somerset, [...] "the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism." [...] Winston Churchill wrote that he [...] "was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured... He was neither clever nor learned—a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all <b>the</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. Charles's well-known verdict... does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character." ...|$|E
