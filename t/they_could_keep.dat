5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to the Intel 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. The long-range Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
5|$|He them imprisons the Gandhara {{royal family}} in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per {{prisoner}} and that too the left over food of the kaurava clan.The prisoners start {{fighting for the}} few rice grains thrown at them. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> {{at least one of}} their princes alive. He chooses Shakuni to be alive. Shakuni takes an oath that he will do everything he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan.The whole royal family except Shakuni dies in the prison. Shakuni makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Shakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Shakuni joins the evil of coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.|$|E
5|$|The first Grey Cup {{game was}} held on December 4, 1909, between two Toronto clubs: the University of Toronto Varsity Blues {{defeated}} the Parkdale Canoe Club 26–6 before 3,800 fans. The trophy was not ready for presentation following the game, and the Varsity Blues did not receive it until March 1910. They retained the trophy in the following two years, defeating the Hamilton Tigers in 1910 and the Toronto Argonauts in 1911. The University of Toronto failed to reach the 1912 Grey Cup, which was won by the Hamilton Alerts over the Argonauts. The Varsity Blues refused {{to hand over the}} trophy on the belief <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> it until they were defeated in a title game. They kept the trophy until 1914 when they were defeated by the Argonauts, who made the trophy available to subsequent champions.|$|E

25|$|Because {{a budget}} deficit of the {{government}} drastically increased, and reached 2.3 million ding of paper currency in 1330 alone, Tugh Temür's court attempted to curtail its spending on such items as imperial grants, Buddhist sacrifices, and palace expenses.

25|$|Many foreign investors, {{especially}} British, {{financed the}} great ranches of the era. Overstocking {{of the range}} and the terrible winter of 1886 resulted in a disaster, with many cattle starved and frozen to death. Theodore Roosevelt, a rancher in the Dakotas, lost his entire investment; he returned east to reenter politics. From then on, ranchers generally raised feed to ensure <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> their cattle alive over winter.|$|E

25|$|The initial French {{reaction}} to the island's fall was to tell the British <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> it if they wanted, but could expect no compensation if they handed it back. It was soon realised {{that this was not}} a plausible stance, as the island could be used as a base for privateers and the Royal Navy. Ultimately after two years of occupation the island was handed back to France in the wake of the Treaty of Paris (1763), exchanged directly for the return of Menorca to Britain.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 2017, Theresa May {{stated in}} the House of Commons that anyone {{affected}} by the tragedy, regardless of their immigration status, would be entitled to support, including healthcare services and accommodation. No immigration checks would be performed on those affected. (Two weeks later, however, the government said that anyone coming forward {{would be subject to}} normal immigration rules, including the possibility of deportation, after twelve months.) May added that it was important for those receiving payments from the fund to understand that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the money – they would not have to pay it back, and it would not impact their entitlement to any other benefits.|$|E
25|$|Self-discipline, not kadavergehorsam (mindless obedience) was {{the goal}} of Spartan education. Sparta placed the values of liberty, equality, and {{fraternity}} {{at the center of}} their ethical system. These values applied to every full Spartan citizen, immigrant, merchant, and even to the helots, but not to the dishonored. Helots are unique in the history of slavery in that unlike traditional slaves, they were allowed to keep and gain wealth. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> half their agricultural produce and presumably sell it; thus accumulating wealth. There are known to have been some occasions that a helot with enough money was allowed to purchase their freedom from the state.|$|E

25|$|During his career, Christman {{advocated}} {{for the advancement}} of nursing education. In the late 1960s, Christman predicted increased specialization in the next generation of nurses; he {{advocated for}} nurses to be freed of non-clinical tasks so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> up with the nursing demands in an increasingly technological environment. In a 1978 presentation in Australia, he argued against systems which utilized a combination of registered nurses, nurse aides and student nurses; he highlighted statistics which showed that nurse aides were unoccupied up to 25 percent of the typical work day. Christman served multiple terms as president of the Michigan Nurses Association and he proposed the idea that led to the founding of the American Academy of Nursing.|$|E
25|$|Ed Roberts optimistically {{told his}} banker {{that he could}} sell 800 computers, while in reality they needed to sell 200 {{over the next year}} just to break even. When readers got the January issue of Popular Electronics, MITS was flooded with {{inquiries}} and orders. They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones. In February MITS received 1,000 orders for the Altair 8800. The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was months before they could meet that. Roberts focused on delivering the computer; all of the options would wait until <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> pace with the orders. MITS claimed to have delivered 2,500 Altair 8800s by the end of May. The number was over 5,000 by August 1975. MITS had under 20 employees in January but had grown to 90 by October 1975.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the KC-97 and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers was pushed by the Cold War requirement of the United States {{to be able to}} keep fleets of nuclear-armed B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers airborne around-the-clock either to threaten retaliation against a Soviet strike for mutual assured destruction, or to bomb the U.S.S.R. first had it been ordered to do so by the President of the United States. The bombers would fly orbits around their assigned positions from which they were to enter Soviet airspace if they received the order, and the tankers would refill the bombers' fuel tanks so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> a force in the air 24 hours a day, and still have enough fuel to reach their targets in the Soviet Union. This also ensured that a first strike against the bombers' airfields could not obliterate the U.S.'s ability to retaliate by bomber.|$|E
60|$|Cowards and slaves! The {{thing they}} feared above all, you see, was death.

25|$|After {{having been}} deposed by Leontius, Justinian escaped to the Khagan of the Khazars who welcomed him and even gave his sister {{as a wife}} to him. Renaming his wife Theodora he settled at Phanagoria at the {{entrance}} to the Sea of Azov where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on Imperial events. Justinian was forced to act when in 704 word reached that he was wanted dead or alive for a handsome reward. Such rumors were confirmed when a band of soldiers arrived at his location. Realizing that his life was in danger, he invited two of the officers (whom he suspected as the assassins) to his house and murdered them. Leaving his wife in the safety of her brother, he fled to Bulgaria, Byzantium's chief opponent in the West. There he secured a pact with the Bulgar King Tervel granting him the title of Caesar if he aided him in regaining the throne of Byzantium.|$|E
25|$|After {{these details}} emerged, at least 27 {{different}} lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws against Pilatus, Morvan and Arista Records. One such filing occurred on 22 November 1990, in Ohio, where lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit asking for refunds {{on behalf of}} a local woman in Cuyahoga County, who had bought Girl You Know It's True. At the time the lawsuit was filed, it was estimated at least 1,000 Ohio residents had bought the album. On 12 August 1991, a proposed settlement of a refund lawsuit in Chicago, Illinois, was rejected. This settlement would have refunded buyers of Milli Vanilli CDs, cassettes, records, or singles. However, the refunds would only be given as a credit for a future Arista release. On 28 August, a new settlement was approved; it refunded those who attended concerts along with those who bought Milli Vanilli recordings. An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the refunded recordings as well. The deadline to claim refunds passed on 8 March 1992.|$|E
25|$|The British wine merchants {{used this}} {{opportunity}} to leverage their strength {{in order to maximize}} profits. In 1727, they grouped together to form a trade association and built the Factory House, a private gentlemen's club, where they could meet and collude on details pertaining to the wine trade. They bought all the wine from growers on credit, holding off payment till the wine was sold. They built large warehouses in Vila Nova de Gaia where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>keep</b> the wine for years aging. Less than scrupulous shippers also committed widespread wine fraud by importing grapes from regions outside the Douro to blend, as well as adding non-grape based wine ingredients like elderberry juice for coloring and dried pimentos to add spicy flavors. These tactics increased the leverage of the British shippers and meant they could set whatever prices they wanted to pay the Portuguese grape growers. To ensure more fair pricing, the growers often had to resort to more unorthodox business dealings such as the prostitution of their daughters to the British shippers.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{efforts to}} keep the band going by auditioning for new singers, the band {{realized}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>keep</b> going, and eventually went their separate ways in 1999.
