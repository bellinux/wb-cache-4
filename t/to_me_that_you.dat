5|$|It is {{very obvious}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must remove Sir George Prevost. I see {{he has gone}} to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly {{the best of their}} rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E

500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, prove <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I {{think a lot of}} Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

Now {{you do not}} wish <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had laid any {{restraint}} upon her to keep her with <b>you,</b> or <b>that</b> there was anything to warrant you doing so. For instance, you do not wish <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had bought her?" ...|$|R

500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though {{he might be a}} bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

"It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> sir {{consider}} the folk, whose blood has been feeding and giving lustre {{to all the}} boyar kin, to be in fact nothing, and that you only view the pillagers to be the motherland... But how come you sir do not {{consider the}} motherland to be in fact the people, and not the pillagers' clique?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News said to Ellison, [...] "I {{have been}} nervous about this {{interview}} with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are not working}} with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I {{think a lot of}} Americans will feel that way." [...] Ellison replied that his constituents, [...] "know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to — need to prove my patriotic stripes." ...|$|E

6000|$|SHE. And {{what about}} Teddy? Do <b>you</b> mean <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are going <b>to</b> beat Teddy before my {{face like a}} brutal prizefighter? ...|$|R
2500|$|When pressed {{about this}} again later, some sharp exchanges resulted. Bisbee said [...] "the Court doesn't even {{really need to}} reach that question". [...] "Suppose we {{think we need to}} reach that decision" [...] he was told. [...] "e didn't take this case to {{determine}} who said what in the cafeteria. We determine this case to see what the rule of law ought to be if an employer acts on reasonable, substantiated information, but is wrong." [...] Bisbee suggested that the Seventh Circuit had perhaps used [...] "language that was broader than it needed to", to which O'Connor responded that it might need to be sent back since even he declined to defend their legal theory. [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can affirm the judgment and say that the legal test employed by the Seventh Circuit was not altogether correct," [...] he proposed.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1326, after a journey of over , Ibn Battuta arrived {{at the port of}} Alexandria, at the time part of the Bahri Mamluk empire. He met two ascetic pious men in Alexandria. One was Sheikh Burhanuddin who is {{supposed}} to have foretold the destiny of Ibn Battuta as a world traveller saying [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are fond of foreign travel. You will visit my brother Fariduddin in India, Rukonuddin in Sind and Burhanuddin in China. Convey my greetings to them". Another pious man Sheikh Murshidi interpreted the meaning of a dream of Ibn Battuta that he {{was meant to be a}} world traveller. He spent several weeks visiting sites in the area, and then headed inland to Cairo, the capital of the Mamluk Sultanate and an important city. After spending about a month in Cairo, he embarked on the first of many detours within the relative safety of Mamluk territory. Of the three usual routes to Mecca, Ibn Battuta chose the least-travelled, which involved a journey up the Nile valley, then east to the Red Sea port of Aydhab. Upon approaching the town, however, a local rebellion forced him to turn back.|$|E

6000|$|She looked, however, as if {{she caught}} me in a {{weakness}} here. [...] "Then why did <b>you</b> say <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> should reconsider----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> promise <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> won't go {{walking with}} Mr. Libby any more; and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> won't even see him alone, after this." ...|$|R
