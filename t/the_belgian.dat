5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following a resolution of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. <b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Piron served {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of Belgium (10–28May 1940), after which <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Army surrendered and Belgium was placed under military occupation. Piron, however, {{refused to accept}} <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> surrender and succeeded in escaping from occupied Belgium via France and Spain to British Gibraltar. He arrived in Scotland in February 1942.|$|E
5|$|For {{his service}} in the war, he was {{appointed}} an aide-de-camp to the King in 1916, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1917. He was also made a Commander of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Order of Leopold, and awarded both <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> and French Croix de Guerre.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May 1940, German forces invaded neutral Belgium {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war. Leopold headed immediately to Fort Breendonk, {{the headquarters of}} <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> army near Mechelen, {{to take control of}} the army. He refused to address <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I. The speed of the German advance, using the new Blitzkrieg approach, soon pushed <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> army westwards despite British and French support.

5|$|Such {{an order}} ignored {{the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Army could not {{withdraw}} to the Yser, and there was little chance of any Belgian Cavalry joining in the attack. The plan for <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> withdrawal was sound; the Yser river covered Dunkirk {{to the east and}} south, while the La Bassée Canal covered it from the west. The ring of the Yser also dramatically shorted <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Army's area of operations. Such a move would have abandoned Passchendaele and Ypres and would have certainly meant the capture of Ostend while further reducing the amount of Belgian territory still free by a few square miles.|$|E

5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Congo enabled <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most {{other states in}} exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It also meant that <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> Congo {{remained}} {{loyal to}} <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> government in London and contributed significant material {{and human resources}} to the Allied cause. Many Belgians were involved in both armed and passive resistance to German forces, although some chose to collaborate with the German forces. Support from far right political factions and sections of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> population allowed the German army to recruit two divisions of the Waffen-SS from Belgium and also facilitated the Nazi persecution of Belgian Jews in which nearly 25,000 were killed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> Naval Corps (Corps de Marine) was resurrected in 1939. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> {{merchant}} fleet, some 100 ships, evaded capture by the Germans. Under {{the terms}} of a Belgian–Royal Navy agreement, these ships and their 3,350 crewmen were placed under British control for the duration of hostilities. The General Headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Admiralty was at Ostend under the command of Major Henry Decarpentrie. The First Naval Division was based at Ostend, while the Second and Third divisions were based at Zeebrugge and Antwerp.|$|E

5|$|Upon <b>the</b> {{official}} <b>Belgian</b> {{withdrawal from}} <b>the</b> Western Alliance, <b>the</b> <b>Belgians</b> refused {{to engage in}} any official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. <b>The</b> <b>Belgians</b> did not regard a German invasion as inevitable and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively resisted by new fortifications such as Eben Emael.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> {{army had}} {{traditionally}} used French-style uniforms, {{along with the}} characteristic Adrian helmet, meaning that from the First World War both armies had a very similar appearance. After the war, influenced by the Free Belgians and by British military advisors, <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> military instead adopted British-style uniforms and British-produced equipment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. As {{far as he was}} concerned, <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position in order to keep contact with <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E

5|$|The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> {{government}} {{was installed in}} Eaton Square in the Belgravia area of London, which before the war had been the location of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Embassy.

The offices of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> government were situated close to other governments-in-exile, including Luxembourg, in Wilton Crescent, and the Netherlands in Picadilly.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} was {{also involved in}} the provision of social, educational and cultural institutions to Belgian refugees. In 1942, the government sponsored the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Institute in London to entertain <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> refugee community in London. By 1943, there were also four Belgian schools in Britain with 330 pupils between them, in Penrith, Braemar, Kingston and Buxton.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Congo (the modern-day Democratic Republic of Congo) in World War II {{began with the}} German invasion of Belgium in May 1940. Despite Belgium's surrender, the Congo remained in the conflict on the Allied side, administered by <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> government in exile, and provided much-needed raw materials, most notably gold and uranium, to Britain and the United States.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} governments in exile, which {{were forced to}} rely {{exclusively}} on financial support from the Allies, <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> government in exile could fund itself independently. In large part, {{this was due to}} the fact that the government in exile retained control of most of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> national gold reserves. These had been moved secretly to Britain in May 1940 aboard the naval trawler A4, and provided an important asset. <b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> government was also in control of <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Congo, which exported large amounts of raw materials (including rubber, gold and uranium) which the Allies relied on for the war effort.|$|E
5|$|While most of Belgium was occupied, King Albert I {{continued}} to command <b>the</b> <b>Belgian</b> Army along {{a section of}} the Western Front, known as the Yser Front, through West Flanders from his headquarters in Veurne. <b>The</b> <b>Belgian</b> government, led by Charles de Broqueville, established itself in exile in Le Havre in northern France.
