40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly important to address {{the long-term effects of}} exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> microgravity as the potential for space tourism and life in space become prominent topics amongst the World's governments. There are several studies examining the effects of exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> microgravity on various developmental systems and in various organisms; however, few examine the effects beyond the juvenile stages. In this study, we expose zebrafish embryos <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> microgravity starting at key stages associated with cranial neural crest cell migration. We then analyzed the skeletons of adult fish. Gross observations and morphometric analyses show that exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> microgravity results in stunted growth, reduced ossification and severe distortion of some skeletal elements. Additionally, we investigated the effects on the juvenile skull and body pigmentation. This study determines {{for the first time the}} long-term effects of embryonic exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> microgravity on the developing skull and highlights the importance of studies investigating the effects of altered gravitational forces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFew {{in vitro}} {{screening}} assays for biological activities of plant extracts consider the potential {{effect of the}} gastrointestinal system on orally consumed plant extracts. Crude water and methanol extracts of Tarchonanthus camphoratus (wild camphor) and Agathosma betulina (‘buchu’) were prepared and exposed <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid during dissolution studies to address this aspect. The crude extracts and resulting simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid products were screened for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420). The T. camphoratus crude extract exhibited antimicrobial activity which was reduced after exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastric fluid. After exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> intestinal fluid no antimicrobial activity was detected, which suggests chemical alteration or degradation of the active compounds. For A. betulina, the crude water extract and simulated gastric fluid product exhibited no antimicrobial activity, while the simulated intestinal fluid product exhibited antimicrobial activity. This suggests activation of antimicrobial constituents during exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> intestinal fluid. The chemical composition profiles of the crude extracts and products were determined by means of liquid chromatography coupled to an ultraviolet detector (LC-UV) and a mass spectrometer (LC-MS) to qualitatively assess the effect of exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastrointestinal conditions on the chemical composition of the extracts. In many cases, the peak area of compounds decreased after exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid, while the peak area of other compounds increased. Thus, it can be deduced that the antimicrobial activity and chemical composition was altered after exposure to intestinal conditions during dissolution studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the coating of pectin microparticles containing Lactobacillus acidophilus La 5 with whey protein heat treated or without heat treatment affects the viability of probiotics when exposed <b>to</b> conditions <b>simulating</b> the passage through the gastrointestinal tract. The microparticles were produced by ionotropic gelation and coated with whey protein by electrostatic interaction. The microparticle morphology and the viability of L. acidophilus La 5 during exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastric (pH 1. 2 or 3. 0) and intestinal (pH 7. 0) conditions were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the viability of L. acidophilus La 5 after encapsulation, which was in the order of 8 log 10 CFU/g for all the microparticles. The pectin microparticles remained intact when exposed <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastrointestinal conditions at pH 1. 2, 3. 0 and after 300 min at pH 7. 0. On the other hand, both microparticles coated with whey protein heat treated or without heat treatment have remained intact for 120 min exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastric juice but have disintegrated after 300 min exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> intestinal juice (pH 7. 0). This occurrence suggests that the probiotics would be released in a different part of the intestinal tract whether delivered by one microparticle or another. Microencapsulation conferred greater protective effect to L. acidophilus as compared to the free cells. However, the coating of pectin microparticles with whey protein did not confer additional protection to probiotics when exposed <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> gastrointestinal conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of conidial pigmentation to solar UV radiation tolerance in the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae, was estimated {{by comparing the}} effects of exposure <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> solar UV radiation on the wild-type parent strain U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) -Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures (ARSEF) 23, which has dark green conidia, and three groups of color mutants with yellow, purple and white conidia. The comparisons included inactivation levels and the kinetics of germination of conidia exposed or not exposed <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> solar UV radiation. In addition to significantly inactivating the conidia of different mutants, exposure to radiation delayed for several hours the germination of surviving conidia of the wild type and all mutants. In general, mutants with white conidia were more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> solar UV radiation than mutants with purple conidia, which were more sensitive than mutants with yellow conidia, which in turn were more sensitive than the green wild strain. A significant variation in tolerance <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> solar radiation was observed among mutants within each color group, particularly among mutants with yellow conidia. Revertants with green conidia, DWR 179 and DWR 176, {{were obtained from the}} very sensitive UV mutants DWR 148 (yellow conidia) and DWR 149 (purple conidia), respectively. These revertants had levels of tolerance <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> solar UV radiation {{similar to those of the}} wild-type ARSEF 23. This observation is strong evidence of the {{importance of}} green conidial pigmentation for tolerance <b>to</b> <b>simulated</b> solar UV radiation, a factor that could be manipulated to produce M. anisopliae strains with more tolerance to solar UV radiation...|$|R
