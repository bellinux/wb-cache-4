25|$|As {{the stars}} of Alpha Centauri {{approach}} the Solar System, the measured proper motion and <b>trigonometric</b> <b>parallax</b> slowly increase. Changes are also observed {{in the size of}} the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse, increasing by 0.03arcsec per century. This small effect is gradually decreasing until the star system is at its closest to Earth, and is then reversed as the distance increases again. Consequently, the observed position angles of the stars are subject to changes in the orbital elements over time, as first determined by W. H. van den Bos in 1926.=μα×sinα×(t−to), where; α= right ascension (in degrees), μα is the common proper motion (cpm.) expressed in degrees, and θ and θo are the current position angle and calculated position angle at the different epochs. Some slight differences of about 0.5 percent in the measured proper motions are caused by Alpha Centauri AB's orbital motion.|$|E

40|$|A {{history is}} given of the {{discovery}} between 1914 and 1935 of stars of intermediate luminosity between giants and dwarfs with spectral types between G 0 to K 3.

Called "subgiants" by Strömberg, these 90 stars defined the group at the time.

40|$|International audienceThe nearby TW Hydrae Association (TWA) is {{currently}} a benchmark {{for the study of}} formation and evolution of young low-mass stars, circumstellar disks and the imaging detection of planetary companions. For such studies, it is crucial to evaluate the distance to group members in order to access their physical properties. Membership of several stars is strongly debated and age estimates vary from one author to another with doubts about coevality. We revisit the kinematic properties of the TWA in light of new <b>trigonometric</b> <b>parallaxes</b> and proper motions to derive the dynamical age of the association and physical parameters of kinematic members. Using observations performed with the NTT/ESO telescope we measured <b>trigonometric</b> <b>parallaxes</b> and proper motions for 13 stars in TWA. With the convergent point method we identify a co-moving group with 31 TWA stars. We deduce kinematic distances for 7 members of the moving group that lack <b>trigonometric</b> <b>parallaxes.</b> A traceback strategy is applied to the stellar space motions of a selection of 16 of the co-moving objects with accurate and reliable data yielding a dynamical age for the association of t = 7. 5 +/- 0. 7 Myr. Using our new parallaxes and photometry available in the literature we derive stellar ages and masses from theoretical evolutionary models. With new parallax and proper motion measurements from this work and current astrometric catalogs we provide an improved and accurate database for TWA stars to be used in kinematical analysis. We conclude that the dynamical age obtained via traceback strategy is consistent with previous age estimates for the TWA, and is also compatible with the average ages derived in the present paper from evolutionary models for pre-main sequence stars...|$|R
