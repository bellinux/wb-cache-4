5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both <b>the</b> <b>culprits</b> in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious {{a few hundred yards}} away.|$|E
50|$|The Junior Detective League {{are taken}} to a police conference because they were {{witnesses}} {{to tell them the}} details of the man. However, the conference goes nowhere as Amy, Mitch, and George disagree on how <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> looked. Amy claims <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was a middle aged man, Mitcheck claims <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was {{a young man with a}} black umbrella, and Georder says <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was a beautiful woman with a green umbrella. Conan later says that <b>the</b> <b>culprit's</b> raincoat and umbrella were both a shade of gray, and remembers the umbrella was in his/her right hand, showing that <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was left-handed.|$|R
5000|$|That two {{eyewitness}} reports regarding <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> and <b>the</b> kidnapped girl (which contradicted Sugaya's confession) had {{not been}} presented in court (the descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> were later found to match security camera footage of <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> in other cases) ...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} to do with {{eyewitness}} suspect ID. Later, you will be shown five photo-spread lineups, one for each of the crime videos you just watched. As in the real-world, each lineup will include a suspect but it is possible that in {{one or more of the}} lineups the suspect will not be <b>the</b> <b>culprit.</b> <b>The</b> ideal witness identifies <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> if present in the lineup, and rejects the lineup if <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> is not present.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not <b>the</b> <b>culprits.</b> By Monday, the police had theorized that the murder occurred {{on the second floor}} (the same as Frank's office) based on hair found on a lathe and what appeared to be blood on the ground of the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{found out}} that very weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals {{are to blame for}} the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>culprits</b> consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E
5|$|SBASE, {{along with}} the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, have adopted a zero {{tolerance}} policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400–6000 and up to 30 days community service, <b>the</b> <b>culprits</b> often being made to clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.|$|E
50|$|In Tropical Land, <b>the</b> actual <b>culprit</b> later attacks Rachel but Agasa {{tries to}} protect her and gets shot. Conan hurries and rushes to her aid and quickly takes her deep into Tropical Land, and <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> gives chase. When <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> later pins them down to a volcano, Conan reveals his deduction, and also reveals <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was <b>the</b> psychiatrist, Kyosuke Kazato, who killed Jinno as revenge for having injured his hands to ruin his {{promising}} career, then kept killing to cover his leads—which is why he wanted Rachel dead, as she managed to witness his last murder and see his face clearly despite his efforts.|$|R
50|$|Holmes tells Lestrade to tell Harker, a {{journalist}} for the Central Press Syndicate, {{that he is}} convinced that <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> is a lunatic. Holmes knows {{that this is not}} true, but it is expedient to use the press to convince <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> that this is what the investigators believe.|$|R
50|$|He {{reveals that}} <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was not Murakami {{due to the}} fact that Murakami is left-handed, but <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was right-handed. He reveals that Kohei Sawaki is <b>the</b> <b>culprit.</b> He notes Sawaki has Aguesia, a {{disorder}} that robs the ability to taste. He supports this by the fact Sawaki was tasting chili pepper, while a regular sommelier would never do something like this. He also mentions that while Conan brought mineral water to the crew, Sawaki's cup was the only one with salt. He actually strangled Murakami to death.|$|R
5|$|Days later, Lebowski {{contacts}} the Dude {{stating that}} Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude {{to deliver a}} briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom {{and see if he}} can recognize <b>the</b> <b>culprits.</b> Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty underwear. The kidnappers grab the fake ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom money briefcase still inside.|$|E

Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief suspect was British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} species of hawk, owl and falcon {{are known to}} {{occasionally}} predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults {{are likely to be}} urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (Falco columbarius). Common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests, and the lesser honeyguide (Indicator minor), a brood parasite, uses the common starling as a host. Starlings are more commonly <b>the</b> <b>culprits</b> rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by animals capable of climbing to them, such as stoats (Mustela erminea), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.|$|E
50|$|In rabbinic law, capital {{punishment}} {{may only be}} inflicted by the verdict of a regularly constituted court of twenty-three qualified members. There must be the most trustworthy and convincing testimony {{of at least two}} qualified eyewitnesses to the crime, who must also depose that <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> had been forewarned of the criminality and the consequences of his project. <b>The</b> <b>culprit</b> must be a person of legal age and of sound mind, and the crime must be proved to have been committed of <b>the</b> <b>culprit's</b> free will and without the aid of others.|$|R

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully have 24 hours to save Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) from a biologically engineered disease. In order to combat the disease, Scully looks for a medical answer, while Mulder searches for <b>the</b> <b>culprits</b> behind the attack on Skinner's life. To aid him in this task, Mulder visits Senator Matheson, whom he hopes can help him find who is responsible before time runs out.|$|E
5|$|Ticket {{sales for}} the game were {{relatively}} rapid. By Dec. 7, Virginia Tech had sold almost its entire initial allotment of 12,500 tickets, Florida State fans had purchased approximately 6,800 tickets, and total ticket sales neared the 50,000 mark. Tech's sales increased to more than 13,000 by Dec. 14, and Virginia Tech officials requested an initial allotment from the Gator Bowl. Four days later, more than 60,000 tickets had been sold, and there were expectations that the game would be a sellout. The growing demand for tickets was demonstrated by an incident in which nearly 200 all-access passes to the game were stolen in transit from the printer and resold, causing a police search for <b>the</b> <b>culprits.</b>|$|E
5|$|What {{at first}} {{seems to be}} an open-and-shut case becomes {{confused}} though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were <b>the</b> <b>culprits.</b> Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping {{to get to the bottom}} of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny's house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.|$|E
30|$|For {{half of the}} participants, {{all five}} lineups were CA, while for the other half, all five {{contained}} <b>the</b> <b>culprit.</b> <b>The</b> photo of <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> in <b>the</b> CP lineup was a still from {{a portion of the}} video not included in the video clip presented in the study phase, and the photo was edited so that the criminal was wearing clothes like those {{of the rest of the}} lineup members.|$|R
2500|$|Dennis {{was told}} the {{identity}} of <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> minutes before he filmed the scene in which Paul was pushed. He was initially the only cast member who knew for [...] "quite a while." [...] The actor was sworn to secrecy and {{was not allowed to}} tell any of his co-stars. Dennis admitted that he was forced to lie {{that he did not know}} the identity of Paul's attacker when he was asked. He also said that he was not surprised when <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was revealed to him. When asked if he was surprised at who <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was, Dennis stated that he was not because it was explained to him why it was that person. The other cast members did not find out who <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> was until a couple of weeks after the 6000th episode. Jane Hall later revealed that she had known her character, Rebecca, would be <b>the</b> <b>culprit</b> from <b>the</b> start. She was told by the writers it what was what they had planned. Hall admitted to thinking that the storyline would be [...] "really tricky" [...] as it goes against her character's nature.|$|R

5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so the search is narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that someone close to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) {{but they are not}} <b>the</b> <b>culprits.</b> They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a conversation about her father.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2013, Wizkid and his {{management}} were questioned by {{men from the}} Nigeria Police Force. Duping charges were leveled against them {{by a group of}} UNILAG students. The students claimed that Wizkid agreed to perform at the UNILAG Sports Centre on 21 May 2013 for a total sum of ₦500,000. They also claimed that he didn't show up for the show and didn't return their money. After conducting a thorough investigation, Police determined that Unilag students were bamboozled by con artists pretending to be affiliates of E.M.E. In the aforementioned interview with Showtime Celebrity, Wizkid commented on the events that transpired after the accusations. He told the media that the police were investigating the case.

5|$|As a newly {{inducted}} {{member of}} the Scions, the player follows Thancred to Thanalan to investigate abductions and the theft of crystals along trade routes in the area. <b>The</b> <b>culprits</b> {{are members of the}} Amalj'aa beast tribe who capture the adventurer to be sacrificed to their primal god, Ifrit. The attempt fails as the Echo protects the player from Ifrit's brainwashing. The adventurer counters by defeating Ifrit and is hailed as a hero, with emissaries from all three Grand Companies jockeying for the privilege of recruiting said hero. While attending rallies at each of the three cities honoring the memory of those fallen at Carteneau, the player meets the twins Alphinaud and Alisaie who question the purpose of such nationalist displays. The adventurer's next mission is to forge relations with the Sylphs of the Black Shroud, a peaceful beast tribe whose radical sect once summoned Ramuh to defend the forest from Garlean incursion. While searching for the Sylph elder, the player encounters Lahabrea for the first time—an immortal Ascian bent on destroying the Mothercrystal. The Scions, Thancred in particular, resolve to investigate this new foe.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must condemn {{the actions of the}} troops and punish <b>the</b> <b>culprits.</b> If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly condemn and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day. Thuận appeared to be astounded and asked Trueheart what blister gas was. Trueheart explained that the symptoms of the victims were consistent with those of mustard gas and passed on the US threat to denounce the regime for the chemical attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 189 BC, {{the hostages}} taken by Rome, {{excluding}} Nabis' son, who fell ill and died, {{were allowed to}} return to Sparta. Still deprived of any port and suffering from political and economic problems from having the hostile exiles close by and not having access to the sea, the Spartans captured the city of Las, which was the home of many exiles {{and a member of the}} Union of free Laconians. The Acheans officially adopted this as the reason to finish Spartan independence once and for all. They demanded the surrender of the people responsible for the attack. <b>The</b> <b>culprits</b> responded by murdering thirty pro-Achaean citizens, seceding from the League and requesting Roman tutelage. The Romans, who wanted to see division in the League, did nothing about the situation. In 188, Philopoemen entered northern Laconia with an army and the Spartan exiles who insisted on returning to Sparta. He first massacred eighty anti-Achaeans at Compasium, and then had the wall that Nabis built around Sparta demolished. Philopoemen then restored the exiles and abolished Spartan law, introducing Achaean law in its place. Thus ended Sparta's role as a major power in Greece, while Achaea became dominant throughout the Peloponnese.|$|E

Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as <b>the</b> <b>culprits,</b> Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy.
