500|$|Ville Valo is {{the main}} {{songwriter}} of HIM and his songs largely deal with themes of love. When talking about his songwriting, Valo stated: [...] "I didn't know {{how to cope with}} the world. Then I found an instrument, and through that I realized, that I am able to cope with the world and its evils, a bit better, through writing songs." [...] In terms of lyrical content, Valo has stated that [...] "I feel like there is no subject more important for a song than relationships. It's the only thing than touches me." [...] Valo also takes inspiration from literature, explaining that [...] "as a guy who writes songs, I get excited about an idea, or a book, or a sentence. I don't necessarily get excited about the whole of Tolkien, I just get excited about Uruk-hai. Just a little detail that just makes my mind work overdrive." [...] Valo and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>HIM</b> have referred to their music as [...] "love metal", the idea of which was to combine more melodic and melancholic elements, with heavier influences, such as Black Sabbath and Type O Negative. Valo has described the music of HIM as [...] "sentimental, hard-hitting rock music".|$|E

60|$|Though {{this was}} all a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired effect. Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with the {{governor}} for his life; and all <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> begged <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for God's sake, {{that they might not}} be sent to England.|$|R
50|$|Frydrych {{was second}} to Thorkildsen once {{more at the}} Adidas Grand Prix in New York City, but a back injury spoiled <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> 2010 for <b>him,</b> and he only placed 10th at the European Championships.|$|R

6000|$|... "He's a boy!" [...] {{said the}} white man, {{shaking his head}} while he spoke, and {{addressing}} the father. [...] "Does he think when a hunter sees {{a part of the}} creatur', he can't tell where <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> should be!" ...|$|E

60|$|On {{his right}} hand, {{always a little}} larger than life, sat the Secretary, 'Down-by-the-starn' Hemmings; an all-too-sad sadness beaming in his fine eyes; his iron-grey beard, in {{mourning}} like <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> giving the feeling of an all-too-black tie behind it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Brahmin or no Brahmin, by my {{soul and}} my father's soul, in you go!" [...] I said, and, seizing {{him by the}} shoulders, I crammed {{his head into the}} mouth of the burrow, kicked <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in, and, sitting down, covered my face with my hands.|$|E

Make of this youth what you will, and you have my full authority for doing so. But remember he is your charge, not mine--remember he hath limbs to do man's service, a soul and a tongue to worship God; breed him, therefore, {{to be true to}} his country and to Heaven; and for <b>the</b> <b>rest,</b> dispose <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as you list--it is, and shall rest, your own matter." ...|$|R
25|$|Hippocrates {{described}} trigonocephaly as follows: Men's {{heads are}} by no means all like to one another, nor are the sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form. Thus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by prominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which projects beyond <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> it), in <b>him</b> <b>the</b> sutures <b>of</b> the head take the form of the Greek letter 'tau', Ï„.|$|R
50|$|In the novel, Gulliver washes up on {{the shore}} of Lilliput and is {{captured}} by the inhabitants while asleep.

Despite a triumphant welcome, he soon finds himself at odds with the Emperor of Lilliput, as he declines to conquer <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Blefuscu for <b>him</b> and to force the Blefuscudians to adopt Little-Endianism.|$|R
60|$|It {{was so far}} a {{description}} of himself {{that he had the}} feet of an Elephant: but <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> was skin and bone: and the wisps of loose straw, that bristled all about him, suggested that he had been originally stuffed with it, and that nearly all the stuffing had come out.|$|E

I therefore seized his body in my arms, threw myself out of the aperture, and began to slide down.|$|E
60|$|The picture alarmed the boy. By {{a little}} stove inside the van sat a figure red {{from head to}} heels--the {{man who had been}} Thomasin's friend.

50|$|If the 1960s was {{the decade}} wherein Somers proved {{himself as a}} composer, the 1970s were the years wherein <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Canada honoured <b>him</b> for that achievement. In 1971, after he {{returned}} to Canada from his work in Rome, Somers was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, due to his national and international recognition as a composer. He was awarded three honorary doctorates; one from the University of Ottawa (1975), one from York University (1975) and one from the University of Toronto (1976).|$|R
25|$|At {{the deli}} counter, a patron recognizes Randy as the wrestler, though he denies it.

Spurred by the fan's recognition <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and with nothing left, Randy decides to return to wrestling and reschedules the rematch with The Ayatollah. He reconciles with Cassidy, though she begs him not to wrestle because of his heart condition. However, Randy explains to her that he belongs in the ring with the fans who, unlike <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> society, love <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Now, {{upon your}} hypothesis, we must add; {{that even the}} Son of God [...] himself, however divine he may be thought, is really no God at all in [...] any just and proper sense. He {{is no more than}} a nominal God, and [...] stands {{excluded}} with <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> All worship <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and reliance upon [...] him, will be idolatry, as much as the worship of angels, or men, or of [...] the gods of the heathen would be. God the Father he is God, and he [...] only, and 'him only shall thou serve'. This I take to be a clear [...] consequence from your principles, and unavoidable.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh bother!' she said. 'I can't draw {{all of a}} carp-fish, but I {{can draw}} {{something}} that means a carp-fish's mouth.

Here's just his mouth, and that means ah.' And she drew this. (1.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew I was a poet," [...] cried Syme {{in a sort}} of ecstasy. [...] "I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope. It was the {{spectacles}} {{that did}} it!

60|$|Peter {{looked up}} to see a bird a little smaller than Welcome Robin. His head, throat and back were black. His wings were black with patches of white on them. But it was his breast that made Peter catch his breath with a little gasp of admiration, for that breast was a {{beautiful}} rose-red. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> underneath was white. It was Rosebreast the Grosbeak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Van Artevelde {{committed}} to the two English knights the task of seizing all the gates, and of setting a guard to prevent any man from leaving, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> us under <b>him</b> pushed forward to the market-place. There was no resistance. Thousands {{of the men had}} fallen in the battle and flight. Thousands had failed to enter the gates. All who did so were utterly panic-stricken and terrified. Thus the five thousand men you sent out have defeated forty thousand, and have captured Bruges, and I verily believe that not more than a score have fallen. Methinks, my friends, you will all agree with me that your governor has done well to give these knights the honour of carrying the good news to Ghent." ...|$|R

2500|$|Fight {{follows the}} same theme as the band's {{previous}} album by continuing a mixture of generic Jpop, pop/rock, and R styles. While not as mature in sound as their last album, Fight is more upbeat and faster, following {{the feeling of the}} excitement of a sports game; which is the album's image theme. The album opens up with [...] "Monjai Beat", a fast pop/rock song with Ska influences. You Yokoyama yells, [...] " [...] Eight! Home run!! [...] ", followed by <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> band echoing <b>him,</b> setting the entire 'baseball' theme for the album. The second track on the album, [...] "UchÅ« ni Ikitta Lion", slows the pace down just a bit with a standard pop/rock style and uses the falsettos of Ryuhei Maruyama and Shota Yasuda for the repeating, [...] "Far away", on the track. The title song and third track off of the album, [...] "Fight for the Eight", begins with a rough guitar riff before being joined with a drum beat. Vocally, the song is carried by the harmonies of each member, having them duet within a relative key to each other.|$|R
60|$|There {{it was in}} a nutshell. The {{eyes had}} clearly come apart from <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and were on their own. My heart pounded and my breath choked in my windpipe. I had {{stumbled}} on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they belonged to the same species.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the wearing}} of a bright red tie would have been unexpected--a bright red tie after the fashion of a South-Western railway guard's! <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> by no means dandiacal, even the vanity of glasses long since abandoned. You would have reflected.... Where had you seen a crowd--red ties {{abundant}} and in some way significant? The truth has to be told. Mr. Lewisham had become a Socialist! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} a motor {{carriage}} with liveried servants drew {{up at the}} emporium entrance; a large lady, with a penetrating and rather hurried manner of talking, stepped out, followed slowly and sulkily by a small boy, who had a very black scowl {{on his face and}} a very white sailor suit over <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The lady was continuing an argument which had probably commenced in Portman Square.|$|E
50|$|Cena {{was later}} forced to join The Nexus, {{as a result}} of losing to Barrett at Hell in a Cell. At the {{following}} pay-per-view, Bragging Rights on October 24, Otunga and Cena teamed together to win the WWE Tag Team Championship from Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre. The next night on Raw Otunga and Cena lost the Tag Team Championship to fellow Nexus members Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater when Barrett ordered Otunga to allow Slater to pin him. On November 5, Otunga, who had been questioning Barrett's leadership in the past weeks, led Nexus, minus Barrett and Cena, to an invasion of SmackDown. Barrett did not approve of Otunga's decision to lead The Nexus to SmackDown and as a result forced him to defend his spot in the group a week later. On the November 12 edition of SmackDown Otunga defeated Edge in a lumberjack match, after Kane interfered, to keep his spot in Nexus. About a month later, Otunga started to rebel against Barrett with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Nexus behind <b>him.</b> After the group disobeyed direct orders and walked away from Barrett, Otunga told Barrett to rehire Cena the following week or be banished from Nexus.|$|R
60|$|But I am {{sensible}} I have presumed too far {{to entertain}} you with a rude discourse of that art, which you both know so well, {{and put into practice}} with so much happiness. Yet before I leave Virgil, I must own the vanity to tell you, and by you the world, that he has been my master in this poem: I have followed him everywhere, I know not with what success, but I am sure with diligence enough: my images are many of them copied from him, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> are imitations <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> My expressions also are as near as the idioms of the two languages would admit of in translation. And this, sir, I have done with that boldness, for which I will stand accountable to any of our little critics, who, perhaps, are no better acquainted with him than I am. Upon your first perusal of this poem, you have taken notice of some words which I have innovated (if it be too bold for me to say refined) upon his Latin; which, as I offer not to introduce into English prose, so I hope they are neither improper, nor altogether inelegant in verse; and, in this, Horace will again defend me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, without doubt! We can't {{put it all}} on the {{conditions}}; we {{must put}} some of the blame on character. But conditions make character; and people are greedy and foolish, and wish to have and to shine, because having and shining are held up to them by civilization as the chief good of life. We all know they are not the chief good, perhaps not good at all; but if some one ventures to say so, all <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> us call <b>him</b> a fraud and a crank, and go moiling and toiling on to the palace or the poor-house. We can't help it. If one were less greedy or less foolish, some one else would have and would shine at his expense. We don't moil and toil to ourselves alone; the palace or the poor-house is not merely for ourselves, but for our children, whom we've brought up in the superstition that having and shining is the chief good. We dare not teach them otherwise, for fear they may falter in the fight when it comes their turn, and the children of others will crowd them out of the palace into the poor-house. If we felt sure that honest work shared by all would bring them honest food shared by all, some heroic few of us, who did not wish our children to rise above their fellows--though we could not bear to have them fall below--might trust them with the truth. But we have no such assurance, and so we go on trembling before Dryfooses and living in gimcrackeries." ...|$|R
