He {{was told he}} was still wait-listed, and was offered alternative arrangements, which he declined. At 15:50 UTC (7:50am), M. Singh checked into a busy line of 30 people for the CP flight from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18am. He asked agent Jeannie Adams to check his dark brown, hard-sided Samsonite suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. The agent initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to Montreal and from Montreal to Bombay was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, [...] "Your ticket doesn't read that you're confirmed" [...] and [...] "we're not supposed <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>your</b> baggage through." [...] The man said, [...] "Wait, I'll get my brother for you." [...] As he started to walk away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but {{told him he would}} have to check in again with Air India in Toronto. After the crash, Adams would realise this deception got the bag on its way to Flight 182. The anxious man was never identified. At 16:18 UTC (9:18am), Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 to Toronto Pearson International Airport departed without Singh.|$|E

60|$|Siron's inn, that {{excellent}} artists' barrack, was managed upon easy principles. At any {{hour of the}} night, {{when you}} returned from wandering in the forest, {{you went to the}} billiard-room and helped yourself to liquors, or descended to the cellar and returned laden with beer or wine. The Sirons were all locked in slumber; there was none <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>your</b> inroads; only at the week's end a computation was made, the gross sum was divided, and a varying share set down to every lodger's name under the rubric: estrats. Upon the more long-suffering the larger tax was levied; and your bill lengthened in a direct proportion to the easiness of your disposition. At any hour of the morning, again, you could get your coffee or cold milk, and set forth into the forest. The doves had perhaps wakened you, fluttering into your chamber; and on the threshold of the inn you were met by the aroma of the forest. Close by were the great aisles, the mossy boulders, the interminable field of forest shadow. There you were free to dream and wander. And at noon, and again at six o'clock, a good meal awaited you on Siron's table. The whole of your accommodation, set aside that varying item of the estrats, cost you five francs a day; your bill was never offered you until you asked it; and if you were out of luck's way, you might depart for where you pleased and leave it pending.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Targeted {{chlamydia}} screening {{has been}} advocated to reduce chlamydia associated reproductive sequelae. General practitioners are {{well positioned to}} play a major role in chlamydia control. The primary aim of this pilot study was to measure the effect of offering an online sexual health assessment tool, Youth <b>Check</b> <b>Your</b> Risk, on chlamydia testing rates among young people attending general practices. The secondary aim was to test the acceptability of the tool among general practitioners and young people. Methods General practitioners at three practices in Melbourne, Australia, referred patients aged 16 to 24 years <b>to</b> Youth <b>Check</b> <b>Your</b> Risk [URL] for use post-consultation between March to October 2007. The proportion of young people tested for chlamydia before and during the implementation of the tool was compared. Acceptability was assessed through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire with general practitioners, and anonymous online data provided by Youth <b>Check</b> <b>Your</b> Risk users. Results The intervention did not result in any significant increases in the proportion of 16 to 24 year old males (2. 7 % to 3. 0 %) or females (6. 3 % to 6. 4 %) tested for chlamydia. A small increase in the proportion of 16 to 19 year old females tested was seen (4. 1 % to 7. 2 %). Of the 2997 patients seen during the intervention phase, 871 (29. 1 %) were referred <b>to</b> Youth <b>Check</b> <b>Your</b> Risk and 120 used it (13. 8 %). Major reasons for low referral rates reported by practitioners included lack of time, discomfort with raising the issue of testing, and difficulty in remembering to refer patients. Conclusion Offering an online sexual risk assessment tool in general practice did not significantly increase the proportion of young people tested for chlamydia, with GPs identifying a number of barriers to referring young people <b>to</b> Youth <b>Check</b> <b>Your</b> Risk. Future interventions aimed at increasing chlamydia screening in general practice with the aid of an online risk assessment tool need to identify and overcome barriers to testing. </p...|$|R
