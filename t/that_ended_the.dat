After calling at that British port on 9 December, American docked at Marseilles, before leaving for New York in the new year, arriving there on 9 February 1919. American was decommissioned and returned to American-Hawaiian on 4 March, and formally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw {{the parties involved}} agree to a four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E

5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} three seasons, the Rockets were {{eliminated}} three straight times {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, with the first of those in 1988, the Dallas Mavericks defeating the Rockets in four games, leading to Fitch's dismissal. Don Chaney was hired to replace him and lead the Rockets to the playoffs in his first season in Houston, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics in four games thanks to a buzzer-beater <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> Rockets season.|$|E
5|$|In the West German federal {{election}} of 1953, Rudel, who {{had returned to}} West Germany, was the top candidate for the far-right German Reich Party but was not elected to the Bundestag. Following the Revolución Libertadora in 1955, the uprising <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> second presidential term of Perón, Rudel moved to Paraguay, where he acted as a foreign representative for several German companies. In 1977, he became {{a spokesman for the}} German People's Union, a neo-Nazi political party founded by the extremist politician Gerhard Frey. Rudel died in West Germany in 1982.|$|E

The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of newsprint, as paper mills {{were not able to}} meet the demand {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was going out of business.|$|E
5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953. He had accomplished this task by deft political maneuvering between {{both the left and}} the right to achieve what no other ruler or political group in Indochina had managed, a relatively bloodless transition to independence. During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance while at the same time maintaining his nation's neutrality (guaranteed by the 1954 Geneva Conference <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> First Indochina War).|$|E
5|$|The 1793 Second Partition of Poland was {{the second}} of three {{partitions}} (or partial annexations) <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. The second partition occurred {{in the aftermath of}} the War in Defense of the Constitution and the Targowica Confederation of 1792, and was approved by its territorial beneficiaries, the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. The division was ratified by the coerced Polish parliament (Sejm) in 1793 (see the Grodno Sejm) in a short-lived attempt to prevent the inevitable complete annexation of Poland, the Third Partition.|$|E

5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic {{during the summer}} and fall. There were three suspected tropical depressions, including one that began the season in February and one <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Storm data is largely based on the Atlantic hurricane database, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The 45th Infantry Division guardsmen saw {{no major}} action until they {{became one of}} the first National Guard units {{activated}} in World War II in 1941. They took part in intense fighting during the invasion of Sicily and the attack on Salerno in the 1943 Italian Campaign. Slowly advancing through Italy, they fought in Anzio and in Monte Cassino. After landing in France during Operation Dragoon, they joined the 1945 drive into Germany <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> War in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{assault was}} preceded by a massive artillery bombardment {{that was meant to}} soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|By early April, Michigan {{was back}} in service; {{for the next several}} months, she {{primarily}} trained gunners in the Chesapeake Bay. While on a convoy escort that had left the United States on 30 September, the ship's port screw fell off. She was forced to leave the convoy on 8 October and return to port for repairs. She was out of service {{for the rest of the}} war. In November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> <b>the</b> fighting in Europe. Michigan was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force in late December 1918 to ferry American soldiers back from Europe.
