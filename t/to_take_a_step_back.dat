25|$|Poincaré {{states that}} {{mathematics}} (analysis) and physics {{are in the}} same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period {{for the rest of}} the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E

The group was due to tour the UK with Brand New in May and June, however, all of the shows were {{cancelled}} amongst rumours of the band breaking up. In early May, the group issued a statement, explaining that [...] "There have {{been a series of}} personal events with members of the band ... We need very much <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> at this time". Around this time, Nolan (citing exhaustion from touring) left the band, and Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were [...] "having trouble because everything was happening so fast. Going from being home ... to being gone all the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle". The band briefly considered breaking up. Nolan and Cooper formed Straylight Run with Nolan's sister, Michelle, and Breaking Pangaea drummer Will Noon.|$|E

Their first project was Elena (2011) from director Andrey Zvyagintsev. As part of a Blu-ray release of the Quay brothers animated work, Nolan directed the documentary short Quay (2015). He also initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' In Absentia, The Comb and Street of Crocodiles. The program and Nolan's short received critical acclaim, with Indiewire writing in their review that the brothers [...] "will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that The Quay Brothers in 35mm will always be one of latter's most important contributions to cinema". In 2015, Nolan joined The Film Foundation's board of directors, a non-profit organization dedicated to film preservation. Having been instrumental in keeping the production of film stock alive in the 21st century, Nolan invited over 30 representatives from leading American film archives, labs and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled Reframing the Future of Film at the Getty Museum in March 2015. On 7 May, it was announced that Nolan and Martin Scorsese had been appointed by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) as DGA representatives. In 2016, Nolan and Thomas opted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> and only serve as executive producers on Zack Snyder's [...] (2016), the sequel to Man of Steel. Later that year, Nolan was featured in the documentary Cinema Futures (2016) by Austrian filmmaker Michael Palm.|$|E

Richmond earned derision when they asked Footscray for a clearance fee for his services – [...] Hart quickly recalled the price they had paid to get him to Melbourne in the first place. Hart's stint at the club was troubled. He set very high fitness standards and summarily sacked players who couldn't meet those standards, turning over many players in the process.

2500|$|The basic step of lindy hop, a swingout, is {{the basis}} {{of a large number of}} the {{traditional}} lindy hop moves and is done to eight counts of music. While the basic step is generally universally similar, the resurgence on lindy hop in the 1990s lead to two distinctly different styles of the basic step: the [...] "Brooklyn" [...] style and the [...] "smooth" [...] style. In the Brooklyn style of the basic step, the lead leads a follow <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>back</b> on the first count of the step (similar to the footwork of the basic step in east coast) whereas, in the smooth style, a lead leads the follow to take a step forward on that same first count. From scene to scene, dancers are often familiar with completely different styles, steps, moves, and patterns of lindy hop. When a number of local scenes come together in events such as a lindy exchange, dancers can often be seen exchanging dance moves with one another.|$|E
2500|$|The Memphis Tour {{was held}} during February and March 2008. The tour began on 26 February with two concerts at The Bridge Hotel, Sydney, {{followed}} by sixteen further concerts in mainly theatre venues around Australia.

These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them."

[...] One of the Melbourne concerts was filmed for a live DVD/CD titled The Memphis Tour. Sebastian was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Performance in an Australian Contemporary Concert for The Memphis Tour, and was awarded two Australian Club Entertainment Awards, best Original Music Performer and Outstanding Club Performer of the Year.
