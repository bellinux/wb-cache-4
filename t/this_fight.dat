5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons.

In <b>this</b> <b>fight,</b> the two brothers relied upon the Uqaylis; after the defeat of Badh, the Banu Uqayl turned on the Hamdanids and deposed and killed Abu Tahir Ibrahim, establishing the Uqaylid Dynasty as the rulers of the Jazira.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean force {{eventually}} withdrew {{after several}} unsuccessful attacks, having suffered heavy casualties. As it was disengaging from Masan, US Air Force aircraft caught the North Korean truck columns {{as they were}} retreating, inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties. <b>This</b> <b>fight,</b> {{with a number of}} smaller engagements in the region, effectively stopped the North Korean offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. It also gave both sides a reprieve from the fighting to resupply and re-enforce before engaging in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him. <b>This</b> <b>fight</b> did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E
5|$|The press {{would not}} meet Dalton and d'Abo until 5 October 1986, when the main unit {{travelled}} to Vienna.

During the course of the three days it took to film <b>this</b> <b>fight,</b> Weston fractured a finger and Wisniewski knocked him out once. The next day found the crew on location at Stonor House, doubling for Bladen's Safe House, the first scene Jeroen Krabbé filmed.|$|E

His {{headquarters}} in Falmouth, Virginia, was described by cavalry officer Charles F. Adams, Jr., as being a combination of a [...] "bar-room and a brothel". He built a network of loyal political cronies that included Maj. Gen. Dan Butterfield for chief of staff, and the notorious political general, Maj. Gen. Daniel E.

Among the abandoned North Korean materiel on the hill, Schauer's men found twenty-five American BARs and submachine guns, a large American radio, thirty boxes of unopened American fragmentation and concussion grenades, and some American rations.|$|E
5|$|This {{iteration}} of Razer {{competed in}} the second series of Robot Wars, successfully passing the Gauntlet and Trials stages of its heat before being defeated in battle by a robot called Inquisitor. The cause of Razer's immobilisation in <b>this</b> <b>fight</b> was the shearing of nylon cush drives—cushioning blocks designed to prevent stress fractures—in the machine's drive wheels; these were replaced with more robust metal ones for future competitions. As the Robot Wars television series evolved and grew, Razer's design was revised and refined to counter weaknesses {{and take advantage of}} rule changes; by series four, Lewis estimated that Razer had taken 1,500 hours to build, at a cost of £1,600.|$|E
5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the yin {{and yang}} due to their notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers {{to look forward to}} Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although he was not sure whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of <b>this</b> <b>fight,</b> the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into <b>this</b> <b>fight</b> due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E

5|$|When first {{introducing}} Sasuke, Kishimoto {{wrote him}} as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers {{due to the fact}} both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan latters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened {{as a result of their}} fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal. Kishimoto drastically changed Sasuke's character, and the plot, by making him one of the series' antagonists, comparing Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of yin and yang because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto made sure the other did too. Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters. He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to look forward the final fight between the two characters. In regards to the fight, Kishimoto wanted to focus on hand-to-hand combat rather than ninja techniques. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of <b>this</b> <b>fight,</b> the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair.

5|$|Carpenter, in <b>this</b> <b>fight</b> {{with others}} of his small {{regiment}} at Fairfield, stood against {{two of the}} crack brigades of Stuart's cavalry. The 6th Cavalry's stand {{was considered one of}} the most gallant in its history and helped influence the outcome the battles being fought around Gettysburg. While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut to pieces, it fought so well that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops. The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force. Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand, the two brigades of Virginians could have caused serious problems to the Union rear areas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1139, rumours were current that the family was going to defect to Stephen's rival for the throne, the Empress Matilda. These rumours {{appear to have been}} started by a group of nobles led by twin {{brothers}} Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, with Alan of Brittany. Whether Roger and his family really intended to switch their support to Matilda is unclear, but unlikely. In late June, a fight broke out between some of the retainers of Alan and men in the service of Roger's family. <b>This</b> <b>fight</b> was the excuse for the king moving against Roger's family. Both the elder and younger Roger were arrested, along with Alexander, but Nigel escaped. Matilda of Ramsbury, who held out in Devizes Castle against the king, was persuaded to surrender the castle to Stephen when the king threatened to hang the younger Roger if she did not yield. The younger Roger was restrained with chains and put on a high platform in view of the castle with a noose around his neck.|$|E
