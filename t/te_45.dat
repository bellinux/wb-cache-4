A set operation time of 14 nsec was achieved in the devices due to the increased probability of the nucleation by the addition of the elemental Bi. The long data retention time of 10 years at 85 oC on the base of 1 % failure was obtained as the result of higher activation energy of 2. 52 eV for the crystallization compared to the case of N 7. 0 (Ge 22. 0 Sb 22. 0 Te 56. 0) film, in which the activation energy is 2. 1 eV. In addition, a reset current reduction of 27 % and longer cycles of endurance as much as 2 order of magnitude compared to the case of N 7. 0 (Ge 22. 0 Sb 22. 0 Te 56. 0) were observed at a set operation time of 14 nsec.

After the growth, a standard CdCl 2 treatment {{was applied for}} 30 min at 430 ◦C. The microstructure of the cells was studied by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. A recrystallization after the CdCl 2 treatment was observed not only for CdTe but also for CdS. For all cells, diffusion of S into CdTe and Te in CdS were studied. The presence and distribution of Cl at the interface and at grain boundaries was also investigated. The lattice parameter as an indicator for a compositional change in the CdTe absorber layer after the CdCl 2 treatment was determined from convergent beam electron diffraction. The results were cross-checked with X-ray diffraction and compared with results obtained for a Cd 50 S 5 <b>Te</b> <b>45</b> polycrystal.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 87 - 95. The design, fabrication and {{characterization of}} photonic band gap (PBG) based optical polymer fibers is discussed. Unlike conventional {{total internal reflection}} (TIR) fibers, used primarily in telecommunications, PBG fibers can be made hollow core {{and can be used}} to guide infrared radiation of any wavelength, a property known as wavelength scalability. Since the electromagnetic radiation is transmitted in the hollow core of the fiber, the intrinsic absorption of the fiber core as well as the insertion Fresnel losses at front and end faces are avoided, giving rise to extraordinarily high power densities to be delivered. The fiber production line includes material characterization, and the design of nanoscale quarter wavestacks using common thermoplastic polymers (poly ether sulphone and poly ether imide) and chalcogenide glasses (As 2 S 3, As 2 Se 3, Ge 15 As 25 Se 15 <b>Te</b> <b>45).</b> The fiber preform is fabricated using rolling mechanism of thermally evaporated chalcogenide glasses on large area polymers. Subsequently, the fiber preforms are thermally drawn to obtain nano-structured PBG fibers. Two different fibers are designed and produced, signifying wavelength scalability of the overall process, for the widely used holmium (Ho:YAG) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) medical lasers. The transmission characteristics of the fibers proved that they can be used to safely deliver 15 Wlaser power, along a 3 meter fiber with external diameter of 1. 5 mm and hollow core diameter of 0. 5 mm, corresponding to a laser power density of 1 kW/cm 2 with a loss of - 10 dB/m.

This period was chosen primarily because it was characterized by major changes in public funding and in student : staff ratios.

The analysis indicates that there was a substantial rise in the weighted geometric mean TE score during the study period, although this rise was most noticeable between 1987 / 88 and 1990 / 91. The rising TE scores are attributed largely to the gains in pure technical efficiency and congestion efficiency, with scale efficiency playing a minor role. The Malmquist approach is then used to distinguish between changes in TE and intertemporal shifts in the efficiency frontier. The results reveal that total factor productivity rose by 51. 5 % between 1980 / 81 and 1992 / 93, and that most of this increase was due to a substantial outward shift in the efficiency frontier during this period. ...|$|R

Most importantly such a distortion will destroy the acoustic phase mode being present if the electron-hole pairing and condensation is exclusively driven by the Coulomb interaction.

40|$|Silver {{containing}} chalcogenide glasses {{have been}} extensively studied {{during the last}} few decades; the main interest in these materials being their electrical conductivity which changes by several orders of magnitude upon silver doping. Glassy chalcogenides doped with silver have applications in optical elements, gratings, micro-lenses, waveguides, bio & chemical sensors, solid electrolytes, batteries, etc. Chalcohalide glasses have become important in the recent times, from both scientific & technological points of view, due to the interesting properties exhibited by these glasses such as the transparency in the infrared region, the stability against devitrification, solubility of rare earth elements, etc. In this thesis work, the thermal properties and electrical switching behavior of certain silver and iodine doped chalcogenide glasses have been investigated The thesis contains five chapters: Chapter 1 : This chapter is an introduction to the fundamental aspects of amorphous semiconductors with a particular reference to chalcogenide glasses. The advantages and applications of chalcogenide glasses are also described. Chapter 2 : The methods of preparation and characterization of the glasses investigated are described in this chapter. Also, the details of the experiments undertaken, namely temperature modulated Alternating Differential Scanning Calorimetry (ADSC), electrical switching analysis, Photo-thermal Deflection Spectroscopy (PDS), etc, are outlined. Chapter 3 : In this chapter, the thermal behavior and electrical switching of silver doped Ge-Se and As-Se chalcogenide glasses are described. Bulk, melt-quenched Se-rich Ge 0. 15 Se 0. 85 -xAgx glasses {{have been found to be}} microscopically phase separated and composed of Ag 2 Se clusters and GeSe 2 -Se network. When the silver concentration exceeds 10 atom %, the Ag 2 Se clusters embedded in the GeSe 2 -Se network percolate. The signature of this percolation threshold is clearly observed as the sudden appearance of two exothermic crystallization peaks in ADSC runs. Density, molar volume and micro hardness studies also strongly support the view of a percolation transition. The super-ionic conduction observed earlier in these glasses at higher silver proportions, is likely to be connected with the silver phase percolation. It has been found that Ge 0. 15 Se 0. 85 -xAgx glasses of lower silver concentration (x = 0. 07 and 0. 08) do not exhibit electrical switching at voltages up to 1100 V. A negative resistance behavior and threshold type electrical switching is seen in Ge 0. 15 Se 0. 85 -xAgx samples with x 0. 09. Also, fluctuations are observed in the I-V characteristics of these samples, which have been attributed to the difference in thermal conductivities between the Ag 2 Se inclusions and the Ge-Se base glass. A sharp drop has been observed in the switching voltage with Ag concentration which is due to the more metallic nature of silver and the presence of Ag+ ions. Further, the saturation in the decrease of VT around x = 0. 10, is related to silver phase percolation in these glasses. Bulk As 20 Se 80 -xAgx glasses (0 x 15) have been found to exhibit two endothermic glass transitions and two exothermic crystallization reactions on heating. Based on which it is suggested that As 20 Se 80 -xAgx glasses are also microscopically phase separated, containing Ag 2 Se phases embedded in an As-Se backbone. The occurrence of microscopic phase separation in As 20 Se 80 -xAgx glasses is also confirmed by SEM studies. With increasing silver concentration, the Ag 2 Se phase percolates in the As-Se matrix, with a well-defined percolation threshold at x = 8. This silver phase percolation is exemplified by sudden jumps in the composition dependence of the second crystallization peak and non-reversible heat-flow, Hnr obtained at the second glass transition reaction of As 20 Se 80 -xAgx glasses. The super-ionic conduction observed earlier in these glasses at higher silver proportions, is likely to be associated with the observed silver phase percolation. Like Ge 0. 15 Se 0. 85 -xAgx glasses, As 20 Se 80 -xAgx glasses also exhibit threshold type electrical switching with fluctuations in the I-V characteristics; these fluctuations have been attributed to the difference in thermal conductivities between the Ag 2 Se inclusions and the As-Se base glass. A sharp drop has been observed in the switching voltage with Ag concentration which is due to the more metallic nature of silver and the presence of Ag+ ions. Further, the saturation in the decrease of VT around x = 8, is found to be related to silver phase percolation in these glasses, which has been proposed on the basis of ADSC experiments. Chapter 4 : The chapter 4 deals with thermal studies, electrical switching investigations and Photo-thermal Deflection Spectroscopic (PDS) measurements on certain Ge-Te-I and As-Te-I chalcohalide glasses. It has been found that the compositional variation of the glass transition temperature of Ge 22 Te 78 -xIx glasses, obtained by Alternating Differential Scanning Calorimetry (ADSC), exhibits a broad hump around 5 atom % of iodine. Further, a sharp minimum is seen in the composition dependence of non-reversing enthalpy (Hnr) of Ge 22 Te 78 -xIx glasses at x = 5, which is suggestive of a thermally reversing window at this composition. Electrical switching studies on Ge 22 Te 78 -xIx glasses indicate that these glasses exhibit memory type electrical switching. At lower iodine concentrations, a decrease is seen in switching voltages with an increase in iodine content (in comparison with the base Ge 22 Te 78 glass), which is due to the decrease in network connectivity. The increase seen in switching voltages of Ge 22 Te 78 -xIx glasses at higher iodine contents, suggests that the influence of the metallicity is stronger at higher iodine proportions. It is also interesting to note that the composition dependence of the threshold voltages shows a slope change at x = 5, the inverse rigidity percolation threshold of the Ge 22 Te 78 -xIx system.. Further, it is found that the thermal diffusivities (D) of Ge 22 Te 78 -xIx glasses decrease with the increase in iodine content, which has been understood on the basis of fragmentation of the Ge-Te network with the addition of iodine. Also, a cusp is seen in the composition dependence of thermal diffusivity at the composition x = 5 (average coordination number, r = 2. 39), which has been identified to be the inverse rigidity percolation threshold of the system at which the network connectivity is lost. ADSC studies on As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx chalcohalide glasses (3 x 10) reveal that there is not much variation in the glass transition temperature of As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx glasses, even though there is a wide variation in r. Based on this observation we suggest that the variation in glass transition temperature of network glasses is dictated by the variation in average bond energy rather than the average coordination number. Further, the non-reversing enthalpy Hnr of As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx glasses is found to exhibit a sharp minimum at the composition x = 6. A broad hump is also seen in glass transition and crystallization temperatures in the composition range 5 x 7. These results indicate a narrow thermally reversing window in As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx glasses around the composition x = 6. As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx glasses have been found to exhibit a memory to threshold type change in switching behavior with iodine content (x 6), which has been understood on the basis of the sharp increase in thermal diffusivity above x = 6. It is also observed that the switching voltages do not change appreciably with composition/average coordination number. Though no pronounced signature of a stiffness transition is seen in the variation with composition of VT, fluctuations are seen in the switching voltages around x = 6, the composition corresponding to the sharp thermally revering window. PDS studies indicate that the thermal diffusivities () of As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx chalcohalide exhibit a sharp minimum at the composition x = 6. This result reasserts the presence of a sharp thermally reversing window in As <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 55 -xIx glasses around the composition x = 6.

40|$|Echo-planar imaging (EPI) is a {{standard}} procedure in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) for measuring changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with neuronal activity. The images obtained from fMRI with EPI, however, exhibit signal dropouts and geometric distortions. Parallel imaging (PI), due to its short readout, accelerates image acquisition and might reduce dephasing in phase-encoding direction. The concomitant loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) might be compensated through single-shot multi-echo EPI (mEPI). We systematically compared the temporal SNR and BOLD sensitivity of single echoes (<b>TE</b> = 15, <b>45,</b> and 75 ms) and contrast-optimized mEPI with and without PI and mEPI-based denoising. Audio-visual stimulation under natural viewing conditions activated distributed neural networks. Heterogeneous SNR, noise gain, and sensitivity maps emerged. In single echoes, SNR and BOLD sensitivity followed the predicted dependency on echo time (TE) and were reduced under PI. However, the combination of echoes with mEPI recovered the quality parameters and increased BOLD signal changes at circumscribed fronto-polar and deep brain structures. We suggest applying PI only in combination with mEPI to reduce imaging artifacts and conserve BOLD sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{fabrication}} {{of a high}} temperature measurement setup to measure Figure of merit (ZT). This setup facilitates the simultaneous measurement of Seebeck coefficient (α), thermal conductivity (κ), and electrical resistivity (ρ) required to calculate ZT. Measurement of temperature, as well as voltages using same thermocouples, simplified {{the design of the}} setup by minimizing sensors and wires. Limited components used in the sample holder further simplify the design and make it small in size and lightweight. The dedicated thin heater is made, which minimizes the heat loss. Further, low heat loss is achieved by optimizing the insulator dimension. To measure power delivered to the heater, 4 -wire technique is used. Low cost and commonly available materials used in the fabrication of various components make it more accessible to the user as any parts can be easily replaced in case of any damage occurs. A dedicated program is built in the Python programming language to automate the whole measurement process. p-type Bi 0. 36 Sb 1. <b>45</b> <b>Te</b> 3 sample is used to calibrate this measurement setup. The data collected are found to be in good agreement with the reported data. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|Background: Transposable Elements (<b>TEs)</b> {{comprise}} nearly <b>45</b> % of {{the entire}} genome and are part of sophisticated regulatory network systems that control developmental processes in normal and pathological conditions. The retroviral/ retrotransposon gene machinery consists mainly of Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs- 1) and Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) that code for their own endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT). Interestingly, RT is typically expressed at high levels in cancer cells. Recent studies report that RT inhibition by non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) induces growth arrest and cell differentiation in vitro and antagonizes growth of human tumors in animal model. In the present study we analyze the anticancer activity of Abacavir (ABC), a nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor (NRTI), on PC 3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines. Principal Findings: ABC significantly reduces cell growth, migration and invasion processes, considerably slows S phase progression, induces senescence and cell death in prostate cancer cells. Consistent with these observations, microarray analysis on PC 3 cells shows that ABC induces specific and dose-dependent changes in gene expression, involving multiple cellular pathways. Notably, by quantitative Real-Time PCR we found that LINE- 1 ORF 1 and ORF 2 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated by ABC treatment. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the potential of ABC as anticancer agent able to induce antiproliferative activity an...|$|R
40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (<b>TEs)</b> represent ∼ <b>45</b> % of {{the human}} genome and 50 – 90 % of some grass genomes. While most elements contain inactivating mutations, others are reversibly inactivated (silenced) by epigenetic mechanisms, including cytosine methylation. Previous studies have shown that retrotransposons can influence the expression of adjacent host genes. In this study, the methylation patterns of TEs and their flanking sequences in different tissues were undertaken using a novel technique called transposon methylation display (TMD). TMD was successfully applied on a highly copied (∼ 1000 copies), newly amplified LTR retrotransposon family in rice called Dasheng. We determined that the methylation status of a subset of LTRs varies in leaves vs. roots. In addition, we determined that tissue-specific LTR methylation correlated with tissue-specific expression of the flanking rice gene. Genes showing tissue-specific expression were in opposite orientation relative to the LTR. Antisense transcripts were detected in the tissue where the sense transcripts from that gene were not detected. Comparative analysis of Dasheng LTR methylation in the two subspecies, japonica vs. indica revealed LTR-mediated differences in subspecies gene expression. Subspecies-specific expression was due either to polymorphic Dasheng insertion sites between the two subspecies or to subspecies-specific methylation of LTRs at the same locus accounted for observed differences in the expression of adjacent genes...|$|R
40|$|Blastomere {{fate and}} {{embryonic}} genome activation (EGA) during human embryonic development are unsolved areas of high scientific and clinical interest. Forty-nine blastomeres from 5 - to 8 -cell human embryos {{have been investigated}} following an efficient single-cell cDNA amplification protocol to provide a template for high-density microarray analysis. The previously described markers, characteristic of Inner Cell Mass (ICM) (n = 120), stemness (n = 190) and Trophectoderm (<b>TE)</b> (n = <b>45),</b> were analyzed, and a housekeeping pattern of 46 genes was established. All the human blastomeres from the 5 - to 8 -cell stage embryo displayed a common gene expression pattern corresponding to ICM markers (e. g., DDX 3, FOXD 3, LEFTY 1, MYC, NANOG, POU 5 F 1), stemness (e. g., POU 5 F 1, DNMT 3 B, GABRB 3, SOX 2, ZFP 42, TERT), and TE markers (e. g., GATA 6, EOMES, CDX 2, LHCGR). The EGA profile was also investigated between the 5 - 6 - and 8 -cell stage embryos, and compared to the blastocyst stage. Known genes (n = 92) such as depleted maternal transcripts (e. g., CCNA 1, CCNB 1, DPPA 2) and embryo-specific activation (e. g., POU 5 F 1, CDH 1, DPPA 4), as well as novel genes, were confirmed. In summary, the global single-cell cDNA amplification microarray analysis of the 5 - to 8 -cell stage human embryos reveals that blastomere fate is not committed to ICM or TE. Finally, new EGA features in human embryogenesis are presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Virtual reality (VR) {{systems have}} been proven to {{increase}} motor performance in stroke and elderly patients. However, the effects have not been established in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effects of VR-based training in improving muscle strength, sensory integration ability, and walking abilities in patients with PD through a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Thirty-six individuals who have been diagnosed with PD were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n =  12 for each group). Participants performed VR-based Wii Fit exercise (VRWii group) or traditional exercise (<b>TE</b> group) for <b>45</b> minutes, followed by treadmill training for another 15 minutes for 12 sessions in 6 weeks. Participants in the control group did not undergo the structured exercise program, but received fall-prevention education instead. The study outcomes included lower extremity muscle strength, sensory integration ability, walking velocity, stride length, and functional gait assessment. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, after training, and at 1 month follow-up. Results: Both the VRWii and TE groups showed more improvement in level walking velocity, stride length, functional gait assessment, muscle strength, and vestibular system integration compared with the control group after training and at 1 month follow-up. The VRWii training, but not the TE training, resulted in greater improvement in visual system integration than the control. Conclusion: VRWii training is as beneficial as TE in improving walking abilities, sensory integration ability, and muscle strength in patients with PD, and such improvements persisted for at least for 1 month. VRWii training is thus suggested to be implemented in patients with PD...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectivesWe {{conducted}} preliminary {{research to}} validate the insertion depth ranges of the five phase points by using ultrasonography. Design and settingThe insertion depth ranges of the five phase points were investigated by reviewing acupuncture and moxibustion literature. The following lengths were measured in centimetres in order to substitute B-cun values with centimetre values: {{the distance from the}} cubital crease to the palmar crease, from the inferior border of the medial tibia condyle to the medial malleolus, and from the popliteal crease to the prominence of the lateral malleolus. The five phase points were represented by pen marks on the skin, per the World Health Organization acupuncture point specifications. The anatomical structures of the five phase points within the insertion depth ranges were observed using colour Doppler ultrasound. ResultsThe five phase points for which the insertion depth ranges needed to be modified were LU 11, HT 9, PC 9, LI 1, LI 2, SI 1, SI 2, <b>TE</b> 1, ST <b>45,</b> BL 66, GB 44, SP 1, SP 2, LR 1, and BL 67. The five phase points that required careful insertion of acupuncture needles were LU 8, LU 9, LU 10, LI 5, ST 36, ST 41, SP 3, HT 4, HT 7, HT 8, SI 3, SI 8, BL 40, KI 2, KI 3, KI 10, KI 27, GB 34, GB 38, LR 3, and LR 4. ConclusionThis preliminary study provided evidence on the insertion depths in acupuncture treatment. To generate more concrete evidence regarding insertion depths, further research should be conducted in a participant group with more diverse body mass index (BMI) values by using acupoint-specific ultrasonography transducers that can measure the acupoints properly...|$|R

40|$|Stems are the {{important}} residues of Trapa quadrispinosa Roxb., which are abundant in phenolic compounds. Ultrasonic-assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE) is confirmed as a novel extraction technology with main advantages of enhancing extraction yield and physiological {{activities of the}} extracts from various plants. In this study, UAEE was applied to obtain the highest yield of phenolic content, strongest antioxidant, and antitumor activities and to optimize the extraction conditions using response surface methodology (RSM). The extracts from the stems of T. quadrispinosa were characterized by determination of their antioxidant activities through 2, 2 -azinobis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline) - 6 -sulfonic acid (ABTS), 1, 1 -Diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazxyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAC) methods and of their antitumor activity by MTT method. The selected key independent variables were cellulase concentration (X 1 : 1. 5 %– 2. 5 %), extraction time (X 2 : 20 – 30 min) and extraction temperature (X 3 : 40 – 60 °C). The optimal extraction conditions for total phenolic content (TPC) value of the extracts were determined as 1. 74 % cellulase concentration, 25. 5 min ultrasonic extraction time and 49. 0 °C ultrasonic temperature. Under these conditions, the highest TPC value of 53. 6 ± 2. 2 mg Gallic acid equivalent (GAE) /g dry weight (DW) was obtained, which agreed well with the predicted value (52. 596 mg GAE/g·DW. Furthermore, the extracts obtained from UAEE presented highest antioxidant activities through ABTS, DPPH, TAC and FRAC methods were of 1. 54 ± 0. 09 mmol Trolox equivalent (<b>TE)</b> /g·DW; 1. <b>45</b> ± 0. 07 mmol·TE/g·DW; 45. 2 ± 2. 2 mg·GAE/g·DW; 50. 4 ± 2. 6 μmol FeSO 4 equivalent/g·DW and lowest IC 50 values of 160. 4 ± 11. 6 μg/mL, 126. 1 ± 10. 8 μg/mL, and 178. 3 ± 13. 1 μg/mL against Hela, HepG- 2 and U 251 tumor cells, respectively.
