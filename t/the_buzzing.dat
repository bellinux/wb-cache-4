5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
25|$|During the Renaissance, the {{hurdy-gurdy}} was a {{very popular}} instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that buzzing bridges first appeared in illustrations. <b>The</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge (commonly called the dog) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board. When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. <b>The</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge {{is thought to have}} been borrowed from the tromba marina (monochord), a bowed string instrument.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> {{completely}} remade its roster {{again in}} 2007. For {{the second straight}} year, the team elected to pass on making a selection in the marquee player draft. Julie Ditty {{was traded to the}} Boston Lobsters. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> selected 2005 WTT Rookie of the Year Rik de Voest {{in the first round of}} the roster draft and Ashley Fisher in the second round. In the third round, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> traded down in exchange for cash consideration from the Newport Beach Breakers. The Breakers used <b>the</b> <b>Buzz's</b> number 2 pick to select Lauren Albanese while <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> used <b>the</b> Breakers' number 10 choice to take Gabriela Navrátilová. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> drafted Gréta Arn in the fourth round. After four straight losing seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> finally turned its fortunes finishing with 8 wins and 6 losses tied for first place with the Philadelphia Freedoms in the highly competitive Eastern Conference. Only 2 match wins separated first place from last place in <b>the</b> conference. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> won a standings tiebreaker over the Freedoms making it the top seed in the conference.|$|R
5000|$|After their First Death, Immortals {{can feel}} <b>the</b> <b>Buzz.</b> Panzer defines <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> as [...] "the concept of Immortals {{being able to}} sense each other's {{presence}} from a reasonable distance. We called it <b>the</b> <b>Buzz.</b> That word was never used, but that's how it was featured in the scripts." [...] Indeed, the script of Highlander: The Series pilot episode [...] "The Gathering" [...] describes it as, [...] "We hear something we will describe as <b>the</b> Highlander <b>Buzz.</b> Perhaps it {{is accompanied by a}} moving camera, an odd angle... something. Whatever it is, Duncan MacLeod suddenly senses it, strongly." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> is something felt, not heard. In the above described scene, Duncan says that he feels something, although Tessa does not hear anything. Pre-Immortals do not feel <b>the</b> <b>Buzz,</b> but full-grown Immortals can sense and identify pre-Immortals in this way (though <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> is faint and easy to miss). Pre-Immortals start triggering <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> in full-grown Immortals when they are dying for the first time; a mortally wounded Alfred Cahill caused Duncan MacLeod a Buzz even before he was actually dead. Immortals who are not yet aware of the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> often experience it as a headache, like Colin MacLeod, or migraine. Temporarily dead Immortals do not trigger a Buzz.|$|R
500|$|The {{winds of}} the tornado vortex and of {{constituent}} turbulent eddies, {{as well as}} airflow interaction with the surface and debris, contribute to the sounds. Funnel clouds also produce sounds. Funnel clouds and small tornadoes are reported as whistling, whining, humming, or <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> of innumerable bees or electricity, or more or less harmonic, whereas many tornadoes are reported as a continuous, deep rumbling, or an irregular sound of [...] "noise".|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees do not {{exhibit the}} [...] "bee dances" [...] used by honeybees to tell other workers the {{locations}} of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging. Another stimulant to foraging activity {{is the level of}} food reserves in the colony. Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots, and when little is left or when high quality food is added, {{they are more likely to}} go out to forage.|$|E
500|$|The soundtracks of Eega and Naan Ee, each {{consisting}} of five songsone {{of which is}} a remixed version of the film's title song—were composed by M. M. Keeravani. Keeravani said because the film's theme of revenge and the protagonist (a housefly) are universal concepts, his [...] "only challenge" [...] was ensuring the music did not have a [...] "distinct ethnic or regional flavour" [...] and [...] "appeal". He incorporated <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> sound made by flies into the score and exaggerated or reduced it according to a scene's emotional nature. Rajamouli approached Madhan Karky to write the lyrics for Naan Ee soundtrack after the release of Enthiran (2010), explaining the importance of each song in the film's narrative. As well as providing detailed profiles of the characters, Rajamouli enacted a few scenes, which helped Karky write the lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|In {{some types}} of hurdy-gurdy, notably the French vielle à roue ('fiddle with a wheel') and the Hungarian tekerőlant (tekerő for short), makers have added a buzzing bridge—called a chien (French for dog) or recsegő (Hungarian for [...] "buzzer")—on one drone string. Modern makers have {{increased}} the number of buzzing bridges on French-style instruments to as many as four. This mechanism consists of a loose bridge under a drone string. The tail of <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot (or held by a peg in Hungarian instruments) that holds <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge in place (and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments).|$|E
2500|$|On French-style instruments, the {{sensitivity}} of <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a tirant in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the trompette. The tirant adjusts the lateral pressure on the trompette and thereby sets {{the sensitivity}} of <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge to changes in wheel velocity. When hard to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said [...] "sec" [...] (dry), [...] "chien sec" [...] or [...] "coup sec". When easy to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said [...] "gras" [...] (fat), [...] "chien gras", or [...] "coup gras".|$|E

2500|$|On the Hungarian tekerő {{the same}} control is {{achieved}} by using a wedge called the recsegőék (control wedge, or literally [...] "buzzer wedge") that pushes the drone string downward. In traditional tekerő playing, <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on French instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Background (or BG) {{sound effects}} are sounds {{that do not}} {{explicitly}} synchronize with the picture, but indicate setting to the audience, such as forest sounds, <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> of fluorescent lights, and car interiors.

These background noises are also called ambience or atmos ("atmosphere").|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} {{traditional}} versions, various sizes of natural gourds are attached below {{the keys to}} act as resonators; in more sophisticated versions carved wooden resonators are substituted, allowing for more precise tuning of pitch. [...] In Central America and Mexico, a hole is often carved {{into the bottom of}} each resonator and then covered with a delicate membrane taken from the intestine of a pig to add a characteristic [...] "buzzing" [...] or [...] "rattling" [...] sound known as charleo. In more contemporary-style marimbas, wood is replaced by PVC tubing. The holes in the bottoms of the tubes are covered with a thin layer of paper to produce <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> noise.|$|E

2500|$|In a cat's whisker {{detector}} {{only certain}} {{sites on the}} crystal surface functioned as rectifying junctions, and the device was very sensitive to {{the pressure of the}} crystal-wire contact, which could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. Therefore, a usable contact point had to be found by trial and error before each use. The operator dragged the wire across the crystal surface until a radio station or [...] "static" [...] sounds were heard in the earphones. [...] Alternatively, some radios (circuit, right) used a battery-powered buzzer attached to the input circuit to adjust the detector. The spark at the buzzer's electrical contacts served as a weak source of static, so when the detector began working, <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> could be heard in the earphones. [...] The buzzer was then turned off, and the radio tuned to the desired station.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>buzzing</b> {{sound of}} the V-1's pulse jet engine was likened by some to [...] "a motor cycle in bad running order". As it reached its target and dived, the {{sound of the}} {{propulsion}} unit spluttering and cutting out, followed by an eerie hush before impact, was quite terrifying, though the silence was also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally-intended power dive). [...] At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon and casualties were high. By late August {{a million and a half}} people had left London and the rate of work production was affected. By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective countermeasures against the V-1 were taken and people started returning to London.|$|E
2500|$|According to DeRogatis, {{the roots}} of stoner rock can be heard on Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, Hawkwind's 25 Years On 1973–1977 box set, the {{aforementioned}} Blue Cheer album, Deep Purple's Machine Head and Blue Öyster Cult's Workshop of the Telescopes. Black Sabbath's Master of Reality is often cited as the first album of the genre, and Martin Popoff states: [...] "When 'Sweet Leaf' kicks in, one witnesses simultaneously the invention of stoner rock". Allmusic summarizes this unique fusion as follows: [...] "Stoner metal bands updated the long, mind-bending jams and ultra-heavy riffs of bands like Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Blue Öyster Cult, and Hawkwind by filtering their psychedelia-tinged metal and acid rock through <b>the</b> <b>buzzing</b> sound of early Sub Pop–style grunge." [...] However, Kyuss members Josh Homme and John Garcia have shrugged off the heavy metal influence, and instead cite punk rock and hardcore punk, particularly the sludgy hardcore of Black Flag's album My War as influences.|$|E
50|$|For {{the third}} {{straight}} season, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> passed on making a selection in the Marquee Player Draft. In the Roster Player Draft, the defending Eastern Conference champions left 2007 WTT Championship Most Valuable Player Rik de Voest unprotected {{in the first round}} and instead chose Yaroslava Shvedova. Nathan Healey was taken in the second round, leaving Ashley Fisher unprotected. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> protected Gabriela Navrátilová in the third round, which gave the team two full-time female players and forced it to leave Gréta Arn unprotected. Vladimir Obradović was <b>the</b> <b>Buzz's</b> final selection in the draft. The team did not select any roster-exempt players. <b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> named Jay Udwadia as its new head coach.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Buzz</b> {{selected}} {{former world}} number 1 Martina Hingis in the 2010 marquee player draft, and Hingis committed to playing full-time. Alex Domijan {{was the only}} player to return from the 2009 squad. Although he wasn't protected by <b>the</b> <b>Buzz,</b> <b>the</b> team chose him {{in the third round}} of the roster draft. In the first two rounds, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> selected Scoville Jenkins and Sarah Borwell. With Hingis committed to playing full-time, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> didn't need its fourth round choice in the roster draft and sold the pick to the Sacramento Capitals for cash consideration. Jay Udwadia, who coached <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> to its only WTT championship in 2008, returned as the team's coach after a one-year absence. While the team continued to call SEFCU Arena its home, the July 9 home match against the Washington Kastles was played at the larger Glens Falls Civic Center in Glens Falls, New York, since it was expected to feature Hingis against Serena Williams in the women's singles set. Williams, who had just won her fourth Wimbledon ladies' singles title a few days before, did not play in the match in Glens Falls. With <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> struggling with 2 wins and 9 losses, Yvette Hyndman started getting some playing time late in the season. Despite the full-time presence of Hingis, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> suffered <b>the</b> worst season in team history finishing with 2 wins and 12 losses, the worst record in WTT in 2010.|$|R
25|$|As {{the number}} 2 overall {{seed in the}} WTT playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> was matched against the number 3 seeded Sportimes.

Nathan Healey and Yaroslava Shvedova opened the match with a 5–3 set win against John McEnroe and Hana Šromová in mixed doubles. Shvedova followed with a 5–2 women's singles win over Ashley Harkleroad. Healy took care of Jesse Witten, 5–2, in men's singles. Gabriela Navrátilová and Shvedova needed a tiebreaker to beat Harkleroad and Šromová, 5–4, and give <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> a 20–11 lead heading to the final set. McEnroe and Witten won a tiebreaker over Patrick Briaud and Healy in the men's doubles to force overtime with <b>the</b> <b>Buzz</b> leading 24–16.
