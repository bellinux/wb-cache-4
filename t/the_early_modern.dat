5|$|In later medieval prayers, Elves {{appear as}} a threatening, even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against noctural attacks by Alpe. Correspondingly, in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>modern</b> period, elves are {{described}} in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.|$|E

In 1632, Galileo represented Aristotelianism in his Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo by the strawman Simplicio ("Simpleton"). That same year, William Harvey proved Aristotle wrong by demonstrating that blood circulates.|$|E

5|$|The major {{development}} of weapons in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>modern</b> and modern periods occurred with firearms, which became progressively more efficient.

Towards the onset of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>modern</b> period, in 1474, the Vatican librarian Bartolomeo Platina wrote De honesta voluptate et valetudine ("On honourable pleasure and health") and the physician Iodocus Willich edited Apicius in Zurich in 1563.|$|E

5|$|While the {{incidence}} of use dropped, towards the latter end of the Middle Ages the incendiary devices became more sophisticated, and the principle of wielding fire with sword remained present throughout <b>the</b> <b>Early</b> <b>Modern</b> and Modern periods; improving technology merely allowed the process to become more efficient.|$|E
5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>modern</b> period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>modern</b> period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>modern</b> era.|$|E

5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous.

Blister steel (made as above) was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast (usually) into ingots.|$|E
