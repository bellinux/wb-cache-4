40|$|At present, {{study on}} dynamic tensile {{properties}} and atomic chain fabrication of single nanowire, for understanding its dynamic tensile properties and unique physical properties of atomic chain to fabricate atom scale devices, {{is one of}} frontier research issues in nanoscale science. However, how to assemble single nanowire on a <b>tensible</b> microstructure becomes {{one of the most}} difficult problems, which severely restricts the development of this research field. In this paper, after the ultrahigh <b>tensible</b> microelectrode chip is fabricated by MEMS technology, hexamethyldisilazane is utilized to improve hydrophobicity of the chip, and then a microdroplet dielectrophoresis experimental platform and technology is developed to assemble single nanowire on the sensible microelectrode. Experimental results show that accurate and efficient assembly of single Cu nanowire is realized, which contribute greatly to the further research of dynamic tensile properties and atomic chain fabrication. And for guiding the assembly experiments, finite element technology is also utilized to analyze the local microelectro field around the microelectrodes during dieletrophoresis experiments.

This project addresses {{building up a}} simple RISC processor, that supports an ex- <b>tensible</b> instructions set thanks to its reconfigurable functional unit. The originality comes from that the students {{make use of the}} Biniou framework, that has been developed in the Lab-STICC. The Biniou ap- proach covers tasks ranging from describing the RFU, synthesizing it as VHDL code, and implementing applications over it...|$|E

The springs include an active spring section (3), whose length is adjustable. The spring section extends between a force application point (6) and a bearing section (8) of the springs. The bearing section is guided in a spring bearing (4). The spring bearing is displaceably arranged along the springs for varying {{a position of}} the springs relative to the force application point.

40|$|Abstract. Plane strain {{compression}} {{were carried}} out for as-cast and pre-strained AZ 31 alloy specimens at 210 ～ 330 ˚C. The influence of initial grain on strengthening effect was analyzed by means of metallographic examination and mechanical testing. The results indicate the recrystallized grain of Mg alloy is sensitive to initial grain. With the deformation temperature increasing, the ultimate <b>tensible</b> strength decreases for as-cast and pre-strained alloy. With the deformation degree increasing, the tensile strength presents an increasing trend for as-cast alloy, but the tensile strength decreases on the whole for pre-strained alloy. The tensile strength increments of ～ 50 % can be achieved under appropriate processing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a tool for {{automatic}} website checking. We created an ex- <b>tensible</b> system that checks the validity of links as well as HTML and CSS syntax. For that, we integrated existing tools and libraries into one application using plu- gins. Our tool looks for links in HTML and sitemaps. Also, robots. txt including crawl-delay implementation and sitemap discovery is supported. The course of inspection can be affected by configuration rules. Plugin categorization allows for customization of inspection. Not only we verify the validity of standard hypertext links but also links through other HTML tags (images, frames, cascading styles, scripts). In addition, canonical addresses and redirection, duplicates in content or usage of non-semantic tags or attributes are detected. The developed application is extensible for other types of checks. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{whole set}} of the {{stiffnesses}} of materials that possess any class of symmetry, and then the higher symmetry coordinate system can be determined from wave speed measurements of obliquely incident ultrasonic bulk waves [1 – 2]. An immersion ultrasonic tank associated with a tensile machine allows one to measure the load-induced changes of the stiffness tensor [3]. The damage {{can be defined as}} the variation of the elasticity tensor [4]. No preliminary knowledge of the microstructure is required to describe the damage process. Concerning former works on off-axis loading [5], the choice of a tetragonal material submitted to a <b>tensible</b> solicitation at 45 ° from fiber directions, was imposed by the limiting hypothesis required by classical ultrasonic techniques that the material keeps its orthorhombic symmetry in a a priori known coordinate system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the state of}} the art of building information systems and evaluates their architecture in the context of emerging technologies and applications for deep analysis of the built environment. We observe that modern building information systems are difficult to extend, do not provide general services for application development, do not scale, and are difficult to set up and manage. We assert that a new architecture must be designed with four system properties - extensibility, generalizability, scalability, ease of management - in order to address these shortcomings. Our system, StreamFS, embodies these system properties through a filesystem abstraction and a set of data services. Data services are made available to applications through an overloaded pipe abstraction. This allows for dataflow specification of processing streams to clean and analyze the streaming sensor data. We deploy StreamFS in seven different buildings and compose several applications on top of it. One of the driving applications is a phone application called the Mobile Energy Lens. The Energy Lens provides occupants with mechanisms for collecting building information in a unified platform and provides a way to view aggregate energy consumption data associated with the spatial deployment configuration of plug-load devices. We present a three-layer architecture, where one of the main layers is implemented entirely with the data management and processing services offered by StreamFS. We introduce the notion of verification of physical relationships through empiricial data. We partition the verification problem into three sub problems: 1) functional verification, 2) spatial verification, and 3) categorical verification. We show how empirical mode decompo- sition, correlation, and standard machine learning techniques can give us information about how the sensors are related to each other, statistically and physically. We demonstate an ex- <b>tensible,</b> generalizable, scalable, and easy-to-manage system for supporting the "appification" of the built environment...|$|E
40|$|In Part I of the {{well-known}} Book of Antelopes {{there is a}} figure (Plate XIV, fig. 2), under the name Cephalophus sylvicultrix representing an animal of a color quite different from all the known specimens of C. silvicultor and therefore too differing from the animal figured l. c. plate XIII. The authors of the Book of Antelopes, p. 130, relate: »our »second figure (Plate XIV, fig. 2), which was prepared by »Mr. Smit under Sir Victor Brooke’s directions, probably »represents a young male of this species; {{but we do not}} »know for certain from what specimen it was taken. ” That this figure represents a young animal, as the authors of the Book of Antelopes suggested, is not very likely, as the figure agrees in size with that of the full-grown very old specimen on plate XIII, and as the horns are of the same size apparently as those of plate XIII; we may therefore be sure that this aberrant form has been drawn after an adult individual; nothing is to be seen in that drawing to base upon the suggestion about its sex; the locality too is unknown. There is now in our Museum an Antelope shot by Mr. Cox in North-Western Rhodesia; it is an adult male, an exceedingly splendid animal, so exactly agreeing with the figure 2, Plate XIV, of the Book of Antelopes, that a better portrait cannot be desired! Compared side by side with our Chephalophus silvicultor-specimens, every one must be struck by the distinctness of the animals. Now all specimens of C. silvicultor are trom the West-Coast of Africa and it therefore may be no wonder to meet with a differently colored species in a locality as Rhodesia, so far from the West-Coast of Africa. In the P. Z. S. L. 1902, Vol. I, p. 2, there is however a communication by Mr. Oldfield Thomas, relating an Antelope from North-Eastern Rhodesia; he said: »that there are no differences of importance per»ceptible between the Rhodesian specimen and examples »from West-Africa. ” »No differences of importance,” this means that there are some differences, meanwhile »importance” is a very <b>tensible</b> word! The authors of the Book of Antelopes did not think {{the differences between the two}} above mentioned figures of enough importance to make a distinct species of the animal of unknown origin — but of a so different color — as that figured on Plate XIV, fig. 2 ! I should be inclined to suggest, that the Rhodesiaspecimen in the British Museum perhaps agrees with the latter figure and therefore belongs to the same species as our Rhodesia-specimen! And that this perhaps is the case with a frontlet and a piece of skin also received from Mr. Baragwanath of Bulawayo, obtained in the same district and now in the British Museum! This may be a correct hypothesis or not, a fact is that our Rhodesia-specimen is quite distinct from the West-African C. silvicltor, so that I propose to regard it as the type of a new species: Cephalophus Coxi, after its discoverer Mr. Cox...|$|E
