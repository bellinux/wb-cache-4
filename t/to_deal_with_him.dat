Narses escaped from Leontius, the eunuch appointed by Phocas <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> but when Narses attempted to return to Constantinople to discuss peace terms, Phocas ordered him seized and burned alive. The death of Narses along with the failure to stop the Persians damaged the prestige of Phocas' military regime.|$|E

5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, {{only to find the}} target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul. Very shortly thereafter, the Turkish artillery fired on Sing's position—he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham's Post alive.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC {{established}} two forts to the north-west of Algoa in 1900, then a boma at Feira in 1902, bringing Mashukulumbwe under Company control. Harrison Clark {{said that}} his concessions gave him authority over the area and demanded that the Company pay him for them. The BSAC said Clark's documents were illegal and refused <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> It offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford {{and a man who}} knew Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel NO Earl Spurr, say that he was given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, AM Bentley, writes that the Company promised grants of land and the right to reserve some mining claims. Clark reluctantly accepted the compensation when he realised that to challenge the BSAC he would have to travel a great distance, possibly to England, and invest heavily in a court case he would probably lose.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1861, Davis {{appointed}} General P. G. T. Beauregard {{to command}} all Confederate {{troops in the}} vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geo-political posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union crew had but half a dozen officers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The US President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. Jefferson Davis, for Lincoln, was the leader of an insurrection and so without legal standing in US affairs. <b>To</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. Holding to the belief that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fortress. He informed Gov. Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from 10 miles at sea.|$|E

25|$|Bismarck {{was sixteen}} {{years older than}} Friedrich; before the latter became terminally ill, Bismarck did not expect he would live to see Wilhelm ascend to the throne and thus had no {{strategy}} <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Conflicts between Wilhelm and his chancellor soon poisoned their relationship. Their final split occurred after Bismarck tried to implement far-reaching anti-socialist laws in early 1890. The Kartell majority in the Reichstag, including the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, was willing to make most of the laws permanent. However, it was split about the law granting the police the power to expel socialist agitators from their homes, a power {{that had been used}} excessively at times against political opponents. The National Liberals refused to make this law permanent, while the Conservatives supported only the entirety of the bill, threatening to and eventually vetoing the entire bill in session because Bismarck would not agree to a modified bill.|$|E

25|$|The {{answer to}} the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make informed decisions. The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{a passing}} mention by another (minor) author, the Annales by the Roman {{historian}} Tacitus (written ca. 98 AD) {{is the sole}} surviving ancient source on the Tacfarinas War. Tacitus gives a relatively detailed account, but its exclusivity {{makes it difficult to}} assess its accuracy and the war's significance. Tacitus was fascinated by the psychology of the emperor Tiberius, whom he regarded as the quintessential flawed tyrant, and the way that the long-drawn out insurgency in Africa with its many crises exposed his weaknesses. For example, the emperor's explosion of fury when he received envoys from Tacfarinas demanding concessions in return for peace. This was not only due to Tiberius' exasperation with the insurgency. Adding insult to injury, Tacfarinas was apparently a commoner by birth, an affront to the status-conscious Romans. To Tiberius, a scion of the illustrious Claudii patrician clan and ruler of a vast empire, it seemed intolerable that such a person should be seeking <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on an equal basis, like a foreign king. Tacitus relates with relish Tiberius' feelings of personal humiliation.|$|E
25|$|Fred {{comes down}} with an illness and is cured by Mr. Lydgate, the newest doctor in Middlemarch. Rosamond, who is well-educated and seeks {{to make a good}} match, decides to marry Lydgate and uses Fred's {{sickness}} as an opportunity to get close to the doctor. Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left if he takes it easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one.

25|$|The Nyasaland {{government}} had imprisoned Banda, not realising {{that he was}} the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda, unlike other Congress leaders, was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Had Devlin found there was a murder plot and that Banda had encouraged violence, this would have been very difficult. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached by Macleod for advice. The Royal Commission {{on the future of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission) toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the African nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that African nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.|$|E

They still kept their options open, nevertheless, through dealings with other merchants. The French admired Puankhequa's ability to control officials and pay bribes {{in the right places}} at the right times, but they also saw him as seductive, devious and, according to one French merchant, in possession of [...] "the most evil soul ever to have inhabited a human body".

500|$|Relations between Hervey and the Welsh {{appear to}} have been very bad. The Liber Eliensis {{described}} the situation as follows: Since they [...] did not show the respect and reverence due to a bishop, he [...] wielded the sharp two-edged sword to subdue them, constraining them both with repeated excommunications and with the host of his kinsmen and other followers. They resisted him nonetheless and pressed him with such dangers that they killed his brother and intended <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> the same way, if they could lay hands on him. Hervey was forced to rely on his own armed bands for protection. In 1094 a Welsh revolt against Norman rule in Gwynedd began under the leadership of Gruffudd ap Cynan, and by the late 1090s Hervey had been driven from his diocese by the Welsh. William of Malmesbury, however, states that the reason Hervey left Bangor was that the revenues of the see were too low. He remained nominally Bishop of Bangor until 1109. King Henry I of England tried to translate Hervey to the see of Lisieux in 1106, but the attempt was unsuccessful. The main opposition came from Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, who was the metropolitan of Bangor, and refused to allow Hervey to go to a Norman bishopric. Anselm had the ability to decide the issue as Pope Paschal II had turned the decision of whether to translate Hervey to another see over to Anselm in 1102. While in exile, Hervey served as King Henry's confessor. Bangor itself remained vacant until 1120, when David the Scot was appointed.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, the French Committee of National Liberation {{was late}} to be {{recognized}} by the US as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN, famously calling it a machin ("contraption"), and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct defence treaties between countries. Throughout the Cold War, both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1953, the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General, through its refusal <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> while in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular US bumper sticker read, [...] "You can't spell communism without U.N." [...] In a sometimes-misquoted statement, President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 (referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime) that [...] "free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society." [...] In contrast, the French President, François Hollande, stated in 2012 that [...] "France trusts the United Nations. She knows that no state, no matter how powerful, can solve urgent problems, fight for development and {{bring an end to}} all crises... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance." [...] Critics such as Dore Gold, an Israeli diplomat, Robert S.

500|$|To {{counter the}} British {{threat in the}} Carolinas, Washington had sent Major General Nathanael Greene, {{one of his best}} strategists, to rebuild the American army in North Carolina after the defeat at Camden.

[...] Greene divided his {{inferior}} force, sending part of his army under Daniel Morgan to threaten the British post at Ninety Six, South Carolina. [...] Cornwallis sent Banastre Tarleton after Morgan, who almost wiped out Tarleton's command in the January 1781 Battle of Cowpens, and almost captured Tarleton in the process. [...] This action was followed by what has been called the [...] "race to the Dan," [...] in which Cornwallis gave chase to Morgan and Greene in an attempt to catch them before they reunited their forces. [...] When Greene successfully crossed the Dan River and entered Virginia, Cornwallis, who had stripped his army of most of its baggage, gave up the pursuit. [...] However, Greene received reinforcements and supplies, recrossed the Dan, and returned to Greensboro, North Carolina to do battle with Cornwallis. [...] The earl won the battle, but Greene was able to withdraw with his army intact, and the British suffered enough casualties that Cornwallis was forced to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement and resupply. [...] Greene then went on to regain control over most of South Carolina and Georgia. [...] Cornwallis, in violation of orders but also in the absence of significant strategic direction by General Clinton, decided to take his army, now numbering just 1,400 men, into Virginia on April 25; it was the same day that Phillips and von Steuben fought at Blandford.|$|E
