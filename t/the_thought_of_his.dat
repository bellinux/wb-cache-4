500|$|In the 1760s, Johnson {{established}} his publishing business, which {{focused primarily on}} religious works. He also became friends with Priestley and the artist Henry Fuseli—two relationships that lasted his entire life and brought him much business. In the 1770s and 1780s, Johnson expanded his business, publishing important works in medicine and children's literature {{as well as the}} popular poetry of William Cowper and Erasmus Darwin.

500|$|Over {{the next}} few days morale began to sink when Bf 109s from 7./JG 26, led by Oberleutnant Joachim Müncheberg {{appeared}} over Malta and immediately took a toll of Hurricanes. The British fighter could not match the performance of the Bf 109. MacLachlan took a flight of them by surprise on the 11 February but the German pilots spotted them in time, climbed and dived. According to MacLachlan they [...] "left us standing"—in his diary he noted the poor morale of the squadron owing {{to the success of the}} Bf 109s and he recorded the desperation of pilots eager to shoot one down. On 16 February 1941 MacLachlan's Hurricane Mk. Ia (V7731) was again in battle with the Luftwaffe. In the morning his squadron engaged Bf 109s over Malta. After careful manoeuvring he managed to get onto the tail of a Bf 109 but neglected to check his own six o'clock position. He was hit by cannon fire which shattered his engine and cockpit. His left arm began bleeding profusely and ceased to function. He managed to remove his helmet and radio equipment and slide back the canopy and jump out. MacLachlan gave up trying to reach for his ripcord, assuming it must have been shot off. Later, MacLachlan said he had almost given up altogether when <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother reading the telegram informing her he had been killed in action spurred him on to try once again. He struggled and found the ripcord and deployed his parachute. Exhausted, he landed in a garden and lay there before being recovered.|$|E

500|$|The Griffins' {{business}} has a shaky start and loses money until Joe promises {{to bring his}} friends to the restaurant. Peter is at first excited at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> restaurant becoming the hangout for police officers, but eventually finds that Joe is actually bringing in fellow paraplegics. The restaurant becomes a huge success among handicapped customers, but Peter is disappointed that {{what was supposed to}} be a cool restaurant has become a [...] "cafeteria at the veterans hospital," [...] and did not want to take the profits for granted. Angered, Peter bans them from entering with a [...] "no shirt, no shoes, no legs, no service" [...] policy. Joe is perplexed why Peter would turn away loyal paying customers, much less a good friend like Joe, but Peter stubbornly refuses to allow handicapped customers. In response, the handicapped unite into a giant robot known as [...] "CrippleTron", which begins attacking the restaurant while Peter, Chris and Stewie are on the roof. Stewie eventually takes matters into his own hands and defeats CrippleTron, which falls on Peter, breaking one of his legs. After being taken to the hospital, Peter needs to use a wheelchair for two weeks while his broken leg heals. Peter apologizes to Joe, who accepts his apology on the basis that he is glad to see Peter understand the difficulties of being disabled and that he does not want to continue holding a grudge against Peter. The two make amends, and things go back to the way they were and Peter closes down the restaurant.|$|E
500|$|The {{work was}} an {{adaptation}} of Timothy Shay Arthur's novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There. The Moving Picture World synopsis states: [...] "Despite {{the fact that he}} is a loving husband and father, Joe Morgan ruins his life by his fondness for drink and finally becomes a seemingly hopeless drunkard. He spends his time and money in the saloon kept by Slade, the man who took away Joe's mill and largely caused his financial ruin. Slade's saloon, when he first opened it, was well furnished, the landlord courteous and well groomed, and the customers happy and seemingly unaffected by their surroundings. But as time passed, a change for the worse was noted in everything. Probably this escaped Joe's notice, for a sharp shot, indeed, was needed to reform him. That shock came. Joe's only daughter, Mary, was in the habit of going to the saloon and piteously urging her father to come home. She knew that no matter how intoxicated he might be, he would never harm her. But one evening when she appeared her father and Slade had been quarreling, and the saloonkeeper threw a bottle at Morgan, who dodged. The missile struck the child, entering. The blow resulted fatally, but before Mary died, she extracted a promise from her grief-stricken father that he would never drink again, a promise which he ever-afterward kept. In later years Joe became wealthy and respected, and influenced by <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter in heaven he kept in the straight and narrow path. The saloon keeper who killed Mary was never punished by the law - but through the irony of fate his taking off was much like that of Joe Morgan's helpless child." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} narrated by Orrec Caspro, {{the son of}} Canoc, master of the domain of Caspromant. The gift that his family {{possesses}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "unmake" [...] things, but his gift seems to manifest very late, and he is unable to control it. Later he seems to strike down his pet dog, and then destroy an entire hillside with his power. He decides the death was his fault, and horrified by <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> power out of control, demands that he be blindfolded. Orrec's battles with his power and its potential to destroy have been described {{as an example of a}} person's confrontation with their own shadow, a common theme in Le Guin's writing. The blindfold initially brings him some peace. Unable to see the real world, he lives within the stories that Melle has told him, Eventually he begins to retell the stories to his mother, and to add to them himself. When Melle asks to see his face without the blindfold one last time, he realizes he couldn't have hurt her, and feels the [...] "dry fury of impotent regret." [...] After his mother's death he descends into grief and rage, which he eventually emerges from with Gry's assistance. At Gry's suggestion he begins to remove his blindfold to read the books his mother writes for him. Orrec comes to realizes that his father has unintentionally tricked him into believing in his wild gift, so as to protect his domain. He confronts his father [...] Orrec eventually realizes that he prefers [...] "making" [...] to unmaking. Gry and he get married, and leave the Uplands. Scholar Sandra Lindow has pointed out that Orrec's name is similar to [...] "auric", meaning [...] "related to hearing", and that it brings to mind the word [...] "oracle", describing his discovery of his power to create and perform. Orrec's emotional journey during his blindfoldment has been compared to that of the biblical character Jonah, as well as to that of Max in the Maurice Sendak children's picture book Where the Wild Things Are.|$|E

Noriko talks about what a nice person Onodera's new wife is, and how embarrassed she feels for having called Onodera's remarriage [...] "filthy." [...] Shukichi assures her that she should not worry about it, because Onodera never took her words seriously. After Noriko confesses to her father that she found <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own remarriage [...] "distasteful," [...] she looks over to discover that he is already asleep, or seems to be.

[...] The King replied: [...] "No answer." [...] George III seriously thought of abdicating at this time, after the comprehensive defeat of his American policy and the imposition of Fox and North, but refrained from doing so, mainly because of <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> succession by his son, George Augustus Frederick: the notoriously extravagant womaniser, gambler and associate of Fox, who could swear in three languages. Indeed, in many ways the King considered Fox his son's tutor in debauchery. [...] "George III let it be widely broadcast that he held Fox principally responsible for the Prince’s many failings, not least a tendency to vomit in public." ...|$|E
