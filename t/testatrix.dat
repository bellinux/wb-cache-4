60|$|Moreover, with tender care, {{except for}} certain bequests to servants, the <b>testatrix</b> devoted all her Swiss moneys {{to be applied}} to the upkeep of the place, with the proviso that if it were sold these capital sums should revert to her other heirs in certain proportions. The total of such moneys as would pass with the property, was {{estimated}} by the notary to amount to about £4,000 sterling, after the payment of all State charges and legal expenses. The value of the property itself, with the fine old French furniture and pictures which it contained, was also considerable, but unascertained. For the rest it would appear that Godfrey inherited about £12,000 in England, together with a possible further sum of which the amount was not known, as residuary legatee. This bequest was vested in the English trustees of the <b>testatrix</b> who were instructed to apply the interest for his benefit until he reached the age of twenty-five, after which the capital was to be handed over to him absolutely.|$|E
60|$|In these 'uses, ends, and purposes' lay {{the cream}} of the affair. The first was {{introduced}} by a preamble setting forth that the <b>testatrix</b> was lineally descended from the ancient house of Ellangowan, her respected great-grandfather, Andrew Bertram, first of Singleside, of happy memory, having been second son to Allan Bertram, fifteenth Baron of Ellangowan. It proceeded to state that Henry Bertram, son and heir of Godfrey Bertram, now of Ellangowan, had been stolen from his parents in infancy, but that she, the <b>testatrix,</b> WAS WELL ASSURED THAT HE WAS YET ALIVE IN FOREIGN PARTS, AND BY THE PROVIDENCE OF HEAVEN WOULD BE RESTORED TO THE POSSESSIONS OF HIS ANCESTORS, in which case the said Peter Protocol was bound and obliged, like as he bound and obliged himself, by acceptance of these presents, to denude himself of the said lands of Singleside and others, and of all the other effects thereby conveyed (excepting always a proper gratification for his own trouble), to and in favour of the said Henry Bertram, upon his return to his native country. And during the time of his residing in foreign parts, or in case of his never again returning to Scotland, Mr. Peter Protocol, the trustee, was directed to distribute the rents of the land, and interest of the other funds (deducting always a proper gratification for his trouble in the premises), in equal portions, among four charitable establishments pointed out in the will. The power of management, of letting leases, of raising and lending out money, in short, the full authority of a proprietor, was vested in this confidential trustee, and, in the event of his death, went to certain official persons named in the deed. There were only two legacies; one of a hundred pounds to a favourite waiting-maid, another of the like sum to Janet Gibson (whom the deed stated to have been supported by the charity of the <b>testatrix),</b> for the purpose of binding her an apprentice to some honest trade.|$|E

From a sample of 96 testaments taken from the community of Ures District, in Sonora, from the 1862 - 1902 period, {{it was possible to}} underline some aspects of the various succession patterns used by testators and <b>testatrixes,</b> their relationships within and outside the family, their affection and indifference feelings, as well as to emphasize the economic role played by Ures women as single and married women, and widows. This aspects help understand why some women turned into a means of support for her husband or her family, and gave her daily life texture in order to demonstrate that women, as social players, are present and are part of a historical period...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} was {{necessarily}} very sad. Clara had declared her determination to follow her aunt to the churchyard, and did so, together with Martha, the old servant. There were three or four mourning coaches, as family friends came over from Taunton, {{one or two of}} whom were to be present at the reading of the will. How melancholy was the occasion, and how well the work was done; how substantial and yet how solemn was the luncheon, spread after the funeral for the gentlemen; and how the will was read, without a word of remark, by Mr. Palmer, need hardly be told here. The will contained certain substantial legacies to servants--the amount to that old handmaid Martha being so great as to produce a fit of fainting, after which the old handmaid declared that if ever there was, by any chance, an angel of light upon the earth, it was her late mistress; and yet Martha had had her troubles with her mistress; and there was a legacy of two hundred pounds to the gentleman who was called upon to act as co-executor with Captain Aylmer. Other clause in the will there was none, except that one substantial clause which bequeathed to her well-beloved nephew, Frederic Folliott Aylmer, everything of which the <b>testatrix</b> died possessed. The will had been made at some moment in which Clara's spirit of independence had offended her aunt, and her name was not mentioned. That nothing should have been left to Clara was the one thing that surprised the relatives from Taunton who were present. The relatives from Taunton, to give them their due, expected nothing for themselves; but as there had been great doubt as to the proportions in which the property would be divided between the nephew and adopted niece, there was aroused a considerable excitement as to the omission of the name of Miss Amedroz--an excitement which was not altogether unpleasant. When people complain of some cruel shame, which does not affect themselves personally, the complaint is generally accompanied by an unexpressed and unconscious feeling of satisfaction.|$|E
50|$|In Kirsten v Bailey, an {{important}} {{case in the}} South African law of succession, the <b>testatrix</b> made three wills. In {{the first and the}} third, Bailey was nominated as the sole beneficiary of her estate; in the second will Kirsten was nominated as the sole beneficiary. Kirsten challenged the validity of the third will. The court held that Bailey had led the <b>testatrix</b> to believe that he would leave her unless she appointed him her sole heir. Thus Kirsten had proved that the <b>testatrix</b> was unduly influenced and accordingly lacked the requisite capacity. Thus, the <b>testatrix</b> was held to have died intestate. The intestate heirs happened to be the beneficiaries nominated in the second will. If the court declares the last in a series of wills to be invalid ab initio, the deceased is deemed to have died intestate. The court will not give effect to an earlier will, as it has already been revoked.|$|E

5000|$|After {{going into}} private {{practice}} as a surveyor and architect, Macaulay faced some financial difficulty and misappropriated funds from an estate he served as executor for. His actions were uncovered by the authorities who tried him and sentenced him {{to two years in}} prison. The historian Patrick Dele-Cole outlines evidence suggesting that Macaulay was unfairly persecuted at his 1913 trial. The prosecuting counsel, one Robert Irving, was Herbert Macaulay's tenant who may have pursued a private vendetta. Macaulay had obtained a court order to evict Robert Irving on December 3, 1912. Additionally, Macaulay's lawyers encountered severe difficulties putting up a solid defense {{in the course of the}} case: as an example Macaulay's lawyers were unable to find the police magistrate anywhere in Lagos to obtain bail. Other incidents include the acting Chief Justice fining Macaulay £100 despite the five assessors in the court returning a not guilty verdict. Cole also underscores Macaulay's scrupulous transparency regarding the trust. According to Cole [...] "the will of the <b>testatrix</b> was read in public at the request of Macaulay and the loan he obtained in order the clear the debts of the <b>testatrix</b> was explained to the beneficiaries of the will (Macaulay's niece was the principal beneficiary and she certainly did not engage Irving to prosecute the case), yet he was convicted of 'intent to defraud'". Finally, Cole notes that Macaulay's sentence of five years was [...] "unusually severe".|$|E
50|$|As to solicitors, Ross v. Caunters 1979 3 AER 580, {{holds that}} lawyers can owe a {{duty of care}} both to their clients and to third parties who suffer loss or damage. In that case, the solicitors failed to prevent a {{beneficiary}} from attesting the will. They admitted negligence but denied that they were liable to the claimant, contending (i) that a solicitor was liable only to his client and then only in contract and not in tort and could not, therefore, be liable in tort to a third party, (ii) that for reasons of policy, a solicitor {{ought not to be}} liable in negligence to anyone except his client, and (iii) that in any event, the Plaintiff had no cause of action in negligence because the damage suffered was purely financial. Applying the principles in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd and Donoghue v Stevenson 1932 AC 562, a solicitor who is instructed by a client to carry out a transaction that will confer a benefit on a third party owes a duty of care towards the third party in carrying out that transaction, in that the third party is a person within his direct contemplation as someone who is likely to be so closely and directly affected by his acts or omissions that he can reasonably foresee that the third party is likely to be injured by those acts or omissions. This was confirmed in White v Jones 1995 1 AER 691 which applied Caparo Industries plc v Dickman 1990 1 AER 568 holding that there is a close and direct relationship characterised by the law as proximity or neighbourhood; and the situation is one where it is fair, just and reasonable that the law should impose the duty of the given scope upon the one party {{for the benefit of the}} other. But in Carr-Glynn v Frearsons 1997 2 AER 614 the solicitor admitted uncertainty as to whether the will as drawn would be effective. The <b>testatrix</b> undertook to seek out the information needed to clarify the issue. She died more than three years later without verifying the will. White v Jones was distinguished because the <b>testatrix</b> had assumed the duty of care, but the court was critical of the failure of the solicitors to send a letter of reminder. The case law also indicates the necessity for firms of solicitors to keep detailed attendance notes.|$|E
5000|$|In Georgia, {{joint tenancy}} is {{commonly}} conveyed in a deed as [...] "Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship". The legal {{effect of this}} type of tenancy is a [...] "life estate" [...] with a [...] "contingent remainder". Translated, this means that the interest of each joint tenant can be thought of in two parts: the [...] "present" [...] interest while the parties are both alive and what happens in the [...] "future" [...] when one of the tenants dies. Viewed separately, the interest of each independent co-tenant is only [...] "temporary" [...] interest while they both co-tenants are alive and neither owns a [...] "full" [...] interest. The [...] "full" [...] interest is determined by who outlives the other and vests automatically in the survivor at, and only at, the time of death. In the case of a mortgage executed by only one of the living joint tenants, the mortgage does not sever the tenancy. Instead, the mortgage is interpreted as conveying whatever interest the debtor holds. In this example, that would be the debtor's life (or [...] "temporary") estate only, since both parties are still living, but the lender would also be entitled to the full estate, but only if the debtor were to outlive the other joint-tenant. Consequently, if the debtor dies first, the co-tenant, who is not party to the mortgage, would take full ownership interest of the property free and clear of the mortgage. However, just because a surviving co-tenant isn't liable on the mortgage {{does not mean that the}} mortgage is extinguished or that the property is not subject to foreclosure if the mortgage isn't paid. The Georgia Supreme Court decision of Manders v. King, 284 Ga. 338, 339, 667 S.E.2d 59, 60 (2008) is instructive. [...] "Georgia is one of several states adhering to the common-law doctrine of exoneration, which provides that, unless a will specifically provides otherwise, an heir or devisee of real property may look to the decedent's personal property for satisfaction of liens on devised real property, at the expense of the residuary legatees or distributees of the decedent's personal estate. J. Kraut, Annotation, Right of Heir or Devisee to Have Realty Exonerated from Lien Thereon at Expense of Personal Estate, 4 A.L.R.3d 1023, § 3. See Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 458, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) (“Under the general law it was the duty of the executors to discharge this particular mortgage debt devised real property from the personal property of the <b>testatrix,</b> if any she had....”). See also Killingsworth v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 237 Ga. 544, 546, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (estate required to exonerate devised real property by paying balance of mortgage liens so long as the liens were debts of the testator and not an assumption of debts of a predecessor in title). Id. In Manders, the Court held “a surviving joint tenant does not qualify for exoneration of a mortgage on joint tenancy property unless there is language in the decedent's will clearly expressing an intention that the mortgage debt be paid.” In re Estate of Young, supra; In re Estate of Dolley, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at 72.2. In short, if there is a mortgage on a property that was executed by only one joint-tenant and that joint-tenant dies, unless there is a specific provision in the Will of the deceased joint-tenant that estate assets should be used to pay the outstanding mortgage, then surviving joint-tenant is not exonerated from the mortgage and the property is subject to foreclosure if the mortgage goes into default.|$|E

40|$|The CY-Pres Doctrine. -The {{court of}} {{chancery}} of New Jersey {{in the recent}} case of Brow et al. v. Condit et al. (Sept. 30, 1905), 61 Atl. Rep. 1055, refused to apply this doctrine under the following circumstances: The will of one Susan M. Corson, bearing date July 7, 1897, disposed of her residuary estate 2 ̆ 2 to the Hospital Fund for Sick Seamen at Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, care of Mr. John M. Wood, chaplain. 2 ̆ 2 It appears that neither {{at the time of}} the making of the will nor at any time thereafter was there a fund in existence at or in any way connected with the Brooklyn, New York, Navy Yard that could properly be designated as a 2 ̆ 2 fund for sick seamen. 2 ̆ 2 Nor was the said John M. Wood, {{at the time of the}} making the will or thereafter a chaplain at said navy yard in any proper sense of the term. He was, however, for several years previous to his death, which took place about a year after the date of the will and about the same time prior to the death of the <b>testatrix,</b> engaged more or less in missionary work at the said navy yard under the auspices of the American Seamen 2 ̆ 7 s Friend Society. His duties consisted chiefly in holding religious meetings, and although he had no official connection with the government hospital located at the said navy yard, he had, as stated in the opinion of the court, 2 ̆ 2 the privilege of ministering to the sick sailors in the hospital, presumably to such extent as his services were acceptable to them. 2 ̆ 2 Similar privileges were given to the representatives of other benevolent societies. On several occasions, whether before or after the making of her will does not appear, Mrs. Corson sent to Mr. Wood small sums of money with directions, in each instance, that he should with the money get delicacies and flowers for the sick sailors. The court found nothing in the evidence to show that the <b>testatrix</b> was ever interested in any charitable work at the said navy yard except as it was connected with Mr. Wood. After the death of the latter the American Seamen 2 ̆ 7 s Friend Society continued its work at the navy yard through other lay missionaries. It appeared, also, that the International Committee of Young Men 2 ̆ 7 s Christian Associations, one of the defendants in the case, in March, 1899, established a branch for charitable work among the sailors in the Brooklyn, New York, Navy Yard, their work being of the same kind as that carried on by the American Seamen 2 ̆ 7 s Friend Society, but apparently somewhat wider in its scope...|$|E

Tubes are attached to skeletons of sponges, crinoids, brachiopods and stromatoporoids. The material consists of about twenty incomplete tubes (attached and free portions) and includes some small tubes, ca. 0. 2 mm wide, belonging to the sabellid Glomerula (with the species G. <b>testatrix</b> comb. nov. and G. gemmellaroi sp. nov.), the serpulid Filograna sp., and large-sized tubes, up to 3 mm wide, belonging to three newly described serpulids: Propomatoceros permianus sp. nov., “Serpula” distefanoi sp. nov., and Serpulidae sp. indet. They are triangular or circular in cross-sections, and display growth lines and/or ornamentations (keels or ribs) on their outer surfaces.

40|$|The {{case now}} known as Ilott v The Blue Cross [2017] UKSC 17 {{was the first time}} that the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 was {{considered}} at the highest judicial level. The Court of Appeal ([2015] EWCA Civ 797, noted [2016] C. L. J. 31) had significantly enhanced the award given to an estranged and “disinherited” but needy daughter (Heather Ilott) at the expense of the charities (the Blue Cross, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) who were the principal beneficiaries under her mother (Melita Jackson) ’s will, leaving her with £ 143, 000 out of the £ 486, 000 estate primarily to purchase the council house in which she and her family were living. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the charities’ appeal, restoring Judge Million’s original £ 50, 000 order. Giving the lead judgment, Lord Hughes reasserted the centrality of testamentary freedom in English Law, emphasised the importance of the Act’s limitation to “reasonable financial provision” for maintenance for non-spouse/civil partner applicants (s. 1 (2) (b)), and held that a need for maintenance was a necessary but not sufficient condition for a successful claim. He approved previous case law in holding that maintenance could not “extend to any or every thing which it would be desirable for the claimant to have” ([14]), but was not limited to “subsistence” either ([15]). He also confirmed that the focus of the correct test under the 1975 Act is not on the behaviour of the <b>testatrix,</b> but opined the reasonableness of her decision may still be a significant consideration, as may the extent of any “moral claim” even if that is not a “sine qua non” ([20]) ...|$|E
