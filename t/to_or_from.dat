5|$|All {{three main}} {{terminals}} {{used by the}} Eurostar service – St Pancras International, Paris Gare du Nord, and Brussels Midi/Zuid – are served by domestic trains and by local urban transport networks such as the London Underground and the Paris Metro. Standard Eurostar tickets no longer include free onward connections <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> any other station in Belgium: this is now available for a flat-rate supplement, currently £5.50.|$|E
5|$|Canberrans are {{relatively}} young, highly mobile, and well educated. The median age is 35 years, and only 12.7% {{of the population}} is aged over 65 years. Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> Canberra, which was the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city. According to statistics collected by the National Australia Bank and reported in The Canberra Times, Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories, for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income.|$|E
5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It amounts to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E

5|$|In early 1799 Prudente was {{operating}} off South Africa, attacking British trade passing <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> the Cape Colony {{when the ship}} was discovered by British frigate HMS Daedalus under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Prudente turned away and Ball gave chase, following the French ship closely. After five hours Daedalus caught Prudente and fired a raking broadside into the stern, disabling the French ship. For another hour the action continued at close range until Prudente was forced to surrender.|$|E

The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|Northern line trains first {{served the}} station on 3 July 1939. After {{completion}} of the electrification of the line to High Barnet, Underground services were extended northwards on 14 April 1940. The station continued to be served by LNER steam trains from Highgate until 2 March 1941 when that service was discontinued. The inner platforms are now used only by northbound trains entering service or southbound trains terminating at East Finchley on their way <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> Highgate Wood depot south of the station.|$|E
5|$|On November 21, 2008, {{construction}} {{began on}} the reconstruction of Interchange 17, with completion on June 18, 2010. As a result of reconstructing this interchange, the SJTA approved raising the interchange toll to $3.00. This new rate is charged to motorists heading <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> the east along the Atlantic City Expressway at Route 50. The proposal drew opposition from area officials who felt the proposed rate was too high. The westbound exit and eastbound entrance at Interchange 17 {{was designed to be}} E-ZPass only, the first such interchange on the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E

In the 2006/07 financial year, over 50,000 passengers used Filton Abbey Wood to travel <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> Bristol Temple Meads. The line through Filton Abbey Wood has a loading gauge of W8, {{and the line}} handles over 15 million train tonnes per year. It is not electrified, though it is planned {{that it will be}} electrified as part of the 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line.|$|E

Some places on or near the route are also served by bus. The St. Kevins (sic) Bus Service stops at Roundwood, Laragh and Glendalough. The Wicklow Way Bus provides services to Laragh, Glendalough, Glenmalure, Iron Bridge and Tinahely.|$|E
5|$|Wood Lane {{station was}} {{modified}} and extended {{to accommodate the}} northward extension tracks linking to the E The existing platforms on the loop were retained, continuing {{to be used by}} trains that were turning back to central London, and two new platforms for trains running <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> Ealing were constructed at a lower level on the new tracks, which connected to each side of the loop. Ealing Broadway station was modified to provide additional platforms for CLR use between the existing but separate sets of platforms used by the GWR and the DR.|$|E
5|$|Along Line 2, {{the station}} is located between the Jinke Road station and the Tangzhen station. It takes {{approximately}} 60 minutes to ride the train to the East Xujing station, {{the west end of}} the line, and 34 minutes to the Pudong Airport station, the eastern terminus. The train operates from 5:30 to 22:45 westbound and from 6:30 to 21:00 eastbound. On weekdays, trains leave the station approximately every 3 minutes and 30 seconds during peak hours and every four to ten minutes during non-peak hours. Peak hours are defined as from 7:30 to 9:30 and 17:00 to 19:00 on Monday through Thursday, as well as 7:00 to 9:00 and 12:50 to 20:30 on Friday. On weekends, trains leave the stations every 4 minutes and 5 seconds from 8:00 to 20:30, and every five to ten minutes during other times. The station is a transfer station for passengers traveling <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> points east on Line 2. From Guanglan Road to the east, Line 2 uses 4-carriage trains; to the west Line 2 uses 8-carriage trains.|$|E

5|$|Another {{very common}} {{component}} of distributed element filters is the stub. Over {{a narrow range}} of frequencies, a stub {{can be used as}} a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt LC antiresonators, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC resonator. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> the length).|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} upper level, the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the lower level, merges with the innermost, express tracks located on the lower level, and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the upper level before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The lower level tracks can only be reached by trains running <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>from</b> the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
