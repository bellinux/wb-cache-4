500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>local</b> dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) graphics mode.|$|E

She begins with [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] holding a rifle and [...] "breaks" [...] the glass, of a confessional box, she later performs [...] "Revolver" [...] with female dancers dancing with automatic rifles. During the third song, [...] "Gang Bang" [...] she performed in a motel setting where she is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrops. In wake of the 2012 Aurora shooting, Madonna was urged to remove the use of firearms from the show. Authorities previously warned the singer about use of guns for the concert in Edinburgh, before the events in Colorado. However, the order was reinforced after the tragedy occurred. Madonna continued the show in Scotland as planned, {{with the use of the}} props. During the concert, she expressed her joy for first concert in the country, saying she could be onstage for three hours. She then joked, [...] "Due to your laws here they might pull the plug on me so if they cut us off suddenly, write <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>local</b> MP".|$|E
