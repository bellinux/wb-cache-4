5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and <b>tubulin</b> are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to <b>tubulin</b> dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|Vinca {{alkaloids}} {{are derived}} from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (formerly known as Vinca rosea). They bind to specific sites on <b>tubulin,</b> inhibiting the assembly of <b>tubulin</b> into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are natural products that include vincristine and vinblastine. Following {{the success of these}} drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: vinorelbine (used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer), vindesine, and vinflunine. These drugs are cell cycle-specific. They bind to the <b>tubulin</b> molecules in S-phase and prevent proper microtubule formation required for M-phase.|$|E
40|$|Intact A microtubules {{isolated}} from outer doublet microtubules of Chlamydomonas flagella contain two separable proteins (<b>tubulins)</b> that differ in molecular weight and in amino-acid composition. The microtubule protein {{isolated from}} brain or neuroblastoma cells also has two electrophoretically distinct <b>tubulins.</b> Although the two <b>tubulins</b> of brain and neuroblastoma cells are electrophoretically similar to each other, {{only one of}} these <b>tubulins</b> migrates with the flagellar <b>tubulins.</b> This is the first evidence that (a) isolated, morphologically intact, single microtubules from flagella contain at least two different <b>tubulins,</b> and (b) {{at least one of these}} <b>tubulins</b> differs from <b>tubulins</b> that are isolated from other sources...|$|R
40|$|Sea-urchin <b>tubulins</b> can be {{assembled}} in vitro to form microtubules provided that a suitable seed is present. Although fragments of sea-urchin microtubules {{fail to act}} as seeds, since they apparently dissociate, short pieces of rat brain microtubule will act as nucleation sites for the assembly of sea-urchin <b>tubulins.</b> In addition, rat brain <b>tubulins</b> appear to undergo {{a certain amount of}} in vitro assembly when seeded with fragments of microtubules derived from sea-urchin sperm tails. Assembly on a heterologous seed indicates that the current in vitro assembly conditions may be insufficiently stringent...|$|R
5000|$|Homologs of α- and β-tubulin {{have been}} {{identified}} in the Prosthecobacter genus of bacteria. [...] They are designated BtubA and BtubB to identify them as bacterial <b>tubulins.</b> Both exhibit homology to both α- and β-tubulin. While structurally highly similar to eukaryotic <b>tubulins,</b> they have several unique features, including chaperone-free folding and weak dimerization. Electron cryomicroscopy showed that BtubA/B form microtubules in vivo, and that these microtubules comprise only five protofilaments, in contrast to eukaryotic microtubules, which usually contain 13.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tubulin</b> is {{also known}} to be phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, sumoylated, and palmitoylated.|$|E
25|$|Nocodazole, vincristine, and {{colchicine}} {{have the}} opposite effect, blocking the polymerization of <b>tubulin</b> into microtubules.|$|E

40|$|Polyglutamylation is a posttranslational {{modification}} {{that generates}} lateral acidic side chains on proteins by sequential addition of glutamate amino acids. This modification was first discovered on <b>tubulins</b> {{and it is}} important for several microtubule functions. Besides <b>tubulins,</b> only the nucleosome assembly proteins NAP 1 and NAP 2 {{have been shown to be}} polyglutamylated. Here, using a proteomic approach, we identify a large number of putative substrates for polyglutamylation in HeLa cells. By analyzing a selection of these putative substrates, we show that several of them can serve as in vitro substrates for two of the recently discovered polyglutamylases...|$|R
25|$|The cancer-fighting taxane {{class of}} drugs (paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel) block dynamic {{instability}} by stabilizing GDP-bound <b>tubulin</b> in the microtubule. Thus, even when hydrolysis of GTP reaches {{the tip of}} the microtubule, there is no depolymerization and the microtubule does not shrink back.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to pregnenolone, its {{synthetic}} derivative 3β-methoxypregnenolone (MAP-4343), and progesterone, DHEA {{has been}} found to bind to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), specifically the MAP2C subtype (Kd = 27µM). However, it is unclear whether DHEA increases binding of MAP2 to <b>tubulin</b> like pregnenolone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tubulin</b> and microtubule-mediated processes, like cell locomotion, {{were seen}} by early microscopists, like Leeuwenhoek (1677). However, the fibrous nature of flagella and other {{structures}} were discovered two centuries later, with improved light microscopes, and confirmed in the 20th with electron microscope and biochemical studies.|$|E
50|$|BtubA/B {{are found}} in some {{bacterial}} species in the Verrucomicrobial genus Prosthecobacter. Their evolutionary relationship to eukaryotic <b>tubulins</b> is unclear, although they may have descended from a eukaryotic lineage by lateral gene transfer.|$|R
40|$|The mitotic {{chromosome}} movements {{are discussed in}} relation with recent studies on <b>tubulins,</b> their assembly and disassembly, and the associated proteins. The role of contractile proteins in the mitotic spindle is considered, and also that of the calcium regulating protein (CDR) which has been demonstrated recently in the mitotic spindle. The study of more 'primitive' mitoses underlines the differences between polar and chromosomal MT. The linear growth of the first, and the sliding movements of MT from opposing poles, explain the growth in length of the mitotic figure and the separation of chromosomes. The complex relations between various types of MT {{and the possibility of}} biochemical varieties of <b>tubulins,</b> are discussed. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Polyglutamylation {{is a form}} of {{reversible}} posttranslational {{modification of}} glutamate residues seen for example in alpha and beta <b>tubulins,</b> nucleosome assembly proteins NAP1 and NAP2. The γ-carboxy group of glutamate may form peptide-like bond with the amino group of a free glutamate whose α-carboxy group can now be extended into a polyglutamate chain. The glutamylation is done by the enzyme glutamylase and removed by deglutamylase. Polyglutamylation of chain length of up to six occurs in certain glutamate residues near the C terminus of most major forms of <b>tubulins.</b> These residues, though themselves not involved in direct binding, cause conformational shifts that regulate binding of microtubule associated proteins (MAP and Tau) and motors.|$|R
25|$|Detyrosination: {{the removal}} of the C-terminal {{tyrosine}} from alpha-tubulin. This reaction exposes a glutamate at the new C-terminus. As a result, microtubules that accumulate this modification are often referred to as Glu-microtubules. Although the <b>tubulin</b> carboxypeptidase has yet to be identified, the tubulin—tyrosine ligase (TTL) is known.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} docetaxel is exerted by promoting and stabilising microtubule assembly, while preventing physiological microtubule depolymerisation/disassembly {{in the absence}} of GTP. This leads to a significant decrease in free <b>tubulin,</b> needed for microtubule formation and results in inhibition of mitotic cell division between metaphase and anaphase, preventing further cancer cell progeny.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tubulin</b> beta-3 {{chain is}} a protein that in humans is encoded by the TUBB3 gene. Class III β-tubulin is constitutively {{expressed}} in neural tissues. and in testis cells and conditionally {{expressed in a}} number of other tissues after exposure to a toxic microenvironment featured by hypoxia and poor nutrient supply. Posttranslational changes including phosphorylation and glycosylation are required for functional activity.|$|E
50|$|Naegleria amoeba {{undergo a}} closed mitosis, {{in which the}} nuclear {{envelope}} doesnt break down, but still proceeds through the typical stages. The multitubulin hypothesis predicts that eukaryotes contain multiple tublin genes with distinct properties. Naegleria uses different <b>tubulins</b> for mitosis and flagellar assembly.|$|R
50|$|Crescentin is {{a protein}} {{which is a}} {{bacterial}} relative of the intermediate filaments found in eukaryotic cells. Just as <b>tubulins</b> and actins, the other major cytoskeletal proteins, have prokaryotic homologs in, respectively, the FtsZ and MreB proteins, intermediate filaments {{are linked to the}} crescentin protein.|$|R
40|$|Actins and <b>tubulins</b> have {{dedicated}} {{functions that}} vary between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. During cell division, the prokaryotic contractile ring {{depends on the}} tubulin-like protein FtsZ, whereas this task relies on actin in eukaryotes. In contrast, microtubules orchestrate DNA segregation in eukaryotes, yet prokaryotic plasmid segregation often depends on actin-like proteins; this implies that actins and <b>tubulins</b> have somewhat interchangeable properties. Hence, we sought a bacterial filament that more closely resembles microtubules. Here, we report an actin from Bacillus thuringiensis that forms dynamic, antiparallel, two-stranded supercoiled filaments, which pair {{in the presence of}} a binding partner to form hollow cylinders. Thus, in this prokaryote, the actin fold has evolved to produce a filament system with comparable properties to the eukaryotic microtubule...|$|R
25|$|Podophyllotoxin is an antineoplastic lignan {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the American Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) and Himalayan Mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum or Podophyllum emodi). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism {{is similar to that}} of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to <b>tubulin,</b> inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action: etoposide and teniposide.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{successfully}} complete their folding, both actin and <b>tubulin</b> need {{to interact with}} another protein called prefoldin, which is a heterohexameric complex (formed by six distinct subunits), in an interaction that is so specific that the molecules have coevolved. Actin complexes with prefoldin while it is still being formed, when it is approximately 145 amino acids long, specifically those at the N-terminal.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} cytoskeleton {{may not be}} {{as complex}} as that found in eukaryotes; however, it contains proteins that are highly similar to actin monomers and polymers. The bacterial protein MreB polymerizes into thin non-helical filaments and occasionally into helical structures similar to F-actin. Furthermore, its crystalline structure is very similar to that of G-actin (in terms of its three-dimensional conformation), there are even similarities between the MreB protofilaments and F-actin. The bacterial cytoskeleton also contains the FtsZ proteins, which are similar to <b>tubulin.</b>|$|E
40|$|The polo-like kinase (Plk) {{family has}} been shown to have an {{important}} role in the regulation of the cell-division cycle, especially in organization of the spindle structure, in species from fungi to humans. Recent reports have demonstrated that in mammalian cells Plk is associated with components of the anaphase-promoting complex and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin 1. To characterize a putative Plk-containing complex, we fractionated mitotic cell lysates on a gel-filtration column. The Plk complex was eluted from the column at molecular sizes ranging from 669 to 2500 kDa in the presence of detergent and high concentrations of salt. Specific associations of Plk with alpha-, beta- and gamma-tubulins in both interphase and mitotic cells were shown by reciprocal immunoprecipitations and immunoblottings and were independent of the microtubule polymerization state, whereas binding assays in vitro indicated that Plk interacts with alpha- and beta-tubulins directly. In addition, mitotic Plk was able to phosphorylate associated <b>tubulins</b> in vitro. Finally, we show that the kinase domain of the Plk molecule is both required and sufficient for its binding to <b>tubulins</b> in vivo. The specific interaction between Plk and <b>tubulins</b> might provide a molecular basis for the physiological functions of Plk in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in establishing the normal bipolar spindle...|$|R

25|$|The {{cell body}} of a neuron is {{supported}} by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the <b>tubulin</b> of microtubules. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{point out}} that the {{behaviour}} of actin, <b>tubulin</b> and histone, a protein involved in the stabilization and regulation of DNA, are similar in their ability to bind nucleotides and in their ability of take advantage of Brownian motion. It has also been suggested that they all have a common ancestor. Therefore, evolutionary processes resulted in the diversification of ancestral proteins into the varieties present today, conserving, among others, actins as efficient molecules that were able to tackle essential ancestral biological processes, such as endocytosis.|$|E
25|$|Docetaxel binds to microtubules {{reversibly}} {{with high}} affinity {{and has a}} maximum stoichiometry of 1 mole docetaxel per mole <b>tubulin</b> in microtubules. This binding stabilizes microtubules and prevents depolymerisation from calcium ions, decreased temperature and dilution, preferentially at the plus end of the microtubule. Docetaxel {{has been found to}} accumulate to higher concentration in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells than kidney carcinoma cells, which may contribute to the more effective treatment of ovarian cancer by docetaxel. It has also been found to lead to the phosphorylation of oncoprotein bcl-2, which is apoptosis-blocking in its oncoprotein form.|$|E

40|$|Life {{falls into}} three {{fundamental}} domains [...] Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya (formerly archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes,. respectively). Though Archaea lack nuclei and share many morphological features with Bacteria, molecular analyses, principally of the transcription and translation machineries, {{have suggested that}} Archaea are more related to Eucarya than to Bacteria. Currently, {{little is known about}} the archaeal cell division apparatus. In Bacteria, a crucial component of the cell division machinery is FtsZ, a GTPase that localizes to a ring at the site of septation. Interestingly, FtsZ is distantly related in sequence to eukaryotic <b>tubulins,</b> which also interact with GTP and are components of the eukaryotic cell cytoskeleton. By screening for the ability to bind radiolabeled nucleotides, we have identified a protein of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus woesei that interacts tightly and specifically with GTP. Furthermore, through screening an expression library of P. woesei genomic DNA, we have cloned the gene encoding this protein. Sequence comparisons reveal that the P. woesei GTP-binding protein is strikingly related in sequence to eubacterial FtsZ and is marginally more similar to eukaryotic <b>tubulins</b> than are bacterial FtsZ proteins. Phylogenetic analyses reinforce the notion that there is an evolutionary linkage between FtsZ and <b>tubulins.</b> These findings suggest that the archaeal cell division apparatus may be fundamentally similar to that of Bacteria and lead us to consider the evolutionary relationships between Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya...|$|R
50|$|This {{gene product}} {{belongs to the}} tektin family of proteins. Tektins {{comprise}} a family of filament-forming proteins that are coassembled with <b>tubulins</b> to form ciliary and flagellar microtubules. This gene is predominantly expressed in the testis and in mouse, tektin 1 mRNA was localized to the spermatocytes and round spermatids in the seminiferous tubules, indicating that it {{may play a role}} in spermatogenesis.|$|R
