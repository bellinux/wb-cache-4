5|$|The {{north side}} of the DeKalb County Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but each has its own distinctive qualities. The courthouse drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on the courthouse property. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building features four pilasters with composite capitals which give the courthouse a temple appearance.|$|E
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of {{the outline of the}} skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E

5|$|The talonid {{contains}} a hypoconid, hypoconulid, and entoconid and is much {{wider than the}} trigonid because the hypoconid is displaced buccally. A cristid obliqua descends from the hypoconid and reaches the protoconid. Although a crest, the postmetacristid, descends from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metaconid, ending in a small cusp, the metastylid, it is separated from the entoconid by a notch. The living colugos lack such a strong postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is near the back lingual margin of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In D.major, this cusp is further to the back than in both D.chimaera and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo. In D.chimaera, a low crest, the post-hypoconulid cristid, reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a small cuspule, the distocuspid, is located. A long crest, the postcristid, connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is similar, but in D.major, both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are absent, and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid.|$|E

25|$|The {{dream of}} a {{shipping}} canal connecting the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain goes back to Spanish colonial times (1763–1803). The colonial era Carondelet Canal connected <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Quarter with the lake via Bayou St. John, {{but it was not}} extended to the river because of the differing levels of the river and the lake. Engineers confirmed that canal locks would be necessary.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been quilted, the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind a quilt. One of the simplest involves sewing {{one side of a}} strip of fabric to the front side of the quilt, through all of the layers of fabric, then folding the strip over to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabric and hand stitching the binding closed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2009, more names {{had been}} {{submitted}} for engraving than could be accommodated on the original wall. In light of this, the Town of Tonawanda chose to initiate a second phase of construction to expand the memorial. That expansion {{took the form of}} a semicircular wall surrounding <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing memorial, adding space for up to 2,500 additional names across 30 new granite plaques. Construction began in the spring of 2010 with workers carefully orchestrating the installation of the new wall around existing memorial fixtures.|$|E
25|$|During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves {{come from}} a northeasterly direction; toward the {{normally}} sheltered side of Catalina Island. Protected harbors such as Avalon and Two Harbors are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.|$|E

25|$|The fur of the Iriomote cat {{is mostly}} dark gray and light brown, with lighter {{hair on the}} belly and insides of the limbs. Hair along the jaw is white. There are two dark brown spots on each cheek. There are 5–7 stripes {{spanning}} from the forehead {{to the back of}} the head, but, unlike the leopard cat, the stripes stop before reaching the shoulders. Dark brown spots cover the sides of the body, and there are 3–4 bands of irregular stripes on the chest. The tail is dark brown; darker spots pattern <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail while the underside of the tail is solid. The tip of the tail is dark.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, the Robbins Company {{took over}} production. They {{produced}} six distinct variants, all in sterling silver. The first 1920 version {{was similar to}} the Dieges & Clust design, but with smaller scroll lettering and the standard single knot. The second 1920 version has more distinctive feathering on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pendant. The engraving on the 1930 version is especially fine. In 1933, BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia, including the medal. In 1955 the obverse of the eagle pendant was made flat so it could be engraved. BSA was added back to the front and the reverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1969.|$|E
25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tapered rollers. This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

500|$|D'Estaing's plan {{of attack}} called for three columns to attack <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortifications with bayonets, while a small fourth {{detachment}} made a demonstration from a location where the British might more reasonably expect an attack, in other words a decoy or distraction. On the evening of July 3rd these formations moved out. The columns, each numbering 300 men, were led by Arthur Dillon, his brother Édouard, and the comte de Noailles. Arthur Dillon's column was [...] accompanied by an advance guard of 180 under the comte de Durat, and the demonstration force numbered just 200. At 4:00 am on the 4th the demonstration force opened fire, while the other three columns charged up Hospital Hill. The British defenders panicked and most fled {{down the hill to}} the apparent safety of Fort George.|$|E
500|$|Cloud Gate was {{originally}} estimated to weigh [...] {{because it was}} impossible to estimate the thickness of the steel compatible with the desired aesthetics. The final piece, however, weighs [...] and care had to be taken in supporting it. [...] The roof of the Park Grill, upon which Cloud Gate sits, had to be strong enough to bear the weight. A large retaining wall separating Chicago's Metra train tracks from the North Grant Park garage travels along <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant and supports much of the sculpture's weight. This wall, {{along with the rest of}} the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected. [...] In June 2004, when construction of the shell began, a large tent (pictured left) was erected around the piece in order to shield it from public view.|$|E
