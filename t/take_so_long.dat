5|$|The {{result was}} {{increased}} water flow in Kitchen Creek, {{which has been}} cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek still does. The increased basin size means that Kitchen Creek in the glens is too steep for its present amount of water flow. As Kitchen Creek continues to cut into the rock and erode it up the Allegheny Front, the creek's slope will decrease and become less steep. In the future, the creek's flow and slope are predicted to become {{similar to those of}} other nearby creeks with similar size drainage basins. This process could <b>take</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that a new glacial period might occur before the transformation is complete.|$|E

[...] When asked when the sequel would get made, he replied: [...] "I <b>take</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> to get around to making a movie that I don’t know when it starts." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1935, Le Mesurier {{was hired}} by the Oldham {{repertory}} company, based at the Coliseum Theatre; his first appearance with them was in a version of the Wilson Collison play, Up in Mabel's Room; he was sacked after one week for missing a performance after oversleeping. In September 1935, he moved to the Sheffield Repertory Theatre to appear in Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary, and also played Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Le Mesurier later commented on the slow progress of his career: [...] "had I known it was going to <b>take</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> I might well have given the whole thing up". In 1937 he joined the Croydon Repertory Theatre, where he appeared in nine productions in 1936 and 1937. During this period Le Mesurier changed his professional name from John Halliley to John Le Mesurier; his biographer Graham McCann observes that [...] "he never bothered, at least in public, to explain the reason for his decision". Le Mesurier used his new name {{for the first time in}} the September 1937 production of Love on the Dole.|$|E

A second reason it <b>took</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> wrote Vern, [...] "was a somewhat belated decision to focus his book on a survivor of the grisly Hi-Fi Shop murders {{rather than on the}} convicted killers." ...|$|R

Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures, which is allowed by US Navy uniform regulations.|$|E
2500|$|The Ardennes was {{considered}} to be easily defended and in 1927, the Guillaumat Commission concluded that the few narrow serpentine roads, through wooded hills could be blocked easily with felled trees, minefields and roadblocks. The swift advance of a large force, particularly a road-bound one, through natural and artificial obstacles, could be easily made slow and arduous. Once an invader managed to get through the Ardennes, the depth and width of the river Meuse made it a considerable obstacle. The resources and equipment needed to use the Ardennes route would <b>take</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> that the French army expected to have ample time to reinforce the area. { ...|$|E
