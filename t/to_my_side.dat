500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it." [...] Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: [...] "I got no choice. All I can do is stick <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 Florida Gators {{featured}} All-American {{defensive end}} Jack Youngblood, {{and he pulled}} {{off one of the}} most remarkable plays in Florida football history. [...] With Bulldogs leading 17–10 and in possession of the ball at the Gators' two-yard line, Youngblood stood up Georgia back Ricky Lake short of the goal, forced a fumble and fell on the football. [...] "They ran a lead play <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> and I cut it off", Youngblood said. [...] "I'm standing there holding the ballcarrier and I take the ball away from him, and gave it back to our offense." [...] Gators quarterback John Reaves and wide receiver Carlos Alvarez then connected for two touchdown passes in the final 5:13 to rally the Florida Gators to a 24–17 victory.|$|E
2500|$|Lu Shi (逯式), the Administrator (太守) of the Wei-controlled Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡), {{often led}} {{his men to}} cause trouble at the border between Wu and Wei. When Lu Xun heard that Lu Shi could not get along with Wen Xiu (文休), a son of the veteran Wei general Wen Ping, {{he came up with}} a plan to stop Lu Shi. He pretended to have {{received}} a letter from Lu Shi and wrote a [...] "reply" [...] as such: [...] "I can sense your sincerity and sorrow when you told me you have disagreements with Wen Xiu. You said both of you cannot exist together and you intend to defect <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b> I have delivered your letter to my lord and will gather my men to welcome you. You should make preparations soon and inform us of the date of your defection." [...] He then left the [...] "reply" [...] letter at the border, where it was picked up by Lu Shi's men. When Lu Shi heard about it, he became afraid and immediately sent his family to the Wei capital Luoyang. His subordinates became distrustful of him and eventually he was dismissed from office.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} {{still for}} a time in the dark--silent; almost invisible. All at once he pinned <b>my</b> elbows <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides.</b> I felt utterly powerless in his grip, and his voice, whispering in my ear, vibrated.|$|R
60|$|Unable {{longer to}} control myself, I sprang <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>side.</b> I caught his arm.|$|R
60|$|I took my {{leave of}} the manager and {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own <b>side</b> of the hotel.|$|R
60|$|I {{shouted to}} Delcarte and Taylor, who came running <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|The shaman {{advanced}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> {{and asked}} me courteously how I fared.|$|E
60|$|The great Thark's long-sword {{leaped from}} its scabbard; Thuvia shrank shuddering <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{had some}} {{difficulty}} in shoving through the crowd; I {{can still remember}} very vividly being jammed at one time between two big men so that my arms were pinned <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides,</b> but all the other details are gone {{out of my mind}} until I found myself almost violently projected forward into the [...] "scrap." ...|$|R
60|$|I stifled a groan, {{and let my}} arms fall limply <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides.</b> I was a weakling and contemptible. I {{realized}} it. And yet to-day when I {{look back}} I see how vast a strength I should have needed. I was but thirteen and of a spirit that had been cowed by her, and was held under her thrall.|$|R
60|$|This was defeat, utter and pitiful. His {{tone was}} too confident, {{he was too}} sure of his ground to leave me a doubt as to what would befall if I made appeal to his knavish followers. <b>My</b> arms fell <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides,</b> and I looked at Gervasio. His face was haggard, {{and his eyes were}} very full of sorrow as they rested on me.|$|R
60|$|Again Kitty looked surprised, a {{very little}} startled, and again she pressed <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|She tripped a step as {{we turned}} the corner, and came closer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|Very softly {{he closed}} the door; softly, yet painfully, he hobbled forward <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Not {{only were}} my arms pulled close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sides,</b> but the {{pressure}} on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand, sometimes a strong man's breast, was set against <b>my</b> mouth <b>to</b> deaden <b>my</b> cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. [...] "And now," [...] said the suppressed voice with another oath, [...] "call out again, and I'll make short work of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|Finding that I {{had nothing}} <b>to</b> say on <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> Mrs. Fosdyke {{looked at her}} watch, and remembered her {{domestic}} duties. <b>To</b> <b>my</b> relief, our interview came to an end.|$|R
60|$|KIT. And now, sir, {{now that}} you have spoken, I claim the liberty <b>to</b> speak on <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! that shews you're a--I mean, d'ye see, {{that the}} {{difficulty}} lies here, my elbows are lashed so fast <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side</b> that I can't {{use them to}} prop me up, but if Poopy will roll down the hill <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> and shove her pretty shoulder under my back when I raise it, perhaps I may succeed in getting up. What say you, Kickup?" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of my voice he got hastily from his chair and hurried <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{believed}} I could. I {{drew the}} wife {{who had so}} long loved me, closer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|That's how I came to lose Ann. At {{intervals}} {{during her}} remarks I tried <b>to</b> put <b>my</b> <b>side</b> of the case, {{but it was}} no good. She wouldn't listen. And presently something seemed to tell me that now was the time <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room and pack. Half an hour later I slid silently into the night.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Capitol Mix" [...] {{uses the}} sample [...] "I want <b>to</b> tell you <b>my</b> <b>side</b> of the case" [...] from the Checkers speech by Richard Nixon.|$|R
60|$|The {{reader will}} be assured that, after {{receiving}} the startling communication of Mary Warren, I did not stop to discuss all these matters with her. My first impulse was to desire her {{to run to the}} beech, and bid Manytongues join me, but she refused <b>to</b> quit <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
60|$|Be rose unsteadily {{and left}} the room. Hardly had he gone before his wife hurried <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|De Cartienne moved round <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> with nervously {{twitching}} {{lips and}} an ugly light in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. Then Mabane, who {{had been}} filling his pipe, came over <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|The laugh put heart into me, but I {{still held}} the bridle with an ensanguined hand close beside the little smeared one; and so, {{followed}} by as fine an escort as a princess could desire, we came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> door <b>side</b> by side.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look exactly}} {{like some of}} the old {{engravings}} of Mohawk princesses," [...] cried Curtis. [...] "Now you are ready <b>to</b> sit by <b>my</b> <b>side</b> and review the procession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be a silly little fool," [...] he {{answered}} good-humouredly. [...] "All I want from you is <b>to</b> sit by <b>my</b> <b>side</b> and talk, {{and tell me}} what to order." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt little Kitty {{pressing}} closer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> {{as if she}} {{had certain}} misgivings touching her other neighbour.|$|E
60|$|A {{disturbing}} picture, {{you will}} admit. It {{was with a}} rather imperious gesture that I summoned Jeeves <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} I was spellbound; then I gave a wild cry that brought all the sailors <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Marie was {{the first}} to {{perceive}} that I had come to life again. Shaking herself free from the clasp of the young man, she staggered towards me and fell upon her knees at <b>my</b> <b>side,</b> muttering words that I could not catch, for they choked in her throat. Then Hans took in the situation, and wriggling his unpleasant self <b>to</b> <b>my</b> other <b>side,</b> lifted <b>my</b> hand and kissed it. Next my father spoke, saying: ...|$|R
6000|$|To Henry's astonishment, Agnes stopped her. 'Wait a moment, Lady Montbarry. I have {{something}} <b>to</b> ask on <b>my</b> <b>side.</b> You have spoken of Ferrari. I wish {{to speak of}} him too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Pickwick,' said Mrs. Leo Hunter, 'I {{must make}} you promise not <b>to</b> stir from <b>my</b> <b>side</b> the whole day. There are {{hundreds}} of people here, that I must positively introduce you to.' ...|$|R
