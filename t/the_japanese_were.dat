5|$|With the Americans {{moving closer}} towards Kiska and Attu, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> finding it {{increasingly}} difficult to resupply their bases there. In March 1943, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid established a naval blockade around the islands, refusing to let Japanese ships through. On March 26, Admiral Hosogaya attempted to break the blockade with eight battle ships as well as three transports, resulting in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, the last battle fought only between surface ships in the Pacific War. Following the American victory in this battle, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> forced to resupply their occupied possessions in the Aleutian chain by submarine.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese Army's {{attack on}} the Allied Lunga {{perimeter}} was decisively defeated in this battle, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> {{not yet ready to}} give up the struggle for Guadalcanal. The Japanese Army and navy made immediate plans to move the rest of the 38th Division to the island, along with the 51st Infantry Division, to try a further offensive against Henderson Field in November 1942.|$|E
5|$|At {{a cost of}} one {{destroyer}} sunk {{and three}} damaged, the Japanese evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. 600 of those died during the evacuation, and 3,000 more required extensive hospital care. On 9 February, Allied forces realized that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> gone and declared Guadalcanal secure, ending the six-month campaign {{for control of the}} island.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{conduct an}} {{analysis}} of consumption and saving behavior in Japan, looking both at trends over time and comparisons with the other industrialized countries. I find {{that some of the}} conventional wisdoms (that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> asset-rich and hold conservative portfolios) still hold but that others (that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> high savers and shun borrowing) no longer hold and that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> not unique, with the United States and the other Anglo-Saxon countries being the true exceptions in many respects. ...|$|R
50|$|A 2008 study about {{genome-wide}} SNPs of East Asians by Chao Tian et al. {{reported that}} Japanese, Koreans and Han Chinese are genetically distinguishable from southeast Asians, and that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> related to Koreans, {{who are more}} closely related to Han Chinese. However, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> relatively genetically distant from Han Chinese, compared to Koreans.|$|R

5|$|Believing that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> {{beginning}} a major offensive {{in the southern}} Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five task forces. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.|$|E
5|$|During the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon against Japanese troops. Despite their defensive advantage {{and the use of}} arquebus by Japanese soldiers, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> at a severe disadvantage due to their lack of cannon. Throughout the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98), the Ming-Joseon coalition used artillery widely in land and naval battles, including on the turtle ships of Yi Sun-sin.|$|E
5|$|In early November, Vandegrift, {{fearing that}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> {{planning}} {{an assault on}} the Lunga perimeter from the east using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops attacked and attempted to encircle Shōji's men at Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere in the Koli Point area.|$|E

5|$|In the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon to bombard an equally large Japanese army. Despite both forces having similar numbers, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> defeated in one day, due to the Ming advantage in firepower. Throughout the Seven Year War in Korea, the Chinese coalition used artillery widely, in both land and naval battles.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> unable to match.|$|E

50|$|The short {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on physical peculiarities to imply racial inferiority. The preeminent danger is positioned to be treachery and not military might. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> distinctively othered as physically deformed. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>are</b> characterized as single-minded, subservient to their superiors, and gullible. The gag with the ice cream-seeking soldiers makes use of the American perception of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> as both gullible and greedy. Bugs' stereotypical portrayal of Japanese womanhood renders him a meek and seductive creature, speaking in a falsetto voice.|$|R
6000|$|The {{most admired}} quality to-day of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>is</b> his patriotism. <b>The</b> Western {{world is in}} rhapsodies over it, unwittingly {{measuring}} <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> patriotism by its own conceptions of patriotism. [...] "For God, my country, and the Czar!" [...] cries the Russian patriot; but in <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> mind there <b>is</b> no differentiation between the three. The Emperor is the Emperor, and God and country as well. The patriotism of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>is</b> blind and unswerving loyalty to what is practically an absolutism. The Emperor can do no wrong, nor can the five ambitious great men who have his ear and control the destiny of Japan.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that day and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> on the verge of breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they {{would have been able to}} isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
50|$|As the {{violence}} unfolded, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> legation <b>was</b> destroyed by rioters. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> diplomats <b>were</b> {{forced to flee}} the country.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} for the Paiwan was about 30, and that for <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>was</b> 543 (12 <b>Japanese</b> soldiers <b>were</b> killed in battle and 531 by disease).|$|R

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942, Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second {{consecutive}} year and also finished the season as the League's top point-scorer. Lindwall and his brother Jack, who played on the wing, scored all of the team's points in the grand final, Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals. However they were denied by a last-minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury-Bankstown 11–9. All the while, <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> inching ever closer to Australia. Malaya had fallen and the northern Australian city of Darwin had been the subject of Japanese air raids.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} {{blockade}} or bottle up the Russian squadron at Port Arthur by sinking blockships in the harbor's channel, the Japanese under Admiral Togo formulated a new plan. Ships were to mine the entrance from {{the harbor and}} then lure the Russians into the minefield {{in the hopes of}} sinking a number of Russian warships. Under cover of four detachments of torpedo boat destroyers, the minelayer Koru-Maru began to lay mines near the entrance to Port Arthur on the night of 31 March. <b>The</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> observed by Admiral Makarov, who believed that they were Russian destroyers whom he had ordered to patrol that area.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} {{concerned}} by {{reports of the}} invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island {{that had already been}} evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E
5000|$|Philip Towle {{from the}} University of Cambridge, who specialises in the {{treatment}} of POWs, awarded the film three stars out of five for historical accuracy.

5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of a}} large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February 1944, the 37th Battalion, {{as part of}} 14th Brigade, was {{involved}} in the Battle of the Green Islands, codenamed Operation Squarepeg. The aim was to secure an airfield for use in further advances in the Solomon Islands. On 15 February, the battalion was landed on the western side of Nissan Island, largely a coral reef, along with 35th Battalion. The 30th Battalion was landed on {{the eastern side of the}} island; collectively, the landings were the largest amphibious operation mounted by New Zealand forces in the war. Although <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> present on the island, the landing was unopposed. Initially positioned to the north of the island's airstrip, it later moved to the village of Sior. Although <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> reported to be in the south of the island, the battalion still carried out patrols to ensure none were still in their sector. Later in the month, soldiers from the battalion carried out landings on Sau, a small island to the northeast of Nissan Island, to deal with Japanese there. Four were wounded in exchanges of gunfire but this operation effectively ended any meaningful Japanese resistance in the area. With Nissan Island secure by 28 February, the battalion switched to a defensive mode of operations, monitoring for Japanese counterattacks and assisting in the building of the facilities necessary to allow the island to be used for air and sea operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the casualties to his brigade, Porter decided {{to isolate the}} Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days. An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>were</b> no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.|$|E
