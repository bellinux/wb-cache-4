40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the history of <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause, a {{bankruptcy}} provision that included goods in the estate of the bankrupt that were in the 'apparent' possession of the bankrupt, rather than in his <b>ownership.</b> <b>The</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause was enacted in 1624 in order to protect creditors from delusive credit, caused by chattel mortgages that generally took the form of a secret bill of sale. This thesis, after considering the present state of the academic literature on the topic, explores the origin of <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause and <b>the</b> first two centuries of its judicial interpretation. The value of this research is that it establishes that the early interpretation of <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause was more sophisticated than modern scholarship suggests. It shows that from the 18 th century onwards the courts were already acting on commercial needs, balancing the prevention of fraud against the encouragement of trade and credit. After the leading case Ryall v Rolle (1749) <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause was interpreted more extensively, but at the same time, various general exceptions emerged that limited <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause. This resulted in a more sophisticated, and in some respects narrowing, application. This thesis aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a doctrinal general legal narrative of <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause, from its enactment until the point at which it came under attack in the mid 19 th century. Case-law and treatises from between the late 16 th and the early 19 th century have been used to conduct this research. The research outcomes of the thesis show that certain assumptions in modern scholarship based on 19 th century sources on the development of <b>the</b> reputed <b>ownership</b> clause and <b>the</b> floating charge are questionable. </p...|$|R
