40|$|Street layout is {{consistently}} associated with adults' <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors,</b> however factors influencing this association are unclear. We examined associations of street layout with travel behaviors: walking for transport (WT) and car use; and, {{the extent to}} which these relationships may be accounted for by availability of local destinations. A 24 -h travel diary was completed in 2009 by 16, 345 adult participants of the South-East Queensland Household Travel Survey, Australia. Three travel-behavior outcomes were derived: any home-based WT; over 30 min of home-based WT; and, over 60 min of car use. For street layout, a space syntax measure of integration was calculated for each Statistical Area 1 (SA 1, the smallest geographic unit in Australia). An objective measure of availability of destinations – Walk Score – was also derived for each SA 1. Logistic regression examined associations of street layout with <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Mediation analyses examined to what extent availability of destinations explained the associations. Street integration was significantly associated with <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Each one-decile increment in street integration was associated with an 18 % (95 %CI: 1. 15, 1. 21) higher odds of any home-based WT; a 10 % (95 %CI: 1. 06, 1. 15) higher odds of over 30 min of home-based WT; and a 5 % (95 %CI: 0. 94, 0. 96) lower odds of using a car over 60 min. Local destinations partially mediated the effects of street layout on <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Well-connected street layout contributes to active travel partially through availability of more local destinations. Urban design strategies need to address street layout and destinations to promote active travel among residents...|$|R
40|$|Master of Regional and Community PlanningDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional & Community PlanningBrent ChamberlainGrowing urban {{populations and}} the {{increasing}} prevalence of the millennial generation are profoundly changing personal <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors</b> and patterns. As a result, cities, planners, and developers must understand and act upon the shifting preferences and expectations of these public transit users in order to align costly public transit services with user needs in efficient ways. While public transit systems are becoming an increasingly vital part of urban life, few jurisdictions have considered the need to tailor these systems to millennials – those most likely to incorporate public transit into their daily lives. This paper examines the <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors</b> of University Students engaged in a forced travel intervention caused by a sudden relocation of their work site. The change in work location encouraged {{the use of a}} free public transit system as means of commuting. Longitudinal survey results, taken pre and post-intervention, indicate statistical differences between transit preferences and actual habits related to transit use and other modes of travel. Survey findings suggest that there is a statistically significant difference between the stated willingness and actual <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors</b> of public transit users and of drivers, and that modal shifts can assist in overcoming the attitude/behavior split related to personal travel among millennials...|$|R

The findings suggest motorists can be influenced to extend their stay and select alternative attractions which translate into substantial direct economic impact to the state. State tourism promotion agencies employ various strategies to motivate tourists to spend time and money in their respective states. Currently, most state tourism market-ing efforts focus on advertising to potential visitors tourist attractions and opportunities available throughout their state. In addition, most states, like Iowa, have built welcome centers at state gateways and highly traveled crossroads in the hopes of attracting travelers to visit places within the state (Howard and Gitelson 1989).

We propose a novel Mining Repeat <b>Travel</b> <b>Behaviors</b> Using Stop Regions (MRTBUSR) method. In MRTBUSR, a stop region is a popular region containing {{a certain number of}} close stop points that can be grouped into a cluster.

The {{results indicate that the}} general usage of smartphones for everyday life largely influence the use of the same technology device for travel purposes. Moreover, it is identified that the types of <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors</b> changed are different according to timing when travelers used smartphones to plan their trips.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to throw light on the link between high speed means of {{transportation}} – especially the TGV – and the present-day temporal structures of the society. The first part describes how the industrial time is born of the industrial capitalism and its conceptions of the work. This model changes but is still very topical, regarding certain important aspects of the contemporary socioeconomic structures. Nevertheless, this permanence can’t explain the whole current evolutions. The second part shows how the high speed <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors</b> – considering only professional purposes – reveal also some mains breaks with the model of industrial time. Third part looks into the model of the fragmented time, which would appear gradually surimposed to the industrial time. Finally, the fourth part presents the figures of high speed as an opportunity and high speed as a necessity. This dual reading of the ways to deal with the distance with high speed means of transportation, appears adapted to the double temporal structure which prevails today.

However, {{it should be pointed}} out that {{the available data}} from ICE vehicle users may not be suitable for EV studies, and a careful distinction should be made.

When examining the performance of the network under the PPP strategy, a large number of factors, including the freeway feature, <b>travel</b> modes, <b>travel</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and the evolution mechanism of other travel modes, should be taken into consideration. Hence, it is significant to establish the evolution model of the performance of transport infrastructure.|$|R
