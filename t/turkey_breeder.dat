[...] Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. They said the infected turkeys have suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development. Chile's turkey meat remains safe to eat, they said, and so far there have been no signs of a potentially dangerous mutation. Virus experts are concerned that a more dangerous and easily transmitted strain could emerge if H1N1/09 combines again with avian flu, which at present is far more virulent but much less contagious to humans.

However, the poult require-ment for folacin was influenced by the fola-cin content of the maternal diet. Ferguson et al. (1961) observed no reduction in hatchability of turkey eggs when <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens were fed a purified diet with-out supplemental folacin. Kratzer et al. (1956) reported that the optimum folacin requirement for hatchability of turkey eggs was 0. 7 mg. of folacin per kg. of diet.

40|$|Abstract: Embryo and {{hatchling}} survival diminish as <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens age. Recent {{data indicated}} that a chelated calcium proteinate (CCP) additive given to <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens improved embryo survival as hens aged but did not affect shell thickness. We hypothesized that the mechanism by which this occurred may be by improved functional shell quality and its consequent effect on cardiac physiology. To test the hypothesis, CCP was supplemented to the diet of Large White <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens for a 25 week egg production period and compared with controls without supplementation. Eggshell conductance, conductance constants, poult growth and cardiac physiology were measured at weeks 10, 18 and 25 of production. Because elevated temperatures increase heart rates and reduce heart weight and survival, half of the eggs was incubated at 37. 9 °C whereas the remaining eggs were incubated at 37. 5 °C. Embryos and poults from the CCP group exhibited increased heart weights and improved cardiac health. The hatching poults from CCP-fed hens also grew faster for the first 3 d of life.

40|$|A {{relatively}} new instrument {{known as a}} Sperm Quality Analyzer ® (SQA) offers a rapid assessment of sperm quality and quantity by providing a sperm quality index (SQI). The SQA measures the intensity of sperm activity and motile concentration by determining the number and amplitude of sperm movements per second in a capillary tube as detected through light beam interference. Though tested in humans and chickens, its application for assessing semen quality in <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> had not been previously evaluated. Our in vitro {{results showed that the}} SQI generated by the SQA was indicative of turkey sperm concentration, viability, and motility. The SQA detected the decline in sperm quality that occurred with prolonged storage of semen as well as age-related changes during a semen production cycle of a flock of <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders.</b> ^ The effect of antioxidants, ascorbic acid (AA) and L-carnitine, on semen traits of breeder birds was evaluated. Dietary treatments of 0, 75, and 150 mg/kg AA were fed to <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> during the first 4 months of their reproductive cycle and then were doubled to 150 and 300 mg/kg during months 5 to 9. Semen traits were unaffected by dietary AA; however, multinucleated giant cells, indicative of degeneration, were quantitatively detected in the testes of control birds, but were absent from AA-supplemented birds, suggesting that the antioxidant properties of AA may have delayed the formation of these degenerative cells. Feeding 500 mg/kg of dietary carnitine to young (32 to 37 wk of age) and aging (58 to 62 wk of age) White Leghorn roosters for 5 weeks not only improved sperm concentration during the last half of supplementation, but also reduced sperm lipid peroxidation. Testicular tissue was preserved as indicated by a reduction in multinucleated giant cells in the carnitine-fed birds. These results suggest that dietary carnitine has antioxidant properties that may preserve sperm membranes in roosters, thereby extending the life span of sperm. ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{epidemiology}} of thermophilic campylobacters in turkeys {{has been}} scarcely investigated, we carried out longitudinal studies aimed at identifying potential sources and vehicles of Campylobacter infection in commercial meat turkey farms. A preliminary sampling in <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> flocks {{was carried out}} in order to detect a Campylobacter-positive flock. Then, a monitoring of 2 meat turkey farms rearing the progeny of the positive <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> flocks was performed. Meconium was collected from day-old chicks at the hatchery and then faecal swabs were collected three times at the farm (at the beginning, middle and end of the production cycle). Farm sampling consisted of multiple drinking water samples, surface swabs, air, overshoe samples in the anteroom and inside the house, and insects. Sampling was also carried out during downtime. Isolation and identification of Campylobacter spp. were performed by a conventional culture method and a multiplex end-point PCR assay, respectively. Day-old chicks tested negative for thermophilic campylobacters, whereas C. jejuni and C. coli were subsequently isolated from birds throughout the entire cycle in all flocks except for one. Both Campylobacter species were also frequently isolated from drinkers, flies and lesser mealworms. Water, air from inside the house, and surface swabs were always negative. These findings suggest that vertical transmission could not be an important source of flock infection, whereas horizontal transmission should be considered the major route for colonization of turkeys, as campylobacters were found in several environmental sources...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Photorefractoriness (PR) in the <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hen is {{characterized}} by a lack of responsiveness to photoperiods that previously induced or maintained egg production. The consequence of PR is spontaneous regression of ovarian function and cessation of lay. Photo-sensitivity (PS) may be regained by giving at least 8 wk of short photoperiod (8 L: 16 D) (light restriction). Follow-ing the transition from PR to PS, the birds may be photo-stimulated with long photoperiods, which allows for the recrudescence of ovarian function and normal egg pro-duction. Although the return of reproductive viability is the parameter for determining the successful recycle of ovarian function, there are no known reports of the physi-ological costs of this transition on immune function in the <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hen. We conducted an experiment to determine the immune responsiveness at various stages of recycle in the <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hen.

40|$|ABSTRACT Supplemental dietary iodine (3. 5 mg/kg) was fed to two {{commercial}} strains [British United Turkeys (B) and Nicholas (N) ] of <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens. The basal diet contained. 7 mg/kg of iodine. Observations {{were made}} on hen body weights, feed consumption, hatchability, egg weights, and egg functional characteristics {{to test the hypothesis}} that there are differences between commercial strains of <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens in the dietary iodine requirement for reproductive success. Supplemental iodine decreased (PS. 05) functional egg characteristics of both strains. Egg production and hatchability were influenced by an interaction between strains and dietary iodine (K. 05). In Strain B hens, egg production and hatchability declined (P<. 05) when hens were fed supplemental iodine but in Strain N hens no effects on hatchability were observed and egg production increased (P<. 05) with iodine supplementation. The decline in hatchability of eggs from Strain B hens was due to significant (P<. 05) increases in embryonic mortality during the 1 st wk of incubation and during pipping. The treatments resulting in depressed hatchability caused embryos to rely more (P£. 05) on glycogenosis than gluconeogenesis during pipping and hatching. The Strain B embryos utilized gluconeogenesis more during pipping (PS. 05) than Strain N embryos and embryos from Strain B iodine-fed hens had a lower rate of gluconeogenesis than those from hens not fed iodine.

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} with Nicholas parent-stock <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens {{was designed to}} determine the effects of feed restnction during the rearing period and age at photostimulation on reproductive performance. Hens reared on ad libitum intake of conventional corn-soybean diets (ad libitum), skip- 1 -day per week (skip- 1 -day), and 95 % of ad libitum (95 %) were placed into cages and photostimulated when they reached a target body weight of 10 kg or at the conventional age of 29 wk. A 3 x 2 factorial design was used, with five replicates of three hens for each treatment. All birds were fed for ad libitum access during the breeding period. More eggs were set from 95 % birds than from ad libitum or skip- 1 -day birds (P< 05); there was no difference between ad libitum and skip- 1 -day birds. Photostimnlafing based on 10 kg of BW versus 29 wk of age had no effect on total eggs set. There was no effect of rearing feed restriction on fertility or hatchability. Photostimulating based on 10 kg rather than 29 wk of age reduced fertility and hatchability (P< 05). The results of this study indicate that optimum reproductive performance is attained by restricting the feed consumption of <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens to 95 % of ad libitum during the rearing period. No benefits were gained from photostimulating at 10 kg of BW versus 29 wk of age. (Key words: feed restriction, photostimulation, age, reproduction, <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> hens...|$|E
40|$|Prevention, {{control and}} {{eradication}} are three different goals or outcomes {{for dealing with}} avian influenza (AI) outbreaks in commercial poultry of the USA. These goals are achieved through various strategies developed using components of biosecurity (prevention or reduction in exposure), surveillance and diagnostics, elimination of infected poultry, decreasing host susceptibility to the virus (vaccination or host genetics) and education. However, {{the success of any}} developed strategy has depended on industry–government trust, co-operation and interaction. The preferred outcome for HPAI has been stamping out, for which the federal government has regulatory authority to declare an emergency and do immediate eradication of HPAI, and pay indemnities. For H 5 and H 7 LPAI, strategies vary from an immediate control plan followed by an intermediate to long-term strategy of eradication. The state governments have regulatory authority over H 5 and H 7 LPAI, but work cooperatively with USDA in joint programmes. Stamping out has been occasionally used as has controlled marketing, but inconsistently, indemnities have been funded by the state governments and the poultry industries, and less frequently by USDA.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two 20 -week {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of 0. 99, 1. 77, 2. 55 and 3. 33 percent calcium, 0. 64 and 0. 82 percent total phosphorus and 0 and 0. 25 percent Nopgro in diets of <b>breeder</b> <b>turkeys</b> on egg production, fertility, hatchability, egg weight, shell thickness and calcium content of blood serum. Each experiment contained 272 female and 32 male Beltsville White turkeys. Turkeys fed diets containing the lowest level of calcium produced significantly fewer eggs, lower hatchability of fertile eggs and of all eggs set, lower shell weight as percentage of egg weight, thinner egg shells and less egg shell color. Varying the phosphorus level in the diets as indicated above and adding a commercial fermentation product, Nopgro, which is a blend of dried residues produced from Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus subtilis grown on a wheat "bran base, to the diets failed to influence these measurements, except for an increased shell thickness in one experiment from the added phosphorus. Based upon a review of the literature and data collected in this study, the calcium requirement of <b>breeder</b> <b>turkey</b> hens is in excess of 2. 0 percent and perhaps as much as 2. 5 percent to obtain optimum egg production, and levels of calcium in excess of 2. 5 percent are believed not detrimental to hatchability.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of the present experiment was to feed triio-dothyronine (T 3) to lines of <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> selected for egg production and growth, and an unselected control line. The data were collected to determine a genetic basis for thyroid-mediated maternal effects on embryonic physiology and livability. At 30 wk of age, turkeys of the three lines were photostimulated and half of each line was fed a diet containing. 5 ppm T 3. Maternal dietary T 3 increased egg weight, reduced yolk solids and eggshell conductance constants, and increased albumen solids and water in eggs in all lines compared with control eggs. Hatchability in all lines was not affected by the dietary treatment (Control = 72. 2 %; T 3 treatment = 70. 7 %), {{but there was a}} significant interaction between dietary T 3 and line of turkey for the time of embryonic mortality, time of hatching, and carbohydrate metabolism of the embryo. The T 3 increased mortality of the Egg line and unselected line during pipping, increased mortality of the Growth line in the plateau stage, but decreased its mortality during internal pipping. Reduced glycogen in liver as well as a reduced gluconeogenesis were evident in embryos of the two selected lines fed T 3. It is concluded that genetic lines may have different metabolic patterns based on their genetic constitution in order to compensate for variations in egg solids and eggshell conductance constants. The metabolic patterns are reflected in differ-ent levels of embryonic blood plasma glucose, glycogen, and gluconeogenesis.

40|$|Abstract Background The turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is an {{important}} agricultural species that is the second largest contributor to the world's poultry meat production. The genomic resources of <b>turkey</b> provide <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> with tools needed for the genetic improvement of commercial breeds of turkey for economically important traits. A linkage map of turkey is essential {{not only for the}} mapping of quantitative trait loci, but also as a framework to enable the assignment of sequence contigs to specific chromosomes. Comparative genomics with chicken provides insight into mechanisms of genome evolution and helps in identifying rare genomic events such as genomic rearrangements and duplications/deletions. Results Eighteen full sib families, comprising 1008 (35 F 1 and 973 F 2) birds, were genotyped for 775 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Of the 775 SNPs, 570 were informative and used to construct a linkage map in turkey. The final map contains 531 markers in 28 linkage groups. The total genetic distance covered by these linkage groups is 2, 324 centimorgans (cM) with the largest linkage group (81 loci) measuring 326 cM. Average marker interval for all markers across the 28 linkage groups is 4. 6 cM. Comparative mapping of turkey and chicken revealed two inter-, and 57 intrachromosomal rearrangements between these two species. Conclusion Our turkey genetic map of 531 markers reveals a genome length of 2, 324 cM. Our linkage map provides an improvement of previously published maps because of the more even distribution of the markers and because the map is completely based on SNP markers enabling easier and faster genotyping assays than the microsatellitemarkers used in previous linkage maps. Turkey and chicken are shown to have a highly conserved genomic structure with a relatively low number of inter-, and intrachromosomal rearrangements. </p...|$|R
40|$|Disease control {{measures}} require poultry {{to be killed}} on farms to minimise the risk of disease being transmitted to other poultry, {{and in some cases}} to protect public health. High expansion gas-filled foam has been shown to have potential as a possible for humane emergency killing of poultry. It may also have potential for other applications where there are concerns over welfare, e. g. killing laying hens in a poultry shed at the end of lay. This project will assess the welfare implications for individual birds of application of anoxic (nitrogen filled) gas-foam. Appuratus capable of delivering gas filled foam of the correct specification will be developed and incorporated into a pilot testing appuratus. Measurement of key physiological parameters during the application of anoxic gas-foam (versus air control) will allow inferences to be drawn about time to loss of consciousness, time to non-recovery, cause of death and potential welfare insults experienced by birds during the euthansia process. The project will also include development work to scale up exisiting foam generators to delivery rates suitable for large poultry houses with the ultimate aim of producing reliable implementation protocols. The project will be undertaken in collaboration with complementary research in The USA and the Netherlands. In brief, we will undertake one common experiment using nitrogen gas-filled foam with chickens, ducks and turkeys using common methods. This will ensure that the results are directly comparable between the major species of poultry, avoid duplication of effort and provide the basis of internationally agreed methods of humane killing of poultry, during a disease epidemic or for spent laying hens, broiler and <b>turkey</b> <b>breeders</b> at the end of lay. The findings of this project will be presented to the British poultry industry, Government officials, Animal Health, welfare NGOs and poultry veterinarians.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe two clinical cases of toxicosis by accidental administration of salinomycin in feed in broiler <b>breeders</b> and <b>turkeys.</b> In the first clinical case, a 32000 broiler breeders flock, 30 weeks of age, suffered a severe mortality during the first week, a sharp decrease in egg production and a dramatic reduction in food consumption together with an increase of eating time. The pathological condition manifested itself mainly with leg paralysis and reluctance to move. In necropsy, signs of bile hyper-secretion, absence of feed in the digestive tract, liver degeneration, egg peritonitis, enlarged kidneys and spleen atrophy were found. Serological examinations for IBV, IBD, NDV, Mg, Ms, Ort, TRT, AE and CAA were negative. The broiler breeders flock was finally euthanized due to an irreversible condition, slow recovery and poor production indicators. In the second clinical case, a flock of 27000 turkeys fatteners, aged from 20 to 35 days, showed an increased daily mortality up to 10 and a 88 % total death loss in 2 weeks period. The turkeys showed great growth retardation, reluctance to move and eat, ataxia and absence of gross lesions, except atrophy of the spleen and pica. Serological examinations for NDV and AI were negative. After removal and change of feed, the remaining flock recovered normally. These two clinical cases were initially associated with incorrect diet and, after obtaining detailed clinical history, laboratory tests and food analysis, the by error administration of salinomycin in feed was confirmed.

40|$|Experiments {{designed}} {{to investigate the}} effect of dietary nutrient concentrations on the growth and development of pullets are relatively long term and expensive to conduct. As the cost of research increases, mathematical models become valuable tools to answer research and development questions. Modeling growth curves allows nutritionists and poultry researchers to predict dynamic or daily nutrient needs more adequately than using fixed requirements. The potential and validity of a specially reparameterized monomolecular model to partition nutrient intakes between requirements for maintenance and growth was previously demonstrated in relation to ruminants, pigs, chickens, <b>turkeys,</b> and broiler <b>breeder</b> pullets. In the current study, the model was evaluated {{for its ability to}} estimate ME and CP requirements for maintenance and growth in egg-type pullets. On the basis of the results of this study, along with those previously reported for chickens, <b>turkeys,</b> and broiler <b>breeder</b> pullets, this model is advantageous because it can predict the magnitude and direction of responses of growing poultry to dietary ME and CP intakes without requiring initial assumptions. The model also has the advantage of biological interpretability of the parameter estimates. One of the main consequences of this interpretability is that the results from several experiments can be pooled to obtain the best estimates of the response coefficients. © 2012 Poultry Science Association, Inc...|$|R

It was concluded that exposure of breeder turkey hens to FS fluorescent light in closed confine-ment results in reproductive performance similar to that obtained with incandescent lighting. (Key words. - reproductive performance, turkeys, fluorescent light...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Previous {{research}} has shown that a line (F) of turkeys selected long-term for increased 16 -wk body weight was more susceptible to challenge with washed Pasteurella multocida than a randombred control line (RBC 2), the base population of F. A previous study also indicated that the mortality of the F line following chal-lenge with P. multocida was similar to that of sire lines from two of the three major primary breeders. The pur-pose {{of the present study was}} to compare the resistance of the sire line from the third major primary <b>turkey</b> <b>breeder</b> (C) not previously studied with that of the F and RBC 2 lines to determine whether there is variation in resistance among the sire lines from the three major pri-mary breeders. The sire lines from all three primar...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} that upon the sultans' request a special breed of pigeon was bred in the Manisa Palace. (Manisa is an old Ottoman city in western <b>Turkey).</b> The pigeon <b>breeders</b> of the sultan {{developed}} this unique breed of pigeon. For centuries the breed was kept away from the common people. This {{is one of the}} reasons why Hünkari is still known as the bird of the sultans in its homeland. The white spots on the tail is called [...] "the seal of the Sultan". That's why it is an important feature in the standard of the Satinettes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Eggs were {{obtained}} from two commercial Small White <b>turkey</b> broiler <b>breeder</b> flocks. One was 55 weeks old and had exhibited "good " production, fertility, and hatchability while the other was 48 weeks of age and "poor " in all respects. Heavy, medium heavy, medium light, and light egg weight categories were formed by source then incubated together. A sample of poults from each egg weight category were recombined in the same proportions as obtained from the egg population and grown in floor pens that separated breeder sources and sexes. Management and feed were common to all treatments. Poult growth and feed efficiency through 14 weeks of age were unaffected by parent pro-ductivity. Body weight at placement was influenced by egg weight, but this effect disappeared prior to marketing. Total mortality, carcass dressing yield, and percentage "A " grades were un-affected by both variables, respectively of sex. Failure to alter any of the parameters measured was attributed to particularly favorable production circumstances. (Key words: turkey production, egg incubation...|$|R
40|$|One hundred fifty-three {{isolates}} of Pasteurella multocida, {{representing the}} causative agent of 95 % of all known outbreaks of fowl cholera occurring in California meat and <b>breeder</b> <b>turkeys</b> from August 1985 through February 1987, were examined for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Of the 153 isolates, 6 {{were shown to}} be resistant {{to one or more}} antimicrobial agents. Of the six resistant isolates, five contained R plasmids. All but one of the R plasmids were small (6 to 7 megadaltons) and nonconjugative, encoding resistance to tetracycline or kanamycin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides; the other was large (70 megadaltons) and conjugative, transferring resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline to P. multocida and Escherichia coli. The three plasmids encoding resistance to tetracycline alone appeared identical...|$|R
