5000|$|Air {{traffic control}} units {{use the term}} [...] "squawk" [...] when they are {{assigning}} an aircraft a <b>transponder</b> <b>code,</b> e.g., [...] "Squawk 7421". Squawk thus {{can be said to}} mean [...] "select transponder code" [...] or [...] "squawking" [...] to mean [...] "I have selected <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> xxxx".|$|R
50|$|<b>Transponder</b> <b>codes</b> {{are four}} digit numbers {{transmitted}} by the transponder in an aircraft {{in response to}} a secondary surveillance radar interrogation signal to assist air traffic controllers in traffic separation. A discrete <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> (often called a squawk code) is assigned by air traffic controllers to uniquely identify an aircraft. This allows easy identification of aircraft on radar.|$|R

Standard is a five-speed manual gearbox, with the CVT auto an optional extra.|$|R
50|$|The {{civilian}} aircraft {{emergency frequency}} for voice distress alerting is 121.5 MHz. Military aircraft use 243 MHz (which is a harmonic of 121.5 MHz, and therefore civilian beacons transmit on this frequency as well). Aircraft can also signal an emergency by setting {{one of several}} special <b>transponder</b> <b>codes,</b> such as 7700.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{automation}} systems {{know the}} details of the aircraft it is tracking, this information is available on the display, as part of the datablock near the aircraft representation.

50|$|<b>Transponder,</b> the <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> {{that must}} be set for the {{aircraft}} prior to departure and during the flight. T also stands for time, as in void time, if one is issued. A void time is an expiration time, meaning, the IFR clearance is voided if the aircraft is not airborne by the void time.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{transponder}} {{receives an}} interrogation request it broadcasts the configured <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> (or [...] "squawk code"). This {{is referred to}} as [...] "Mode 3A" [...] or more commonly, Mode A.

50|$|IFR {{flights in}} {{controlled}} airspace require an ATC clearance for {{each part of}} the flight. A clearance always specifies a clearance limit, which is the farthest the aircraft can fly without a new clearance. In addition, a clearance typically provides a heading or route to follow, altitude, and communication parameters, such as frequencies and <b>transponder</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} fly within the DC SFRA, pilots of general {{aviation}} aircraft {{are required to}} file a special fight rules flight plan, obtain a discrete <b>transponder</b> <b>code,</b> and remain in contact with air traffic control at all times.

50|$|Since the TLS simulates an ILS {{signal that}} is {{specific}} to one aircraft's location, only one aircraft {{at a time}} may be cleared for the TLS landing approach. Any other aircraft in the area will receive the same guidance regardless of their location relative to the approach and must wait to be cleared by ATC. The <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> for the cleared aircraft is selected at the remote control unit.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} Gulf War of 1991, Israel was {{attacked}} by Iraqi Scud missiles. Israeli Air Force pilots were on constant stand-by in their cockpits throughout the conflict, ready to fly to Iraq to retaliate. Diplomatic pressure as well as denial of IFF <b>transponder</b> <b>codes</b> from the United States, however, kept the IAF grounded while Coalition air assets and Patriot missile batteries supplied by the US and the Netherlands sought {{to deal with the}} Scuds.|$|R
50|$|In both systems, {{an antenna}} is {{placed at the}} start, finish, and in some cases, {{intermediate}} time points and is connected to a decoder. This decoder identifies the unique <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> and calculates the exact time when the transponder passes a timing point. Some implementations of timing systems {{require the use of}} a mat on the ground at the timing points while other systems implement the timing points with vertically oriented portals.|$|R

5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|R
50|$|The SmartDeck CCU is {{a smaller}} display screen used for {{entering}} flight plan data, obtaining airport information, and entering nav/com frequencies or <b>transponder</b> <b>codes.</b> SmartDeck {{is the only}} glass cockpit system in the light aircraft market that includes a display dedicated to such functions. Because radio frequencies, flight plan data and airport info can also be manipulated on the MFD, SmartDeck provides a “feature in use” annunciation if the user is accessing or modifying information in two places at once.|$|R
50|$|All systems utilize {{specialized}} software to calculate results and splits. This software usually resides {{on a separate}} PC computer that {{is connected to the}} readers via serial or ethernet communications. The software relates the raw <b>transponder</b> <b>code</b> and timestamp data to each entrant in a database and calculates gun and net times of runners, or the splits of a triathlete. In advanced systems these results are instantly calculated and published to the internet so that athletes and spectators have access to results via any web enabled device.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{short range}} radar used in air traffic control will scan the area about 60 miles every 4-6 seconds. The primary signal {{returned}} will contain a range and azimuth of a target. Automation will correlate these targets scan to scan and make estimates of speed and direction. A secondary signal (Transponder (aviation)) may be available, containing the aircraft <b>transponder</b> <b>code,</b> and possibly altitude (and possibly other information if Mode S). The automation will correlate the primary and secondary signals, and measure horizontal and vertical speed estimates.|$|R
2500|$|The Clipper Maid of the Seas {{approached}} {{the corner of}} the Solway Firth at 19:01 and crossed the coast at 19:02 UTC.
