25|$|The {{end of the}} {{war with}} Iran served to deepen latent {{tensions}} between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor Kuwait. Saddam urged <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaitis</b> to waive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30billion, but they refused.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait {{also ordered}} 14 Lightnings in December 1966, {{comprising}} 12 F.53Ks and two T.55Ks. The first Kuwait aircraft, a T.55K first flew on 24 May 1968 and deliveries to Kuwait started in December 1968. <b>The</b> <b>Kuwaitis</b> somewhat overestimated {{their ability to}} maintain such a complex aircraft, not adopting the extensive support from BAC and Airwork Services that the Saudis used to keep their Lightnings operational, so serviceability was poor. The Kuwaiti Lightnings {{did not have a}} long service career; after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Egypt in 1973, Kuwait replaced its last Lightnings with Dassault Mirage F1s in 1977. The remaining aircraft were stored at Kuwait International Airport, many were subsequently destroyed during the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990.|$|E
25|$|The 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) {{added to}} its combat history during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In August 1990 {{the group was}} called upon to conduct {{operations}} in Southwest Asia {{in response to the}} Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. During this crisis the Army's First Special Operations Task Force consisting of elements of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), comprising 106 special operations teams, performed a wide variety of missions. These spanned a wide scope of operations, including support to coalition warfare; conducting foreign internal defense missions with the Saudi Arabian Army; performing special reconnaissance, border surveillance, direct action, combat search and rescue missions; and advising and assisting a pan-Arab equivalent force larger than six U.S. divisions; as well as conducting civil-military operations training and liaison with <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaitis.</b> The border surveillance mission assigned the 5th Special Forces was key to providing actionable intelligence to the US and Pan-Arab Forces. New military relationships were forged between the US and the Arab dictatorships.|$|E
5000|$|Sheikh Mubarak Abdullah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah (1934-1987) ( [...] الشيخ مبارك عبد الله الجابر الصباح [...] ) was {{a member}} of the House of Sabah and one of <b>the</b> first <b>Kuwaitis</b> to attain <b>the</b> {{military}} rank of lieutenant general. He was one of <b>the</b> first <b>Kuwaitis</b> to be commissioned as an officer by the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, UK, and the first Kuwaiti to receive an Amiri Decree for appointment as Chief of the General Staff (in March 1963, before the age of 30). Mubarak initiated joint training of Kuwait Armed Forces and United States Armed Forces in 1977 and, the following year, was the first military officer to establish conscription.|$|R
5000|$|Kuwait was {{the pioneer}} of {{contemporary}} music in <b>the</b> Gulf. <b>Kuwaitis</b> were <b>the</b> first commercial recording {{artists in the}} Gulf. Nawal El Kuwaiti, Nabeel Shoail, Abdul Kareem Abdul-Qader and Abdallah Al Rowaished are the most prominent modern performers.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> twelve <b>Kuwaitis,</b> {{combined}} in Al Odah v. United States, {{claimed that they}} were in Pakistan and Afghanistan giving humanitarian aid.

500|$|In 2008 Robert Fisk {{obtained}} a report written in September 2002, for Saddam Hussein's [...] "presidency intelligence office," [...] by Iraq's [...] "Special Intelligence Unit M4." [...] The report {{said that the}} Iraqis had been interrogating Abu Nidal in his home as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt, and indirectly for the United States. It {{said he had been}} asked by <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaitis</b> to find links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Just before being moved to a more secure location, Abu Nidal asked to be allowed to change his clothing, went into his bedroom and shot himself, the report said. He was buried on 29 August 2002 in al-Karakh's Islamic cemetery in Baghdad, in a grave marked M7.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, the Kuwait National Assembly took a 60 {{percent stake}} in the equity of KOC with the {{remaining}} 40 percent divided equally between BP and Gulf. <b>The</b> <b>Kuwaitis</b> took over the rest of the equity in 1975, giving them full ownership of KOC. This meant that Gulf (EH) had to start supplying its downstream operations in Europe with crude bought on the world market at commercial prices. The whole GOC(EH) edifice now became highly marginal in an economic sense. Many of the marketing companies that Gulf had established in Europe were never truly viable on a stand-alone basis. [...] In 1976 during the nationalization of Venezuelan oil, the transfer of properties, benefits, equipment [...] of Gulf Oil to PDVSA was carried out without any setback and with full satisfaction on both parts.|$|E

50|$|Abdullah Saleh Al Mulla (died 1955) was Secretary of State in Kuwait {{under the}} Emirs Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and Sheikh Abdullah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah. He {{was one of}} <b>the</b> first <b>Kuwaitis</b> to be educated in Britain during the early 1900s, and the country's first Secretary of State that was able to {{directly}} deal with the Western world during a pivotal period of Kuwait's history, the discovery of oil.|$|R
2500|$|After his arrest, Bales was {{transferred}} out of Afghanistan, stopping at a U.S. {{military base in}} Kuwait. His stop in Kuwait upset the Kuwaiti government as they heard about the Bales case from news reports before hearing from the U.S. government. According to an unnamed official: [...] "When they learned about it, <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaitis</b> blew a gasket and wanted him out of there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, the Defense Intelligence Agency {{received}} {{information from}} a source considered reliable, predicting that [...] "the situation is presently more critical than previously reported" [...] and postulating a 50% chance Iraq would invade Iran. An April 11 CIA analysis is more blunt: [...] "Evidence indicates that Iraq had probably planned to initiate a major military move against Iran {{with the aim of}} toppling the Khomeini regime"—and had [...] "sought to engage <b>the</b> <b>Kuwaitis</b> to act as intermediary in obtaining United States approval and support for Iraqi military action against Iran." [...] Carter himself has confirmed that fear the U.S. hostages would be executed if Iraq attacked was one reason he approved a failed rescue mission on April 24. In light of these alerts, the claims of senior Carter administration officials involved with Iran—including White, Naas, Precht, and head of the National Security Council (NSC)'s Iran desk Gary Sick—that they were surprised by the invasion require some explanation. In all likelihood, these warnings went unheeded because [...] "those who doubted they amounted to compelling evidence won the argument. In effect, they were right. Only in early July did U.S. observers note the movement of Iraqi assets out of garrison with war-related 'basic loads' of ammunition" [...] and it was not until September 17 that the CIA indicated [...] "the intensification of border clashes between Iran and Iraq has reached a point where a serious conflict is now a distinct possibility." [...] Even then, as recounted by State Department official W. Nathaniel Howell, U.S. officials remained unsure what to make of Saddam's intentions: [...] "We all followed Saddam's actions and rhetoric closely but most people I knew tended to believe he was posturing." [...] When the invasion came on September 22, [...] "it was unclear whether Saddam had simply fallen into a rage following a smaller skirmish." [...] White recalled: [...] "The outbreak of war did, in fact, {{come as a surprise to}} most of us because a decent portion of Iraq's ground forces were still in garrison. The hasty movement of the remaining units up to the front immediately after the beginning of major hostilities was the activity that tended to nudge me toward the abrupt scenario in which Saddam ordered the attack before all military preparations had been completed." [...] Thus, in the view of Chris Emery, [...] "it is unlikely that the United States was ever in possession of clear evidence of Saddam's intention to invade Iran. Although the Carter administration drastically underestimated the scale of Saddam's plans, the disorganized and apparently impetuous nature of the invasion, with much of the Iraqi army still in garrison, and occurring in the context of border skirmishes and aggressive propaganda, muddied the waters for U.S. observers." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} sociolinguist phonological change, the {{following}} study investigates the [j] sound in <b>the</b> speech of <b>Kuwaitis</b> as <b>the</b> predominant form and characterizes the sedentary population {{which is made}} up of both the indigenous and non-indigenous group; while [ʤ] is the realisation of the Bedouins who are also a part of the indigenous population. Although [ʤ] is the classical variant, it has, for some time, been regarded by <b>Kuwaitis</b> as <b>the</b> stigmatized form and the [j] as the one that carries prestige. This study examines the change of status of [j] and [ʤ] in <b>the</b> speech of <b>Kuwaitis.</b> <b>The</b> main hypothesis is that [j] no longer carries prestige. To test this hypothesis, 40 Kuwaitis of different gender, ages, educational background, and social networks were spontaneously chosen to be interviewed. Their speech was phonetically transcribed and accordingly was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Results indicate that the [j] variant is undergoing change of status and that the social parameters and the significant political and social changes, that Kuwait has undergone recently, have triggered this linguistic shift...|$|R
50|$|The Kuwait-Najd War {{occurred}} because Ibn Saud wanted to annex Kuwait. Ibn Saud insisted that Kuwait's territory belonged to him.

50|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} that the five {{permanent members of the}} United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States), who are all nuclear powers, have created an exclusive nuclear club whose powers are unchecked. Unlike the General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council does not have true international representation. This has led to accusations that the UNSC only addresses the strategic interests and political motives of the permanent members, especially in humanitarian interventions: for example, protecting <b>the</b> oil-rich <b>Kuwaitis</b> in 1991 but poorly protecting resource-poor Rwandans in 1997.|$|R

50|$|Kuwait's lack {{of support}} for Palestinians after the Gulf War was a {{response}} to the alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein, who had earlier invaded Kuwait. On March 14, 1991, 200,000 Palestinians were still residing in Kuwait, out of initial 400,000. Palestinians began leaving Kuwait during one week in March 1991, following Kuwait's liberation from Iraqi occupation. During a single week in March, the Palestinian population of Kuwait had almost entirely fled <b>the</b> country. <b>Kuwaitis</b> said that Palestinians leaving the country could move to Jordan, since most Palestinians held Jordanian passports.
