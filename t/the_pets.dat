5|$|The series follows Blythe Baxter, a 12 Year {{old girl}} {{living with her}} air pilot father, Roger. Forced to move out from her {{suburban}} hometown following her father's promotion, she moves into an apartment located in a crowded city. Their complex is located above the eponymous Littlest Pet Shop—a pet store that {{also serves as a}} day camp for numerous pets—where Blythe works as a fashion designer. Her adventure begins when she discovers that she alone can miraculously understand and talk to <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> that regularly stay at the shop, in addition to most other animals on the planet. As she and <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> spend time together, they find the pet shop jeopardized by larger pet store managed by Fisher Biskit and his snooty twin daughters, Whittany and Brittany Biskit. To avoid being dispersed, <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> convince Blythe to remain an employee.|$|E

5|$|Littlest Pet Shop is a Canadian–American children's {{animated}} {{television series}} developed by Julie McNally-Cahill and Tim Cahill for Hasbro Studios. Based on the Littlest Pet Shop and Blythe toys owned by Hasbro, the show follows Blythe Baxter, {{a teenage girl}} who, after moving into an apartment in a metropolitan area, gains {{the ability to communicate}} with animals. Located below her apartment is the eponymous pet store where Blythe works and talks to a group of pets who regularly reside at a day care in the shop. Worried that a corrupt rival business will drive their shop out of business, <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> depend on Blythe to drive business into the store with her pet fashion designs.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pet</b> wears a {{lightweight}} collar which emits a warning sound when <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> nears <b>the</b> boundary. If the warning is ignored and <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> crosses beyond <b>the</b> boundary of <b>the</b> fence, <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> receives a mild electric shock from the collar. The stimulus delivered to <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> may be applied more frequently and at greater strength as the animal approaches <b>the</b> boundary. <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> soon learns {{to avoid the}} invisible fence location, making it an effective virtual barrier. Animals (including humans) not wearing the collar are unaffected by the defined boundaries.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Happy <b>Pet</b> {{is similar}} to Bandai's {{previous}} release, the Tamagotchi. Like the Tamagotchi, <b>the</b> Happy <b>Pet</b> is a pixelised creature housed in a computer worn around the wrist. Unlike Tamagotchi, which involves raising imaginary creatures, <b>the</b> Happy <b>Pet</b> involves raising a real-life animal. It operates on a touch screen. The touch screen enables the user to stroke <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> to either praise, discipline or cure <b>the</b> <b>pet.</b> <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> has intelligence and friendliness levels, depending on how well the user looks after it. However, <b>the</b> Happy <b>Pet</b> does not evolve. The three buttons {{can be used to}} feed <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> or play games with it. The buttons {{can also be used to}} see what <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> is currently thinking or feeling.|$|R

Other human characters include Mrs. Twombly, owner of the shop and Blythe's boss, and Youngmee Song, Sue Patterson, and Jasper Jones, Blythe's schoolmates.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{third of}} those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some {{survivors}} died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. Of the groups shown in the table, 49% of the children, 26% of the female passengers, 82% of the male passengers and 78% of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic, especially among women and children. Although less than 10percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54% of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged 2. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92% died. Additionally, among <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> brought aboard, three survived the sinking.|$|E

5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> gets sick, a skull icon appears next to <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> as it sits {{still at}} the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> can become sick for a number of reasons such as {{overfeeding}} of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> can die if sickness is left unchecked. <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> can be cured by pressing the [...] "Medicine" [...] option. Usually a pet will not play or be fed a meal when sick. Pets would often fall asleep during the night time. Originally players had the option of manually turning off the light when <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> fell asleep (it would turn on the light by itself when it awoke). In order to raise a healthy pet, players were encouraged but not required to turn off the lights when <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> fell asleep. In recent versions, <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> turns off <b>the</b> light on its own when it went to sleep. Recent versions also allow waking <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> for a short time once it has fallen asleep. V5 had the three children look outside on the window when they wake up in the morning and before bed at night.|$|R
5000|$|Pets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter, Bracelet {{meter and}} Discipline meter to {{determine}} how healthy and well behaved <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of <b>the</b> <b>pet.</b> Filling up <b>the</b> Hunger meter {{can be achieved by}} feeding <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> a meal (usually a loaf of bread) or a snack (usually a piece of candy). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini games with <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini games vary between versions, but mainly involve guessing which way <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> will turn (left or right) within 5 tries. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the [...] "scold" [...] option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> will leave droppings around the screen from time to time, and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> goes to <b>the</b> bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> has gone to <b>the</b> bathroom, <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> can be potty trained.|$|R
5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> as characters, so the Cahills {{sought to}} expand the human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show is accomplished by film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television a source of pride.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pet's</b> {{appearance}} can radically {{change at}} grades 12 and 18 using special mushroom items. The appearance change is purely aesthetic - {{it does not}} affect <b>the</b> <b>pet's</b> skills or attributes.

50|$|Long-term {{interactivity}} includes {{action that}} affects <b>the</b> <b>pet's</b> growth, behavior or life span. For example, training a pet {{may have a}} good effect on <b>the</b> <b>pet's</b> behavior.

25|$|A {{good deal}} of the dialog is sung, so the show has been likened to {{operetta}} or singspiel. A 10-member live orchestra performs each episode, sometimes including other instrumentalists skilled in music from the region to which <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> are traveling during the episode.

The game allowed people to bet on National Football League games, with the revenues used to provide funding to intercollegiate athletics in the state. Her bill did not become law, and the lottery game continued until 2005. She also supported legislation to allow patients at the Oregon State Hospital and prisoners in the corrections system to receive visits from pets. The legislation was introduced in 1983 and would have establish guidelines where inmates and prisoners under certain conditions could receive the visits due to <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> therapeutic benefits.|$|E

In 2012, Dixon travelled to Romania with [...] World Animal Protection to rescue two brown bears from Onesti Zoo, which had closed years previously. The bears were moved to a nearby sanctuary. In 2014, Dixon encouraged her Twitter followers to sign an online petition calling for the ban of slaughtering animals without being stunned first. UK and EU law requires that animals must be stunned before slaughter, unless for religious purposes (Halal or Kosher meat). Dixon is also a supporter of the PetRetreat scheme launched by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The scheme fosters pets belonging to victims of domestic abuse, who often have to leave behind animals, as many refuges and safe houses do not allow pets. <b>The</b> <b>pets</b> are later reunited with their original owners when possible.|$|E
500|$|Westerners {{were more}} {{enthusiastic}} toward the game {{than were the}} Japanese, although {{there were a few}} negative appraisals. [...] GamePro magazine opined Alisia Dragoons responsive controls, coupled with the hectic action and handsome graphics, made the game highly desirable for owners of the Genesis console. The Lessers of Dragon magazine were equally impressed with the gameplay, praising Alisia Dragoon for its [...] "solid arcade action" [...] that satisfied their [...] "need for fast reflexes". Mean Machiness Julian Rignall praised the game for its pet monsters design, calling the management of <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> in the game an encouragement toward tactics. His fellow reviewer, Richard Leadbetter, wrote the game was visually attractive with [...] "beautiful sprites" [...] and [...] "amazing backdrops". He found the gameplay challenging, being forced to conserve energy as the game [...] " [...] everything but the kitchen sink at [...] ". Rignall agreed with Leadbetter on the game's difficulty, which along with the secret rooms and power-ups to be discovered made Alisia Dragoon an excellent action platform game that had long-lasting appeal. [...] Of the hundreds of Genesis games, Mega magazine rated Alisia Dragoon among the top 100 games, calling it [...] " [...] the best dragon-based platform game around." [...] Despite the positive sentiments, sales of the game outside Japan were weak.|$|E
500|$|After taping {{the pilot}} episode for Power of 10, Carey was {{contacted}} by CBS about replacing Bob Barker—who had earlier announced his own retirement—as host of The Price Is Right. After initially turning down the offer, Carey announced on Late Show with David Letterman {{that he would}} succeed Barker as host of the program beginning {{in the fall of}} 2007. His first episode of The Price Is Right was taped on August 15, and his shows began airing on October 15. In response to replacing Barker as host of the game show, Carey stated [...] "You can't replace Bob Barker. I don't compare myself to anybody... It's only about what you're doing and supposed to do, and I feel like I'm supposed to be doing this." [...] When Carey began hosting, the set, theme music, and show logo were updated. However, Carey kept the old closing line about spaying and neutering <b>the</b> <b>pets</b> that originated with Barker, although his version uses slightly different wording. During Carey's second year as host, he began to write some of the sketches used during the Showcase, which sometimes features guest appearances by stars of other CBS programs. In the April Fools' Day 2013 episode, Carey and announcer George Gray switched places with the models, letting the two men be the models for the episode. On the April Fools' Day 2014 episode, Carey and Gray traded positions with Craig Ferguson (who was hosting The Late Late Show at the time) and Shadoe Stevens, reprising their respective roles on Ferguson's show while Ferguson hosted and Stevens announced on Price. On the first week of Season 46 (September 18-22, 2017), Carey celebrated his ten years as host of the show, joining Barker as the only two to have hosted for at least a decade.|$|E

30|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>PET</b> and MT {{coordinate}} {{systems are not}} necessarily aligned to each other, the transformation matrix to convert the recorded motion data into PET coordinates must be determined.

By comparing the MT data with <b>the</b> <b>PET</b> reconstructions, it is possible to determine a suitable transformation between the {{coordinate systems}} [18]. A reference marker attached to <b>the</b> <b>PET</b> gantry (see Fig. 1) allows us to use the same calibration on different scan days even if the MT has been moved.|$|R

5000|$|To give a {{sense of}} reality to users, most digital pets have certain level of {{autonomy}} and unpredictability. The user can interact with <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> and this process of personalizing can make <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> more distinctive.

50|$|Poor {{care can}} cause a pet to die, {{but it can also}} die of old age. If an old pet dies without {{producing}} offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death, or simply a floating UFO to indicate its return to its home planet. Often at times it will show the transition graphic, after which it will show <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> appearing to be sick, but with the skull flashing, beeping as it flashes. It then will show a happy version of <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> flashing with a longer beep, with an egg {{on the right side of}} the screen, after which it will show <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> as an angel (as indicated above).
