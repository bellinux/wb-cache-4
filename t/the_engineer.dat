5|$|David prepares Weyland for an {{excursion}} to <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> ship. Shaw asks David {{about his}} freedom after Weyland's eventual demise, {{to which he}} ominously asks about every child's dream of having their parents dead. He leads the team to the flight deck of the ship, where he awakens and speaks with <b>the</b> <b>Engineer,</b> who reacts by decapitating him and killing {{the rest of the}} team, save for Shaw. David's severed head watches from the floor as <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> launches the ship and attempts to embark for Earth. After the ship is disabled by Prometheus getting purposefully crashed into it, David warns Shaw that <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> is coming for her. David contacts Shaw after she escapes <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> and convinces her to retrieve his head and body, so that he may pilot another ship. Shaw dictates that she will cooperate with him if he takes them to <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> home world, which he agrees to, despite not understanding her motivations.

5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, he lands the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the schematics which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn radio for direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken <b>the</b> <b>Engineer,</b> Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will {{do whatever is necessary}} to protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the human race. Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> ship, and orders everyone to leave.

40|$|To <b>the</b> contractor, <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> {{estimate}} is <b>the</b> target number to aim for, and {{the basis for}} a contractor to evaluate the accuracy of their estimate. To <b>the</b> owner, <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> {{estimate is}} <b>the</b> basis for funding, evaluation of bids, and for predicting project costs. As such <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate is <b>the</b> benchmark. This research sought to investigate the reliance on, and the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate in heavy civil cost estimate. The research objective was to characterize <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate and allow owners and contractors re-evaluate or affirm their reliance on <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate. A literature review was conducted to understand the reliance on <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate, and secondary data from Washington State Department of Transportation was used to investigate the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate. <b>The</b> findings show the need for practitioners to re-evaluate their reliance on <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate. <b>The</b> empirical data showed that, within various contexts, <b>the</b> <b>engineer’s</b> estimate fell outside the expected accuracy range of the low bids or the cost to complete projects. The study recommends direct tracking of costs by project owners while projects are under construction, the use of a second estimate to improve the accuracy of their estimates, and use of the cost estimating practices found in highly reputable construction companies...|$|R

5|$|A monstrous, mutated Fifield {{returns to}} the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates that the {{structure}} was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> from stasis and speaks to him {{in an attempt to}} explain what Weyland wants. <b>The</b> <b>Engineer</b> responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> is pursuing her. <b>The</b> <b>Engineer</b> forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.|$|E

5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building <b>the</b> <b>engineer</b> went up to the 22nd floor to investigate.

5|$|By 1774, canal {{building}} {{was much better}} understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked Thomas Dadford, Jr., <b>the</b> <b>engineer</b> on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy, who had been <b>the</b> <b>engineer</b> on the Droitwich Canal during its construction, {{to carry out a}} survey. The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at £16,750, and soon £20,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month. A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of £20,000 and an extra £10,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.|$|E

5|$|David 8 (Michael Fassbender) is Peter Weyland's {{synthetic}} {{assistant and}} {{the creator of}} the Aliens. The eighth in a line of David models representing Weyland's unfulfilled wish for a son, David was created by a middle-age Weyland, named after the eponymous Michelangelo statue. While the Prometheus is en route to LV-223, David studies the Engineers' (presumed) dialects, human culture and the dreams of the crew. After their arrival, David accompanies the expedition to the Juggernaut, where he acquires a vial of a black, extraterrestrial liquid. David contaminates a drink he gives Holloway to impregnate Shaw with an extraterrestrial life form. He explores the Juggernaut and cuts his feed to Vickers, giving Weyland private-screening access as he learns about a last-surviving Engineer in cryosleep. David prepares Weyland for the expedition to awaken <b>the</b> <b>Engineer.</b> He translates Weyland's request for immortality, and <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> decapitates him and kills the rest of the expedition except for Shaw. After Janek crashes the Prometheus into the Juggernaut, David's severed head warns Shaw that <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> is coming to kill her. He contacts her after she escapes from the life-support unit, telling her {{that he would like to}} help her escape LV-223 by piloting another Engineer ship. After Shaw recovers his head and body, he promises to take her to the Engineers' home world and they leave LV-223. David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen on the Engineers' home world, wiping them out along with all other non-floral life. David conducts experiments with the mutagen to create the perfect organism, and using Shaw's body for the experiments. When an expedition from the colony ship Covenant arrives ten years later, David saves them from Neomorphs. He leads them to his base situated at <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> temple, where he becomes acquainted with his successor android, Walter, and lures Oram to get impregnated by a Facehugger, giving birth to the first Xenomorph. David is confronted by Walter about Shaw's fate, prompting David to disable him. David attacks Daniels, but is interrupted by the recuperated Walter. The two androids fight, with David emerging the victor and discretely assuming Walter's identity. After escaping to the Covenant, David coordinates the defense against the Alien that infiltrated the ship. After Daniels defeats the creature, David helps her and Tennessee into the sleeping pods. With Daniels in the pod, David reveals his true identity and puts her to sleep. David regurgitates two Facehugger embryos that he refrigerates with the human embryos and, impersonating Walter, sends out a transmission proclaiming that Daniels and Tennessee are the only survivors of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. <b>The</b> <b>Engineer</b> ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when <b>the</b> <b>Engineer</b> ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E
