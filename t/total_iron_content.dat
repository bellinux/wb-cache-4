40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyMichel D. RansomFactors {{governing}} potassium fixation {{and release}} are poorly understood. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of clay mineralogy and structural iron oxidation state on potassium fixation. Five reference clays and two soil clays were used to capture a range in mineralogical compositions and potassium behaviors. Reference clays used were illite (IMt- 1), kaolinite (KGa- 1 b), montmorillonite (STx- 1 b), nontronite (NAu- 2), and vermiculite (VTx- 1). Soil clays used were from the upper 15 cm of a Belvue loam (BEL) and a Cherokee silt (CHE). Potassium fixation capacities were measured on unaltered as well as sodium dithionite reduced forms of each clay. Ferrous and <b>total</b> <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> were determined photometrically using 1, 10 -phenanthroline. Potassium fixation was measured by potassium saturating the clays and washing off exchangeable and solution potassium with solutions of magnesium chloride; samples were then acid digested and the amount fixed was calculated as the amount of potassium in the acid digestion minus the amount originally in the sample. BEL released potassium rather than fixed it while CHE tended to release potassium in the unaltered form and fix potassium in the reduced form. Structural iron reduction significantly impacted the amounts of potassium fixed by VTx- 1 and NAu- 2, which had the highest <b>total</b> <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> of all the clays evaluated. NAu- 2 and VTx- 1 both on average fixed less than 1 mg K g clay[superscript]- 1 in the unaltered form and an average of 6 and 11 mg K g clay[superscript]- 1, respectively, in the reduced form. Regardless of being in the unaltered or reduced form, KGa- 1 b fixed essentially no potassium and IMt- 1 and STx- 1 b fixed intermediate amounts of potassium— 2 to 4 mg K g clay[superscript]- 1 on average. The effects of clay mineralogy and structural iron oxidation state on potassium fixation can largely be explained through an understanding of layer type, layer charge, and charge distribution. In order for potassium fixation to occur, interlayer sites need to be accessible and available. Generally, the greater the negative layer charge the greater the amounts of fixation, with tetrahedral layer charge favoring fixation more than octahedral layer charge, and layer charge being a function of structural iron oxidation state...|$|R

Magnetic measurements suggested that lepidocrocite converted to the more stable meaghemite (gamma-Fe 203) by mild heat treatment and then to nanophase hematite (aplha-Fe 203) by extensive heat treatment. Their chemical reactivity offers a plausible mechanism for the somewhat puzzling observations of the Viking biology experiments.

We find that KD decreases slowly from about 0. 32 to 0. 06 with depth under lower mantle conditions. We also find that KD increases sharply to 0. 15 in the very lowermost mantle due to the strong temperature increases near the CMB. Spin transitions have a large effect on the activity of ferropericlase which causes KD to vary with pressure in a peak-like fashion. Despite the apparently large changes in KD through the mantle, this actually results in relatively small changes in <b>total</b> <b>iron</b> <b>content</b> in the two phases, with XFefp ranging from about 0. 20 to 0. 35, before decreasing again to about 0. 28 at the CMB, and XFebd has a pretty constant value of about 0. 04 – 0. 07 throughout the lower mantle.

Our aim was to produce grains with increased amounts of bioavailable iron in the endosperm. Maize seeds expressing recombinant phytase showed enzymatic activities of up to 3 IU per gram of seed. In flour paste prepared from these seeds, up to 95 % of the endogenous phytic acid was degraded, with a concomitant increase in the amount of available phosphate. In seeds expressing ferritin in addition to phytase, the <b>total</b> <b>iron</b> <b>content</b> was significantly increased. To evaluate the impact of the recombinant proteins on iron absorption in the human gut, we used an in vitro digestion/Caco- 2 cell model. We found that phytase in the maize seeds was associated with increased cellular iron uptake, and that the rate of iron uptake correlated with the level of phytase expression regardless of the <b>total</b> <b>iron</b> <b>content</b> of the seeds. We also investigated iron bioavailability under more complex meal conditions by adding ascorbic acid, which promotes iron uptake, to all samples. This resulted in a further increase in iron absorption, but the effects of phytase and ascorbic acid were not additive. We conclude that the expression of recombinant ferritin and phytase could help to increase iron availability and enhance the absorption of iron, particularly in cereal-based diets that lack other nutritional components...|$|E
40|$|Transferrin {{receptor}} (TfR) {{expression is}} regulated by iron {{at the level}} of mRNA stability through a factor (IRF/ IRE-BP) which binds to specific iron-responsive elements (IRE). On the other hand, growth-dependent regulation of TfR expression is generally believed to be transcriptionally controlled. We analyzed the molecular mechanisms that control TfR gene expression at the onset of cell proliferation in vivo during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. The amount of TfR mRNA increased considerably after partial hepatectomy while run-on assays did not show significant changes in TfR gene transcription. RNA band-shift assays documented a significant activation of IRF/IRE-BP specific for the faster migrating IRE-protein complex (IRF(B)). These changes occurred in the absence of modifications of <b>total</b> liver <b>iron</b> concentration but together with a significant decrease of ferritin content. Moreover, when extreme variations of liver <b>iron</b> <b>content</b> were achieved by either chronic iron overload or severe iron deficiency, liver regeneration was unable to influence IRE-binding activity.

All underwent physical examination, standardised pulmonary function tests (spirometry, lung volume, and single breath diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide), and magnetic resonance imaging measurements of the liver. Serum ferritin was measured. The signal intensity ratio of liver to that of paraspinal muscle (T 1 weighted sequence) and serum ferri-tin were used as surrogate index of body <b>iron</b> <b>content.</b> Results: Sixteen boys and 13 girls (median age 14. 2 years) were studied. None had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure. Sixteen had normal lung function. Impairment of diffusion capacity (median DLco 83. 5 % predicted) was the most common abnormality, being observed in 34 % of patients. Pure restrictive and obstructive ventilatory impairment was found in one and two patients respectively. Five patients had a combination of ventilation and diffusion defects. There was no correlation between the degree of impairment of each respiratory abnormality and body <b>iron</b> <b>content.</b> Conclusion: Diffusion impairment was the commonest abnormality found in our cohort of paediatric TM patients. Our data did not support the notion that respiratory function impairment was correlate...|$|R
