2500|$|Following Coleridge's {{response}} was an anonymous {{review in the}} May 1820 Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, possible by either John Lockhart and John Wilson together or just Lockhart on his own. Of Wordsworth's abilities as a poet in general, the review claimed: [...] "Mr Wordsworth ... is entitled to be classed with the very highest names among his predecessors, as a pure and reverent worshipper of the true majest of the English Muse" [...] and that [...] "Of the genius of Mr Wordsworth, in short, it {{is now in the}} hands of every man to judge freely and fully, and for himself. Our own opinion, ever since this Journal commenced, has been clearly and entirely before them; and if there be any one person, on whose mind what we have quoted now, is not enough to make an impression similar to that which our own judgment had long before received– we have nothing more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> person in regard to the subject of poetry." [...] In discussing the ode in particular, the review characterised the poem as [...] "one of the grandest of his early pieces". In December 1820 came an article in the New Monthly Magazine titled [...] "On the Genius and Writings of Wordsworth" [...] written by Thomas Noon Talfourd. When discussing the poem, Talfourd declared that the ode [...] "is, to our feelings, the noblest piece of lyric poetry in the world. It was the first poem of its author which we read, and never shall we forget the sensations which it excited within us. We had heard the cold sneers attached to his name... and here – in the works of this derided poet – we found a new vein of imaginative sentiment open to us – sacred recollections brought back to our hearts with all the freshness of novelty, and all the venerableness of far-off time". When analysing the relationship between infants and the divine within the poem, the article continued: [...] "What a gift did we then inherit! To have the best and most imperishable of intellectual treasures – the mighty world of reminiscences of the days of infancy – set before us in a new and holier light".|$|E
