5|$|Halotus {{worked as}} a servant for Claudius and also held the {{position}} of official taster, an occupation which entailed his tasting of a portion of every meal Claudius ate each day for poison. <b>Tasters</b> also worked to detect less sinister problems with the Emperor's meal, such as whether the food was fit to be consumed.|$|E
5|$|The Zana-tompo (or Andriantompokoindrindra) {{were also}} {{considered}} elders, and Andriamasinavalona decreed that kings would henceforth select {{their wives and}} royal food <b>tasters</b> from among this caste. The rites pertaining to circumcision were another honor reserved for the Zana-tompo. The king decreed that they should inhabit the countryside south of the capital extending from Ambavahadimitafo southward to Ambatolampy. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zana-tompo lived {{in the village of}} Ambohimalaza.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Adaptive Coloration in Animals, Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage {{in nature and}} in war” in the Royal Engineers Journal (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form in relation to appearance” in Lancelot Law Whyte, ed. Aspects of form: a symposium on form in nature and art (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg <b>tasters.</b> In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the kittiwake eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E

25|$|It is not {{considered}} rude to spit out wine at a winery, even {{in the presence of}} the wine maker or owner. Generally, a spittoon will be provided. In some regions of the world, <b>tasters</b> simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.|$|E
40|$|An audio <b>taster</b> {{of my book}} The Sound of Nonsense. The <b>taster</b> {{includes}} {{samples of}} recordings {{of the work of}} some of the novelists, poets, musicians and performers who are used as case studies in the book. The <b>taster</b> is designed to both provide an overview of {{the subject matter of the}} book and to model one of the types of sonic nonsense discussed in the book, namely the sometimes incomprehensible babble produced by the sonic palimpsest...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of sensory tests. The most classic is the sensory profile. In this test, each <b>taster</b> {{describes}} each product {{by means of a}} questionnaire. The questionnaire includes a list of descriptors (e.g., bitterness, acidity, etc.). The <b>taster</b> rates each descriptor for each product depending on the intensity of the descriptor he perceives in the product (e.g., 0 = very weak to 10 = very strong). In the method of Free choice profiling, each <b>taster</b> builds his own questionnaire.|$|R

25|$|Because {{intoxication}} {{can affect}} the consumer's judgment, wine <b>tasters</b> generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{impartial}} {{judgment of}} a wine, {{it should be}} served blind – that is, without the <b>taster(s)</b> having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask {{the color of the}} wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.|$|E
25|$|In the Scoville {{organoleptic}} test, {{an exact}} weight of dried pepper is dissolved in alcohol {{to extract the}} heat components (capsaicinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water. Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsaicinoids are given to a panel of five trained <b>tasters,</b> until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.|$|E
50|$|Stool - Traditionally {{there is}} a short stool upon which the coffee <b>taster</b> sits with the {{spittoon}} between his/her legs. The stool is intended to raise the <b>taster</b> to the correct level {{with respect to the}} spittoon and the coffee tasting table to facilitate tasting.|$|R

25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check secondary fermentation {{in as much as}} it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine <b>tasters</b> sometimes describe a wine which has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or maderized.|$|E
25|$|Winemakers will {{sometimes}} add acids to the wine (acidification) {{to make the}} wine more acidic, most commonly in warm climate regions where grapes are often harvested at advanced stages of ripeness {{with high levels of}} sugars, but very low levels of acid. Tartaric acid is most often added, but winemakers {{will sometimes}} add citric or malic acid. Acids can be added either before or after primary fermentation. They can be added during blending or aging, but the increased acidity will become more noticeable to wine <b>tasters</b> if added at this point.|$|E
25|$|Chile {{has benefited}} from an influx of foreign {{investment}} and winemaking talent {{that began in the}} late 20th century. Flying winemakers introduced new technology and styles that helped Chilean wineries produce more internationally recognized wine styles. One such improvement was the use of oak. Historically Chilean winemakers had aged their wines in barrels made from rauli beechwood which imparted to the wine a unique taste that many international <b>tasters</b> found unpleasant. Gradually the wineries began to convert to French and American oak or stainless steel tanks for aging.|$|E

Later, Nestlé introduced a new brand in Canada and the US called <b>Taster's</b> Choice, which supplanted Nescafé for many years. The company continues to sell <b>Taster's</b> Choice as a separate product, branded as superior to Nescafé and higher priced.|$|R
25|$|This {{blending}} may be purely quantitative: various vintages can be blended {{to achieve}} the desired volume. It can also be qualitative; the taster or a team of <b>tasters</b> (cellar master, winemaker, owner of the estate, etc.) {{determine the amount of}} each wine to mix together in the final blend to obtain optimum quality. In winemaking blending is always empirical, it cannot be predicted that the combination of two or more vintages will give the expected product. The only secure values are analytical values (alcoholic strength, acidity, pH, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Besides {{this range}} of glasses, {{the work of}} a team of <b>tasters,</b> {{including}} Jules Chauvet of the INAO in France, led to the creation in 1970 of the INAO glass. This glass has a thin glass wall and curve calculated to be able to taste all wines. This glass is used, among others, during the approval tastings – the gateway for the wines to be entitled to bear the name of an appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC). This simple but elegant glass {{can also be used to}} serve wine at the table.|$|E
25|$|Sancerre {{is often}} {{compared}} to neighboring Pouilly-Fumé which also specializes in 100% Sauvignon blanc wines, {{and while there}} are some differences, wine experts like Robinson, Johnson and Karen MacNeil note that only very experienced <b>tasters</b> can distinguish the differences in a blind tasting. Broadly speaking, Sancerre tends to have a fuller body with more pronounced aromas, while Pouilly-Fumé wines are more perfumed. However, both wines have naturally high acidity and the potential to exhibit the minerally, flinty notes described as pierre à fusil or gunflint, as well as citrus and spicy notes.|$|E

25|$|Wine tasting (often, in wine circles, simply tasting) is {{the sensory}} {{examination}} {{and evaluation of}} wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine <b>tasters</b> (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology {{which is used to}} describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.|$|E
25|$|However, many growers, traders, and {{consumers}} reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic {{method of sampling}} batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine <b>tasters.</b> However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century as Chilean wines became more popular, wine <b>tasters</b> {{around the world}} began to doubt the {{authenticity}} of wines labeled Merlot and Sauvignon blanc. The wines lack many of the characteristics and typicity of those grapes. Ampelographers began to study the vines and found that what was considered Merlot was actually the ancient Bordeaux wine grape Carménère that {{was thought to be}} extinct. The Sauvignon blanc vines were found to actually be Sauvignonasse, also known as Sauvignon vert, or a mutated Sauvignon blanc/Sémillon cross. In response to these discoveries several Chilean wineries began to import true Merlot and Sauvignon blanc cuttings to where most bottles labeled Merlot and Sauvignon blanc from vintages in the 21st century {{are more likely to be}} those varieties.|$|E
