50|$|Byrne {{was greatly}} {{preoccupied with the}} study of <b>traffic</b> <b>facilities.</b> As far back as 1916 he {{conceived}} {{the idea of the}} Triborough Bridge to link the Boroughs of Manhattan, Bronx, and Queens.

The actual work on the foundations and anchorages was begun in 1929 under his direction, while Chief Engineer of the Department of Plant and Structures.|$|E
50|$|Another {{instance}} of Byrne’s active concern with <b>traffic</b> <b>facilities</b> is his advocacy of a vehicular tunnel from the Battery to Hamilton Avenue, in Brooklyn, N.

In 1929, also, he prepared preliminary plans and estimates for a vehicular tunnel under the East River from Manhattan Island at Thirty-eight Street to the Borough of Queens.|$|E
5000|$|Until 1415, Schlieren {{belonged to}} Habsburg. After {{the conquest of}} Aargau by the Swiss Confederates it was a {{component}} of the county of Baden.

Thanks to the proximity to the city of Zürich and the good <b>traffic</b> <b>facilities</b> (Tram, S-Bahn), Schlieren showed a population growth of 10,000 since the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The main {{factor for}} {{determining}} if a ground delay program {{is needed is}} a number called Airport Arrival Rate (AAR).

50|$|The airline {{industry}} began using teletypewriter {{technology in the}} early 1920s using radio stations located at 10 airfields in the United States. The US Post Office and other US government agencies used these radio stations for transmitting telegraph messages.

50|$|The {{architecture}} of MTR stations is less artistic, instead focusing on structural practicability. With {{the high level}} of daily passenger <b>traffic,</b> <b>facilities</b> of the MTR stations are built with durability and accessibility in mind. After extensive retrofitting, the MTR system has become, in general, disabled-friendly — the trains have dedicated wheelchair space, the stations have special floor tiles to guide the blind safely on the platforms, and there are extra wide entry and exit gates for wheelchairs as well. On board the rolling stock, there are also flashing system maps on select trains while Active Line Diagrams and traditional route maps are installed on the others. Infopanels as well as on Newsline Express TVs onboard trains display important messages such as next station announcements as well as operational messages.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the display}} side, the round radar is being {{replaced}} by computer-driven cathode ray tubes, which now are {{being replaced by}} modern LCD flat screens in en route systems. However a great many US Air Traffic TRACON facilities and Towers still use the older cathode ray tube technology. Most of the larger TRACONs employ a 20" [...] x 20" [...] Sony color tube display; Common ARTS uses the ARTS Color Display (ACD) and the Remote ARTS Color Display (R-ACD), while STARS uses the Terminal Control Workstation (TCW) and Tower Display Workstation (TDW). Towers are slowly replacing old DBrite (cathode ray type remote displays) with an LCD type manufactured by Barco. However these display replacements are currently installed only at the busiest facilities with lower density <b>traffic</b> <b>facilities</b> slated for retrofit later.|$|E

5000|$|At Wemyss Bay ... {{quite apart}} from the beauty of the station itself, the <b>traffic</b> <b>facilities</b> {{provided}} in the reconstruction of 1900 are remarkable in themselves. The enterprising timetables of the day required that a train and a steamer should arrive simultaneously, and exchange passengers. Although the changeover {{did not need to be}} done at the lightning speed demanded by the most competitive services at Gourock, there was to be no dawdling about. The station platforms, and the approach ways to the steamer berths, were therefore made exceptionally wide, so that two opposing streams of pedestrians could pass without interference. From the railway point of view, while the two long island platforms provided four platform faces for trains, a third line was laid in between the two island platforms to enable locomotives of incoming trains to be released immediately on arrival, and [...] "run round" [...] their trains.|$|E

In spite of all these beautiness it maintains, it has degraded its value in terms of opening up of more private schools demanding higher fees and private tutoring. The place may be named a hub of accidents as it the connecting place to Puri and situated in high way with no extension of roads and <b>traffic</b> <b>facilities.</b> No doubt the place is neat,clean with street lights always available but the cases happen regarding snatching,stealing in terms of crime also needs to be more aware and security. And also plantation of more and more trees are required as within just five years it has infinite number of apartments and flats to build up. So this environmental condition of this place should be taken care of.|$|E

The paper analyses the characteristics of five potential locations (alternatives), the selection of criteria and measures for assessing the alternatives and presents the input data preparation, the application of the selected method and the analysis results. All the relevant criteria for the analyses were included: the traffic, the economic criteria and those which nowadays are of great significance: the influence of the facility on the environment and the social criteria which is in accordance with the sustainable development principles. The goal of the paper is to present the procedure of the AHP method application on the complex issue of traffic planning and to confirm the adequacy of the chosen method on the <b>traffic</b> <b>facility</b> strategic planning...|$|R
