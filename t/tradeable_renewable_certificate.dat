40|$|Concern {{about climate}} change and concerted {{international}} action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are powerful new drivers for renewable energy. Australia has progressively adopted a series of policies relating to the climate change issue with the initial National Greenhouse Response Strategy of 1992 being added to in 1997 by a suite of policies under the banner Safeguarding the Future and developing into the National Greenhouse Strategy in 1998. A further policy package was announced in 1999 under the heading Measures for a Better Environment. Together with State and Territory policies Australia now has over 100 policies aimed at the issue of climate change and backed by over A$ 1 billion of committed funds. Australia has developed a national <b>tradeable</b> <b>renewable</b> energy <b>certificate</b> system to encourage additional renewable energy in electricity supplies. The paper outlines {{the objectives of the}} Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act, its legal framework, describes the tradeable certificate mechanism and summarises the experience of the first year of operation of the Act...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificates</b> (RECs), {{also known}} as Green tags, Renewable Energy Credits, <b>Renewable</b> Electricity <b>Certificates,</b> or Tradable <b>Renewable</b> <b>Certificates</b> (TRCs), are tradable, non-tangible energy {{commodities}} in the United States that represent proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy resource (renewable electricity) and was fed into the shared system of power lines which transport energy. Solar <b>renewable</b> energy <b>certificates</b> (SRECs) are RECs that are specifically generated by solar energy. <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificates</b> provide a mechanism {{for the purchase of}} renewable energy that is added to and pulled from the electrical grid.|$|R
25|$|A Renewable Portfolio Standard {{refers to}} {{legislation}} {{that creates a}} market in <b>tradeable</b> <b>renewable</b> or green electricity certificates. Electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity (portfolio) from renewable generation sources. Liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market.|$|R

50|$|Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and {{subsidies}} create protected markets for renewable energy. RPS require utilities {{to obtain a}} minimum percentage of their energy from renewable sources. In some states, utilities can purchase <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificates</b> (USA), <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificate</b> System (EU), <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificates</b> Registry (AUS) to meet this requirement. These certificates are issued to renewable energy producers based {{on the amount of}} energy they feed into the grid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} different trading {{options that}} exist {{to reconcile the}} geographical disparities between supply and demand for bioenergy and bioenergy services, depending upon the specific situation of the “exporting ” and “importing ” country. Trade in biomass fuels, electricity, <b>renewable</b> <b>certificates,</b> and CO 2 credits are introduced and presented as options for business and policy makers {{as they try to}} meet increasing energy demands {{while at the same time}} addressing national and international commitments to reducing CO 2 (GHG) emissions and increasing renewable energy sources...|$|R
50|$|It is {{proposed}} that Feed-in tariffs with Contracts for Difference (FIT CfD) {{will replace the}} current support mechanism, the Renewables Obligation (RO), in 2017 after running in parallel from 2013. The Renewables Obligation encourages the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources by awarding <b>Renewable</b> Obligation <b>Certificates</b> (ROCs) to generators. <b>Renewables</b> Obligation <b>Certificates</b> provide an additional source of income in {{that they can be}} sold to suppliers who are obligated to source an increasing amount of the electricity they provide from renewable energy sources.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the energy sourcing decision problem faced by industrial power consumers who must determine their long-term electricity procurement plan {{and need to}} evaluate various options to meet load requirements for their facilities including those which may involve on-site renewable generation. Other than sourcing from on-site renewable generation such as solar photovoltaic or wind, power can be purchased from spot markets or through a power purchase agreement, i. e. energy supply contract. We develop a mixed-integer linear model to make decisions that include investments in renewable generation, power purchases from spot markets, and amount sourced from supply contracts. Taking into account <b>renewable</b> energy <b>certificates,</b> the model's objective is to maximize revenue from trading <b>renewable</b> <b>certificates</b> minus the expected total costs of investing and operating on-site renewable generation, and purchasing from electricity markets. Real load data from manufacturing plants are used to illustrate a numerical case study for our model...|$|R

5000|$|Solar <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificates</b> (SRECs) or Solar Renewable Energy Credits are {{a form of}} <b>Renewable</b> Energy <b>Certificate</b> or [...] "Green tag" [...] {{existing}} in the United States of America. SRECs exist in states that have Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) legislation with specific requirements for solar energy, usually {{referred to as a}} [...] "solar carve-out". The additional income received from selling SRECs increases the economic value of a solar investment and assists with the financing of solar technology. In conjunction with state and federal incentives, solar system owners can recover their investment in solar by selling their SRECs through spot market sales or long-term sales, both described below.|$|R
