50|$|Fluoride's effects {{depend on}} the <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of {{fluoride}} from all sources. About 70-90% of ingested fluoride is absorbed into the blood, where it distributes throughout the body. In infants 80-90% of absorbed fluoride is retained, with the rest excreted, mostly via urine; in adults about 60% is retained. About 99% of retained fluoride is stored in bone, teeth, and other calcium-rich areas, where excess quantities can cause fluorosis. Drinking water is typically the largest source of fluoride. In many industrialized countries swallowed toothpaste is {{the main source of}} fluoride exposure in unfluoridated communities. Other sources include dental products other than toothpaste; air pollution from fluoride-containing coal or from phosphate fertilizers; trona, used to tenderize meat in Tanzania; and tea leaves, particularly the tea bricks favored in parts of China. High fluoride levels have been found in other foods, including barley, cassava, corn, rice, taro, yams, and fish protein concentrate. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has established Dietary Reference Intakes for fluoride: Adequate Intake values range from 0.01 mg/day for infants aged 6 months or less, to 4 mg/day for men aged 19 years and up; and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 0.10 mg/kg/day for infants and children through age 8 years, and 10 mg/day thereafter. A rough estimate is that an adult in a temperate climate consumes 0.6 mg/day of fluoride without fluoridation, and 2 mg/day with fluoridation. However, these values differ greatly among the world's regions: for example, in Sichuan, China the average daily fluoride intake is only 0.1 mg/day in drinking water but 8.9 mg/day in food and 0.7 mg/day directly from the air due to the use of high-fluoride soft coal for cooking and drying foodstuffs indoors.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: There {{is little}} data in Australian {{children}} assessing dietary fibre intakes or ready-to-eat cereal consumption. The aims were to: (i) assess the dietary fibre intake of 2 - to 16 -year-old {{children from the}} 2007 Australian National Children’s Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey; (ii) determine the percentage of children meeting adequate fibre intake; and (iii) determine the contribution of breakfast and ready-to-eat cereal fibre intake. METHODS: Secondary analysis of the 2007 Australian National Children’s Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. RESULTS: On {{the day of the}} survey, the mean (SE) dietary fibre intake among all children at breakfast was 4. 5 (0. 1) g and <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> fibre <b>intake</b> was 20. 7 (0. 2) g. Fibre adequacy was achieved by 50 % of Australian children. Forty-nine percent of all children consumed ready-to-eat cereal, providing 2 / 3 of fibre intake at breakfast and 1 / 10 of <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> fibre <b>intake.</b> Consuming ready-to-eat cereal {{was a significant predictor of}} <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> fibre <b>intake</b> (b = 0. 028).

40|$|The study {{reported}} herein {{was conducted to}} establish the concentration of two essential fatty acids; linoleic acid (LA) 18 : 2 n- 6 and Î±-linolenic acid (ALA) 18 : 3 n- 3; and three long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA); eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 20 : 5 n- 3, decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 22 : 6 n- 3 and arachidonic acid (AA) 20 : 4 n- 6 in fish based commercial infant foods in the UK. Quantitative analyses were conducted on four different products using charged aerosol detection HPLC. The <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intake</b> of fatty acids from the consumption of such products was estimated based on the standard menu by Zand et al. The LA:ALA ratio {{was found to be}} higher than the recommended ratio. Furthermore the concentrations of DHA and AA were found to be lower than recommended adequate intakes, which may have negative effects vision and brain development of infants...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{zinc content}} of maize, a major global food staple, is {{generally}} insufficient alone {{to meet the}} requirements of young children. Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether substitution of biofortified maize (34 mg zinc/g grain) for control maize (21 mg zinc/g) was adequate to meet zinc physiologic requirements in young children for whom maize was the major food staple. A secondary objective was to compare <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> zinc absorption when maize flour was fortified with zinc oxide to a total concentration of 60 mg zinc/g. Methods: Participants included 60 rural Zambian children with a mean age of 29 mo who were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 maize types (control, biofortified, or fortified) all of which were readily consumed (> 100 g on 1 d). <b>Total</b> <b>daily</b> zinc <b>intake</b> (from maize and low-zinc relish) was determined from duplicate diet collections. Multiplication by fractional absorption of zinc, measured by a dual isotope ratio technique, determined the <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> zinc absorption on the day the test meals were given. Results: The mean 6 SD <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> zinc <b>intake</b> (milligrams per day) from the biofortified maize (5. 0 6 2. 2) was higher (P < 0. 0001) than for the control maize (2. 36 0. 9). Intake of zinc from the fortified maize (6. 36 2. 6) did not differ from the biofortified maize. Fractional absorption of zinc from control maize (0. 28 6 0. 10) did not differ from the biofortified maiz...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} {{repeatability}} and relative validity of a Spanish beverage intake questionnaire for assessing water intake from beverages. The present {{analysis was performed}} {{within the framework of}} the PREDIMED-PLUS trial. The study participants were adults (aged 55 - 75) with a BMI ≥ 27 and &lt; 40 kg/m², and at least three components of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). A trained dietitian completed the questionnaire. Participants provided 24 -h urine samples, and the volume and urine osmolality were recorded. The repeatability of the baseline measurement at 6 and 1 year was examined by paired Student's t-test comparisons. A total of 160 participants were included in the analysis. The Bland-Altman analysis showed relatively good agreement between <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> fluid <b>intake</b> assessed using the fluid-specific questionnaire, and urine osmolality and 24 -h volume with parameter estimates of - 0. 65 and 0. 22, respectively (R² = 0. 20; p &lt; 0. 001). In the repeatability test, no significant differences were found between neither type of beverage nor <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> fluid <b>intake</b> at 6 months and 1 -year assessment, compared to baseline. The proposed fluid-specific assessment questionnaire designed to assess the consumption of water and other beverages in Spanish adult individuals was found to be relatively valid with good repeatability...|$|R
40|$|Sheep grazing metal-contaminated {{floodplain}} pastures across mid-Wales ingest {{high concentrations}} of lead (Pb) in vegetation and directly {{in the form of}} soil. Sheep whole blood analysis indicated that Pb concentrations can be significantly elevated for animals grazing contaminated sites: in winter/spring, a median blood concentration of 147 ?g Pb l? 1 was found at the location with the highest soil enrichment of this metal compared to only 26 ?g Pb l? 1 for the control flock. There was within-flock variability in blood?Pb concentration, and overlap between blood?Pb ranges in animals grazing control and contaminated sites, although use of the Kruskal?Wallis H test established a number of significant (P < 0. 05) differences between the blood?Pb content of flocks grazing the various study locations. Despite <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> <b>intakes</b> of up to 723 mg Pb d? 1, only one individual sheep showed a blood?Pb content above the ?normal safe? concentration of 250 ?g l? 1. Blood and wool analyses were found to have limited value for the diagnosis of environmental exposure to Pb, and further consideration of metal accumulation in offal, bone and muscle tissue is recommended.
