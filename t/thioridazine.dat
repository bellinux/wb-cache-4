25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} and distinctive clinical features of the disease is hypersensitivity to neuroleptic and antiemetic medications that affect dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. In the worst cases, a patient treated with these medications could become catatonic, lose cognitive function, or develop life-threatening muscle rigidity. Some commonly used medications that should be used with great caution, if at all, for people with DLB, are chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or <b>thioridazine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{and other}} {{antipsychotics}} with sedative properties such as promazine and <b>thioridazine</b> {{are among the}} most potent agents at α-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, they are also among the most potent antipsychotics at histamine H1 receptors. This finding is in agreement with the pharmaceutical development of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics as anti-histamine agents. Furthermore, the brain has a higher density of histamine H1 receptors than any body organ examined which may account for why chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine antipsychotics are as potent at these sites as the most potent classical antihistamines.|$|E

50|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1977, Crow compared three drugs (fluphenazine, chlorpromazine, <b>thioridazine)</b> with different tendencies to produce side effects, and was able to trace some of the anatomy of schizophrenia as well as shedding some light on what the differences between the drugs may mean. All three drugs are effective in controlling schizophrenic symptoms, but fluphenazine often causes motor side effects while chlorpromazine does less so, and <b>thioridazine</b> never does.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thioridazine</b> prolongs the QTc {{interval}} in a dose-dependent manner. It produces {{significantly less}} extrapyramidal side effects than most first-generation antipsychotics. Its use, {{along with the}} use of other typical antipsychotics, has been associated with degenerative retinopathies. It has a higher propensity for causing anticholinergic side effects coupled with a lower propensity for causing extrapyramidal side effects and sedation than chlorpromazine, but also has a higher incidence of hypotension and cardiotoxicity. It is also known to possess a relatively high liability for causing orthostatic hypotension compared to other antipsychotics. Similarly to other first-generation antipsychotics it has a relatively high liability for causing prolactin elevation. It is moderate risk for causing weight gain. As with all antipsychotics <b>thioridazine</b> has been linked to cases of tardive dyskinesia (an often permanent neurological disorder characterised by slow, repetitive, purposeless and involuntary movements, most often of the facial muscles, that is usually brought on by years of continued treatment with antipsychotics, especially the first-generation (or typical) antipsychotics such as <b>thioridazine)</b> and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic treatment). Blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis, leukopenia and neutropenia are possible with <b>thioridazine</b> treatment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thioridazine</b> {{is known}} to kill XDR-TB and to make MRSA {{sensitive}} to β-lactam antibiotics. A possible mechanism of action for the drug's antibiotic activity is via the inhibition of bacterial efflux pumps.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} that trifluoperazine is more effective for schizophrenia than lower-potency antipsychotics like chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, <b>thioridazine</b> and levomepromazine, but trifluoperazine appears to cause more adverse effects than these drugs.|$|E
50|$|Weight gain can be {{a problem}} for some, with {{quetiapine}} causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, risperidone, <b>thioridazine,</b> thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole.|$|E
50|$|Mesoridazine (Serentil) is a {{piperidine}} neuroleptic drug {{belonging to}} the class of drugs called phenothiazines, used {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia. It is a metabolite of <b>thioridazine.</b> The drug's name is derived from the methylsulfoxy and piperidine functional groups in its chemical structure.|$|E
50|$|Its {{primary use}} in {{medicine}} was {{the treatment of}} schizophrenia.
