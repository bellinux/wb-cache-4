500|$|Historian Deborah Gray White {{builds on}} Blassingame's {{research}} of the family life of the slaves in Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South (1985). Her argument is similar to Blassingame's: [...] "This present study <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> slave women in America and argues {{that they were not}} submissive, subordinate, or prudish and that they were not expected to be so." [...] White discusses the Mammy and Jezebel stereotypes often applied to African American women by white Americans. She calls The Slave Community [...] "a classic" [...] but remarks that [...] "Blassingame stressed the fact that many masters recognized the male {{as the head of the}} family. He observed that during courtship men flattered women and exaggerated their prowess. There was, however, little discussion of the reciprocal activities of slave women." [...] She concludes that Blassingame [...] "described how slave men gained status in the family, but he did not do the same for women." ...|$|E
