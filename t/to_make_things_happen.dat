We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116).

25|$|Practitioners {{traditionally}} {{believe that}} daily life depends on proper alignment {{and knowledge of}} one's ori. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean {{a portion of the}} soul that determines personal destiny and success. Ashe is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. Ashe is the power <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen.</b> It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Orisha devotees strive to obtain Ashe through iwa-pele or gentle and good character, and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others might call inner peace and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine energy that comes from Olodumare, the creator deity and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ashe is sometimes associated with Eshu, the messenger Orisha. For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the Orishas, and the ancestors.|$|E

Prior to the draft, Cherepanov attended the NHL's Scouting Combine, allowing club's to evaluate his physical attributes and schedule interviews, if they needed additional information prior to his selection. Those attending the combine were struck by Cherepanov's apparent physical immaturity, pointing out his low number of bench press repetitions, and his [...] physique. [...] His performance during the interview portion of the event was more impressive, with team personnel impressed with his maturity and good attitude. [...] At the draft, Cherepanov was selected by the New York Rangers {{in the first round of}} the draft, 17th overall. [...] Some attributed Cherepanov's lower draft selection to concerns about his availability for the NHL, considering the lack of a transfer agreement between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) concerning Russian players. [...] Analyst Pierre McGuire believed that Cherepanov was a legitimate NHL prospect, stating [...] "He was built for the new-age NHL with his speed, his skill and his ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> offensively."

Arranging to practice in the nets three evenings a week, under the direction ot these two fine Essex and England cricketers, seemed to be an excellent way in which to get noticed and known in Essex cricketing circles, especially as previously I had been playing my cricket outside the county.

The work presented in this research report offers a strong guide to how to carry these broad ambitions forward in a practical and effective way. The key findings confirm a central message that healthy communities don’t rely on health services. In many regional areas, these services are so rare that they can’t form {{an integral part of the}} fabric of regional communities.

40|$|Though Zambia is well {{endowed with}} natural resources, its {{agricultural}} sector is extremely underdeveloped, and {{almost half of}} the small-scale farmers do not even achieve food security. While internal political problems are a major cause for this, external disturbances such as climate change and economic shocks are additional threats to the sector. This study explores the main challenges and presents suggestions for resolutions based on empirical research. The e-voucher system, crop diversification and conservation agriculture belong to the bundle of suggested measures, which – when implemented together – could lead to pro-poor agricultural development. They would not only buffer climate and economic shocks but also increase income in a pro poor manner and show spill-over effects. Accompanied by suitable “software” measures at all levels in order to increase knowledge as well as adaptive and organisational capacity, farmers’ resilience can be comprehensively strengthened. However, political will and more commitment from all stakeholders, including the engagement of the private sector and the self initiative of farmers, are needed <b>to</b> really <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen...</b>|$|R

40|$|We tend {{to assume}} that great leaders must make {{difficult}} choices between two or more conflicting outcomes. In an interview study with 26 CEOs of top American and European companies (incl.

The study identifies five groups of practices that make this possible. Together, they reveal a systematic approach to managerial work at the top, which is seldom found in the literature. By building on the engagement of many {{in the development of}} the organization, the practices are important for our understanding of how a CEO facilitates the partaking of many in strategy making.
