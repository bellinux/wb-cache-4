50|$|Many {{species of}} Elaphe {{are known for}} being non-aggressive and shy. They are prone to freeze their {{movements}} when they are shocked or encountering danger. This motionless response has contributed to many road kills of Elaphe. However, some specific Elaphe {{tend to be more}} defensive if they are continually provoked. For example, <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta lindheimeri, are well {{known as one of the}} most snappy and combative <b>rat</b> <b>snakes.</b> In general, the defense system of Elaphe can be broken down to two levels. The first line of defense involves specific behaviors that Elaphe use to warn the intruders. One of the most common ways is by coiling their bodies and vibrating their tails, which simulates a rattle. Fox snakes, Elaphe vulpina and Elaphe gloydi, exemplify this type of defense mechanism: they mimic the rattling vibration of rattlesnakes when they encounter danger.Another common way of defense is by smearing a foul-smelling musk on their predators. The musk is originated from the contents of the anal gland and the intestinal tract.The second line of defense, generally involves striking the intruder with their teeth if they are further provoked.|$|R

We studied nesting success of Golden-cheeked Warblers (Dendroica chrysoparia) from 2005 - 2006 in urban and rural landscapes in central Texas. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate models representing hypotheses about effects of temporal, nest-site, nest-patch, edge, landscape, and urban factors on nest success. We found the most support for the model with temporal and edge effects and little support for other effects. The 25 -day period nest survival was 0. 374. We monitored 61 nests with cameras to identify urban nest predators. The period predation rate was 0. 541. Eight nests were depredated by <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> (Elaphe obsoleta lindheimeri), four by Western Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma californica) and two by Cooper's Hawks (Accipter cooperii), three by fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), and one by fire ants (Solenopsis sp.).

50|$|The <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> is {{a medium}} to large snake, capable of {{attaining}} lengths {{of four to}} five feet. They vary greatly in color and patterning throughout their range, but they are typically yellow or tan in color, with brown to olive-green, irregular blotching from head to tail. Specimens from the southern area of their range {{tend to have more}} yellow, while those from the northern range tend to be darker. One way to distinguish them from other rat snakes is they are the only ones with a solid grey head. Some specimens have red or orange speckling. The belly is typically a solid gray or white in color. The several naturally occurring color variations include albinos, high orange or hypomelanistic, and a few specimens which display leucism which have become regularly captive-bred and are popular in the pet trade. The <b>Texas</b> <b>Rat</b> <b>Snake</b> becomes very black with white spots in some specimens caught in Sabine County, Texas which reflects the northern intergrade of the black rat snake.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> has a {{voracious}} appetite, consuming {{large numbers}} of rodents and birds, and sometimes lizards, soft-bodied insects and frogs which they subdue with constriction.

They are often found around farmland, and will sometimes consume fledgling chickens and eggs, which leads them to be erroneously called the chicken snake.|$|E

Areas in and around the creeks are inhabited by the Guadalupe spiny softshell turtle, Red-eared slider, Alligator snapping turtle and Blanchard's cricket frog.

50|$|The <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> is {{relatively}} timid {{for such a}} large snake. However, they are extremely variable in temperament. Adults can be mild-tempered or aggressive - exhibiting mouth gaping and biting when approached. Juveniles {{less than a year}} old may either be very docile or bite when disturbed. One of their defensive behaviors involves 'rattling' or rapidly whipping the end of their tail back and forth against anything near by to create a rattling sound. They also have an awful smelling musk compared to other snakes. They eat readily in captivity and will eat thawed frozen mice and rats. Wild-caught specimens will generally eventually become tame in captivity.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{following}} snakes {{were located}} and acquired: two albino {{black rat snake}}s; one xanthlc black rat snake, one hypoplgmented black rat snake with phenotype not previ-ously described; one leucistic <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake,</b> one F, wild-type black rat snake heterozy-gous for albinism, and one male and two female F ^ wild-type Texas rat snakes heterozy-gous for albinism. Between 1975 and 1983 these snakes were subjected to various breed-ing combinations to determine their genetics. The results of 29 matings are summarized. All of the aberrant phenotypes {{were found to be}} autosomal recessive mutations. Allellc and nonallellc forms of albinism were found to exist in the black rat snake. The xanthlc form of hypopigmentatlon was found to be tyroslnase-positive partial albinism. Leucism In the <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> appears to be associated with bilateral exophthalmos in some in-stances. The previously undescribed black rat snake phenotype was designated "brlndle" because of its appearance. It appears to be a genetically determined alteration In the quantity or quality of pigment, or both, and it does not undergo ontogenetic loss of pattern. It is not a form of tyrosinase-positive albinism analogous to the xanthlc phenotype.

Nest failure is considered an important factor contributing to the decline of Golden-cheeked Warblers (Dendroica chrysoparia), yet relatively little is known of the extent of nest predation on this species. In April 1994 and 1995, 1 placed artificial nests, simulating those of Golden-cheeked Warblers, along 200 transacts at 5 study sites in Travis County, Texas. This study was designed to determine if differential levels of predation existed between nests placed in forest interior tracts or near habitat edges. A total of 508 of 794 nests (64 %) was depreciated. In {{all but one of the}} four trials, edge nests had depredation greater than interior nests; however, only the first trial of 1994 had a statistically significant difference (P = 0. 04). There does not seem to be a greater level of nest predation at the 10 -m habitat edge than in the 100 -m habitat interior. Predation levels seemed to vary with site location in the county, suggesting local habitat features may have contributed to predation levels to a greater extent than nest proximity to a habitat edge. Overall habitat-patch size also may contribute to levels of nest predation, as the largest two study sites had the lowest levels of nest predation. However, habitat-patch size did not correlate significantly with the level of nest predation for either year of my study. Avian predator abundance varied significantly (P = 0. 001) among study sites, but failed to explain differences in predation levels among sites. Using a remotelytriggered camera stationed at an artificial nest, I identified three nest predators: Western Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma californica), Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), and <b>Texas</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> (Elaphe obsolete). The results I present should be interpreted with caution. With few data on actual levels of predation on Golden-cheeked Warbler nests, comparison of the level of predation on my artificial nests to actual levels of predation remains difficult. Predation rates on my nests may relate more to the technique I applied than to actual rates of predation on Golden-cheeked Warbler nests. Further study of factors contributing to levels of nest predation in Golden-cheeked Warbler habitat is needed before drawing conclusions from these data...|$|E
