5|$|The {{original}} idea, {{known as}} The Un-Natural World was {{of an urban}} fox living in Brixton called Nelson, who was so used <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the city {{that he had lost}} any sense of being an animal. It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.|$|E

5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up <b>to</b> <b>Living</b> <b>in</b> the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E

5|$|In {{tropical}} {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier {{part of the}} year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> such areas.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E

5|$|Newsom {{attended}} Santa Clara University on {{a partial}} baseball scholarship and student loans, where {{he graduated in}} 1989 with a B.S. in political science. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but he threw his arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since. He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Jesuit approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome.|$|E
5|$|The early {{settlers}} in New Zealand cleared {{the bush and}} found their newly planted crops were invaded by hordes of caterpillars and other insects deprived of their previous food sources. Native birds were not habituated <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> close proximity to man so the common starling was introduced from Europe along with the House Sparrow to control the pests. It was first brought over in 1862 by the Nelson Acclimatisation Society and other introductions followed. The birds soon became established and are now found {{all over the country}} including the subtropical Kermadec Islands to the north and the equally distant Macquarie Island far to the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} is quite {{adaptable}} <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> captivity, and {{is common in}} zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 births had occurred in captivity, and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide. By 2001, 182 individuals were in North American zoos alone. As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world. Of these, 511 individuals of subspecies A. f. fulgens were kept in 173 institutions and 306 individuals of subspecies A. f. styani were kept in 81 institutions.|$|E

5|$|The {{specimen}} NIGP127587 was preserved {{with the}} remains of a lizard in its gut region, indicating that small, fast-moving animals made up part of the diet of Sinosauropteryx prima. Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as Sinosauropteryx. These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus Dalinghosaurus. Dalinghosaurus was probably a fast-running lizard adapted <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> open habitats, much like Sinosauropteryx itself.|$|E
5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a psychiatric clinic.|$|E
5|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Seneca Falls, Stanton {{had become}} an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
5|$|Young velvet bellies feed {{mainly on}} krill and small bony fish, {{transitioning}} to squid and shrimp {{as they grow}} larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins {{for dealing with the}} higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. Velvet bellies often carry a heavy parasite load. It is ovoviviparous, giving birth to litters of six to 20 young every two to three years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{enters the}} cave and is locked in. He escapes through another exit, and discovers a place used by Brian to escape his father. Henry goes deeper into the cave with the {{climbing}} equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's corpse {{at the bottom of}} a cavern, piled under rocks. Delilah is upset, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, a conflagration grows uncontrollably and an emergency evacuation order is given out to all lookouts. As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's signal to a cassette tape from Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because of climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, Ned admits <b>to</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the watchtowers, camp and the teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using radio equipment to deter Henry. Delilah states that a rescue helicopter is waiting for him at Thorofare Lookout and he treks there to find Delilah gone, having taken another helicopter. Using the radio equipment, he contacts her one final time and asks when he will see her again. She tells him to go back to his wife and Henry boards a helicopter heading home.|$|E
