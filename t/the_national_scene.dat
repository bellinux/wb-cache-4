5|$|The West Indies lodged an {{official}} complaint with Australia, and the Australian Cricket Board replied that it deplored the published comments, although noting that as O'Neill's touring contract had expired {{at the end}} of the tour, the point was moot. Nevertheless, the ACB changed its stance on players' writing, so that they could no longer comment on a tour until three months after its conclusion. The event is often perceived to have been a factor in O'Neill's eventual departure from <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene</b> when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E

He also {{competed in the}} 4×200-metre freestyle, where he broke the South American record {{with a time of}} 7:06:09, along with Rodrigo Castro, Thiago Pereira and Lucas Salatta.

5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time on <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene</b> was brief, but Democrats hoped that {{his reputation as a}} reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E
5|$|The King {{must have}} been {{impressed}} by Edington's performance, because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm, a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years. This was a job fraught with problems, as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid-1340s. The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of {{the early stages of}} the Hundred Years' War. By then reneging on his debts, the king had lost public confidence, and struggled to obtain new loans. Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer. This did not entail controlling the King's use of his resources– a move Edward would have resented greatly– but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses. By the early 1360s this was largely achieved; a testimony to the capabilities and energy of Edington as an administrator. In 1356 he was named chancellor, a post he held until his retirement from <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene</b> in 1363, possibly for health reasons.|$|E
