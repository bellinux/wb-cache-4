25|$|Anapaestic {{lines are}} usually {{based on the}} dimeter or quaternarius, that is a length of two metra, or four feet.

25|$|Similarly, every bivector can {{be written}} as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two {{orthogonal}} bivectors for this, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, {{there is only one}} way to decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique. The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.|$|E

This structure had some scholars label the system moraic instead of syllabic, because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda (i.e. CVn, CVm, CVng), a CVV syllable with complex nucleus (i.e. multiple or expressively long vowels), or a CCV syllable with complex onset (i.e. including a glide, CyV, CwV).|$|E

25|$|If the {{emitting}} and absorbing nuclei were in identical chemical environments, {{the nuclear}} transition energies would be exactly equal and resonant absorption would be observed with both materials at rest. The difference in chemical environments, however, causes the nuclear energy levels to shift {{in a few}} different ways, as described below. Although these energy shifts are tiny (often less than a micro-electronvolt), the extremely narrow spectral linewidths of gamma rays for some radionuclides make the small energy shifts correspond to large changes in absorbance. To bring the two nuclei back into resonance {{it is necessary to}} change the energy of the gamma ray slightly, and in practice <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> done using the Doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|Passing is {{the most}} basic and common thread used in goldwork; it {{consists}} of a thin strip of metal wound around a core of cotton or silk. For gold thread this is typically yellow, or in older examples orange; for silver, white or gray. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> attached by couching, either one or two threads at a time, and pulled through to the back to secure it. When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called bricking is used: {{the position of the}} couching stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall. This same type of thread is used in making cloth of gold.|$|E
25|$|In limited over matches (one innings matches), {{the team}} that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs {{with the loss of}} 1 wicket (250–1), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251–9), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar {{situation}} if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> quoted.|$|E

25|$|The diffusion-limited {{aggregation}} {{model has}} given simulated results which are closest {{in comparison to}} vascular trees in vivo. This model suggests that vascular growth occurs along a gradient of shear stress at the vessel wall, which results {{in the growth of}} vessel radii. Diffusion-limited aggregation proposes that an aggregate grows by the fusion of random walkers, which themselves walk along a pressure gradient. Random walk is simply a probability-based version of the diffusion equation. Thus, in applying this model to the vascular tree, small, resistant vessels must be replaced with large, conducting vessels in order to balance the pressure across the entire system. This model yields a structure which is more random at the tips than in the major lines, which is related to the fact that Laplacian formulations are stable when speed is negative with respect to pressure gradient. In major lines, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> so, but in small sprouts the speed fluctuates around 0, leading to unstable, random behaviour.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the start of the pre-season, yet {{prior to the start of}} the {{competitive}} season, the club opens its doors for free for all Feyenoord fans to have fun together and to present the squad for the upcoming season. De Kuip already opens in the morning when there are many activities around the stadium mainly for kids and promotional activities for companies which have a partnership with Feyenoord. Fans can also take a stadium tour and walk on the pitch. The activities inside the stadium itself normally start around noon, when there are several performances by various artists. Every year, the new Feyenoord ambassador of the year is announced at opening day. A minute of silence is held for all former Feyenoord players who have died and for known fans who have died in the previous year. Former Feyenoord players return to De Kuip every year to play versus a team of Dutch celebrities. The stadium activities end after the squad for the upcoming season is presented to the fans. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a special happening, mainly for the new signings of the team. They will be flown into the stadium with helicopters when a full stadium is cheering for them when they arrive. Once they are there, the other players and club officials enter the pitch one by one. Last but not least, all players are available for autograph sessions afterwards. Feyenoord's open day attracts approximately 60,000 to 70,000 fans towards Rotterdam, coming from all over the Netherlands, while there are only 51,117 seats available within the stadium. The opening day is known as a unique event in the Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|The {{first problem}} of {{measuring}} unpaid {{work is the}} issue of collecting accurate information. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> a concern in research studies, but is particularly difficult when evaluating unpaid work. [...] "Time-use surveys may reveal relatively little time devoted to unpaid direct care activities [...] the demands of subsistence production in those countries are great," [...] and may not take into account multitasking [...] for example, a mother may collect wood fuel while a child is in the same location, so the child is in her care while she is performing other work. Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work. Participant observation has been criticized for being [...] "so time-consuming that it can only focus on small numbers of households," [...] and thus limited in the amount of information {{it can be used to}} gather.|$|E
