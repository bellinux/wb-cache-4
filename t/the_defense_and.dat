5|$|While {{serving as}} dean in 1850, Holmes became a witness for both <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> {{prosecution}} during the notorious Parkman-Webster murder case. Both George Parkman (the victim), a local physician and wealthy benefactor, and John Webster (the assailant) were graduates of Harvard, and Webster was professor of chemistry at the Medical School {{during the time}} of the highly publicized murder. He was convicted and hanged. Holmes dedicated his November 1850 introductory lecture at the Medical School to Parkman's memory.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E

5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the season against Sewanee on Thanksgiving Day. In the first quarter, a trick play caught Sewanee off guard. On the previous play, Kuhn ran six yards out of bounds. Then, on a fake run, {{he threw a}} pass to Bomar, who was alone behind <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> <b>and</b> ran {{the rest of the}} way for a touchdown. Kuhn featured in a second-quarter scoring drive, completing a 10-yard pass to Scotty Neill inside the five-yard line and faking his way through the line for a touchdown. The Commodores won, 26–0; Kuhn was selected as an All-American by Billy Evans and received an honorable mention on Walter Camp's team. Kuhn and Centre's Flash Covington were the two quarterbacks from Evans' All-Southern team to receive Camp's mention. At the December 5, 1922 Vanderbilt football banquet, he was elected Commodore captain for the following season.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{position}} at Borodino {{consisted of a}} series of disconnected earthworks running in an arc from the Moskva River on the right, along its tributary, the Kolocha (whose steep banks added to <b>the</b> <b>defense),</b> <b>and</b> towards the village of Utitsa on the left. Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center (on the French side of the Kolocha) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult, aiding the defenders. The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt, a massive open-backed earthwork mounting nineteen 12-pounder cannons which had a clear field of fire {{all the way to the}} banks of the Kolocha stream.|$|E
5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a safety is scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by <b>the</b> <b>defense,</b> <b>and</b> then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently with CBS) called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E

In the team's final group match on November 18, Sauerbrunn helped the United States defeat Spain in a 1–0 victory. The United States was the only team to win all three of its group matches. In the quarterfinals, Sauerbrunn helped the United States advance with a 2–0 win over Australia. The United States moved into the semifinals, where Sauerbrunn started in the match against Germany on November 24. The Germans took the win and halted the United States' {{advancement}} in the tournament. The United States faced Brazil in the third place match, where Sauerbrunn played all 90 minutes.

On the next play, Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman committed a pass interference penalty, pushing the Hokies back 15 yards. Dwayne Thomas made good the penalty by gaining 16 yards on an option run, which {{was followed by a}} 17-yard pass from DeShazo to Freeman, who kept the Hokies' drive going with a first down at the Tennessee 39-yard line. After an incomplete pass, Thomas broke free for a 27-yard run along {{the left side of the}} field, giving Tech a first down at the Tennessee 13-yard line. Tennessee's defense held for three plays, forcing a fourth down. Instead of kicking a field goal, the Hokies attempted to convert the fourth down by running the ball. DeShazo scrambled, broke free of <b>the</b> <b>defense,</b> <b>and</b> crossed the goal line for the first Tech touchdown of the second half. Williams missed the extra point kick, however, and Tech cut Tennessee's lead to 3516 with 7:03 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
