500|$|In {{another letter}} to McKellar she {{describes}} how in just five days {{she wrote the}} 60,000-word book The River of Adventure, the eighth in her Adventure Series, by listening to what she referred to as her [...] "under-mind", which she contrasted with her [...] "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled {{with the lack of}} variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother [...] "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used to talk about them [...] "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens. Blyton had [...] "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" [...] but never knew the direction her stories would take. [...] Blyton further explained in her biography that [...] "If I tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>out</b> or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination." ...|$|E
2500|$|In autumn 1923, {{at the age}} of twelve, Mikhail Botvinnik {{was taught}} chess by a school friend of his older brother, using a home-made set, and {{instantly}} {{fell in love with the}} game. He finished in mid-table in the school championship, sought advice from another of his brother's friends, and concluded that for him it was better <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>out</b> [...] "concrete concepts" [...] and then derive general principles from these – and went on to beat his brother's friend quite easily. In winter 1924, Botvinnik won his school's championship, and exaggerated his age by three years in order to become a member of the Petrograd Chess Assembly – to which the Assembly's President turned a blind eye. Botvinnik won his first two tournaments organized by the Assembly. Shortly afterwards, Nikolai Krylenko, a devoted chess player and leading member of the Soviet legal system who later organized Joseph Stalin's show trials, began building a huge nationwide chess organization, and the Assembly was replaced by a club in the city's Palace of Labor.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Love {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Samantha Greaves of Examiner.com described the album as [...] "very diverse", listing [...] "Take Away Love" [...] as [...] "One of the gems on Lady Love" [...] and praised [...] "LeToya's ability <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>out</b> {{the box and}} to bring to R music something different than the vast majority". Meanwhile, Timothy Michael Carson of About.com praised LeToya's [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "soft soprano vocals", but wrote that [...] "many of the songs tend to sound alike" [...] and so [...] "Lady Love can quickly become a tiresome listen". Carson commented that [...] "LeToya's vocals are what kept [...] replaying the album over", lending particularly praise to the tracks [...] "I Need a U" [...] and [...] "Don't Need U" [...] – which he named [...] "LeToya's best recording to-date" [...] – before describing the album as a [...] "great listen". Nathan S. of DJBooth.net also gave a particularly favorable review of [...] "I Need a U", which he described as a [...] "breathy and burning track that should set the sheets on fire". Nathan also lent praise to LeToya's [...] "fierce personality" [...] on the [...] "remarkable" [...] "She Ain't Got...". However, he noted that [...] "Lady Love isn’t a perfect album" [...] and [...] "at times it feels uninspired and overly deliberate" [...] but wrote that [...] "it’s clearly {{the work of a}} woman coming into her own as an artist" [...] and so promised that he is [...] "not going to attach a “formerly of Destiny’s Child” onto LeToya Luckett’s name. She will finally be, simply, LeToya. She’s earned it". Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a more mixed review however, describing the album as being [...] "just as scattered and uneven as LeToya's self-titled debut", but noted that there are no [...] "shortage of high points", listing; [...] "Regret", the [...] "pummeling, startlingly brash" [...] "She Ain't Got..." [...] and [...] "the melancholy" [...] "Take Away Love" [...] as particular stand-outs. On the contrary, Diana Ayok of SoulCulture rated the album 3.5 out of 5, noting it as [...] "better and stronger than [...] first self titled album" [...] and heralded it as [...] "a genuinely impressive album" [...] that she [...] "would recommend" [...] "to any R lover".|$|E
