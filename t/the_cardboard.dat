5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and fogging on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture <b>the</b> <b>cardboard</b> pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E
5|$|The film {{included}} several technical errors.

Footage of a digital watch was spliced into the film, though this technology would not be invented for twenty-five years after the film's time period. There were other problems. Jacqueline Bisset developed laryngitis during the film's production. A set-piece for the film included a re-created version of a lighthouse at Incheon, but this was obliterated by a typhoon. The death of David Janssen during production called for extensive reshoots.|$|E

The first stage of the studies was a determination of the behaviours of the sandwich and its constituents, which passes by the definition of experimental protocols. Thereafter, an analytical model was proposed and permits to predict the homogenized behaviour of <b>the</b> corrugated <b>cardboard.</b> Finally a tool of decision-making aid was proposed...|$|R

25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} his discovery because Röntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, {{but this is}} a likely reconstruction by his biographers: Röntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. Röntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through <b>the</b> <b>cardboard</b> to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.|$|E
25|$|Microwave heating can be {{deliberately}} uneven by design. Some microwavable packages (notably pies) {{may include}} materials that contain ceramic or aluminium flakes, which {{are designed to}} absorb microwaves and heat up, which aids in baking or crust preparation by depositing more energy shallowly in these areas. Such ceramic patches affixed to cardboard are positioned next to the food, and are typically smokey blue or gray in colour, usually making them easily identifiable; <b>the</b> <b>cardboard</b> sleeves included with Hot Pockets, which have a silver surface on the inside, are {{a good example of}} such packaging. Microwavable cardboard packaging may also contain overhead ceramic patches which function in the same way. The technical term for such a microwave-absorbing patch is a susceptor.|$|E
25|$|Other {{items are}} made from {{materials}} such as wood, leather and paper. Wood items include furniture, toys and musical instruments, especially guitars and violins and include miniature musical instruments, which are made in San Joaquín. Leather is fashioned into belts, pistol holders, handbags, wallets and cowboy boots. These are mostly available in CadereytaLanda de Matamoros and San Vicente Ferrer in the municipality of El Marqués. Cardboard is used to fashion masks and items related to mojiganga theater mostly for use in parades and traditional festivals. Mojiganga figures are made with a reed frame to which <b>the</b> <b>cardboard</b> is applied. Bernal is noted for its masks made of paper and plaster which are often molded. In the city of Querétaro they make masks and mojiganga items, as well as large paper sculptures such as the Judas figures, which are burned.|$|E

25|$|After a {{redesign}} in 1983, the VIC-II was {{encased in}} a plastic dual in-line package, which reduced costs substantially, {{but it did not}} totally eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>cardboard</b> was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual in-line package, but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.|$|E
25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the focusing screen and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>cardboard</b> with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{supported this}} theory. During {{the investigation of}} Mrs. Muncey's murder, the doctor who performed the autopsy passed the vials to two local law enforcement officers who transported it to the FBI, where further testing occurred. The blood was contained in four vials, evidently with neither preservative nor a proper seal. The vials, in turn, were stored in a foam box, but nothing indicates the box was kept cool. Rather, in violation of proper procedure, the foam box was packed in the same cardboard box as other evidence, including House's pants and other clothing. <b>The</b> <b>cardboard</b> box was carried in the officers' car, and transported while they made the 10-hour journey from Tennessee to the FBI lab. Blood vials in hot conditions (such as a car trunk in the summer) can blow open. By the time the blood reached the FBI it had hemolyzed, or spoiled, due to heat exposure. By the time the blood passed from the FBI to a defense expert, roughly a vial and a half were empty, though the agent who had analyzed it testified he used at most a quarter of one vial. Blood, moreover, {{was found to have}} seeped onto one corner of the foam box and onto packing gauze inside the box below the vials.|$|E

Moreover, in order to assess the relevance of the homogenization method, a finite element model for three-point bending test is created.
