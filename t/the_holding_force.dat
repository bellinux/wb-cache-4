40|$|The {{results of}} the {{research}} of influence of <b>the</b> blank <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> and nonmonotonous process of deep drawing on the formability of low-carbon steel sheet with one-side galvanic coating of zinc are presented in this paper. Identification and influence assessment was done by monitoring: forming force, {{the distribution of the}} principal strains in the sheet plane and their relationship to the forming limit diagram, changes of thinning strain and drawing depth as the most significant technological indicator. Based on the analysis of test results, it was concluded that <b>the</b> blank <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> has a significant influence in terms of intensified friction in the flange. Also, in terms of a single-phase monotonous process, the applied type of variable blank <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> had a beneficial effect on the results of forming. A nonmonotonous two-phase process with uniaxial tension in the first stage greatly affects the behaviour of materials.

50|$|In defence, {{the same}} {{principles}} would apply. <b>The</b> <b>holding</b> group would be positioned forward of the main defensive lines. The job of <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> echelons in this event was to weaken or halt the main enemy forces. Should this be achieved, the enemy would be weakened sufficiently to be caught and impaled on the main defence lines. If this failed, and the enemy succeeded in sweeping aside <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>forces</b> and breaching <b>the</b> several main defence lines, mobile operational reserves, including tanks and assault aviation, would be committed. These forces would be allocated to holding and shock groups alike, and were often positioned behind the main defences to engage the battle worn enemy thrust.|$|R

5000|$|A {{vacuum chuck}} is {{primarily}} used on non-ferrous materials, such as copper, bronze, aluminium, titanium, plastics, and stone.

50|$|The {{friction}} in {{the flange}} region is mainly affected by blank <b>holding</b> <b>force.</b> Blank <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> {{is required for}} checking {{the amount of the}} metal flow in to the die.

50|$|In September, Bonaparte marched north against Trento in Tyrol, but Wurmser {{had already}} marched toward Mantua by the Brenta River valley, leaving Paul Davidovich's force {{to hold off}} the French. Bonaparte overran <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> at the Battle of Rovereto. Then he {{followed}} Wurmser down the Brenta valley, to fall upon and defeat the Austrians at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Wurmser elected to march for Mantua with {{a large portion of}} his surviving troops. The Austrians evaded Bonaparte's attempts to intercept them but were driven into the city after a pitched battle on 15 September. This left nearly 30,000 Austrians trapped in the fortress. This number rapidly diminished due to disease, combat losses, and hunger.|$|E

He led a brigade under Pierre Augereau in the Battle of Millesimo and under André Masséna at the Battle of Lodi. He also fought at the Battle of Castiglione in August. He soon attracted the special attention of Napoleon Bonaparte, who made him a general of division in December 1796, and repeatedly selected him for the command of important detachments. Thus, he led <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> in the Adige River valley at the Battle of Rivoli.

I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance. There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two, Lambourn joined the Red Cross and went to France, working in an {{ambulance}} unit {{as part of the}} British Expeditionary Force, in early 1940. Lambourn was subsequently assigned to a Field Dressing Station for <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> covering the retreat from Calais. He was severely wounded and evacuated on one of the last boats {{to take part in the}} Dunkirk evacuation and was subsequently mentioned in dispatches. In July 1940, Lambourn joined the British Volunteer Ambulance Corps and commanded a section. When his service with the Ambulance Corps ended, he painted a number of works at the Hawksley aircraft factory in Gloucester. These works included Test Pilots, a large composition which depicted numerous individuals. He also decorated the canteen at the factory and this led to a commission to join the newly formed Army Decorating Service to decorate canteens and rest centres for the Eighth Army. Often using prisoners of war as well as British troops as his labour force, Lambourn decorated canteens and other facilities as the Allies advanced through North Africa, Italy and then into Austria. During the advance, Lambourn made several paintings of the refugees he encountered and a small number of these works were purchased by the War Artists' Advisory Committee.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of rotary and linear inchworm-motors using piezoelectric actuators is presented. The motors' design {{has the advantage}} of a macro and micro stepper motor with high load and speed. The torsional design is capable of fast angular positioning with micro level accuracy. Additionally, the rotary motor, as designed, {{can be used as a}} clutch/brake mechanism. Constructed prototype motors of both types along with their characteristics are presented. The torsional motor consists of a torsional section that provides angular displacement and torque, and two alternating clamping sections which provide <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>force.</b> The motor relies on the principal piezoelectric coupling coefficient (d 33) with no torsional elements, increasing its torque capability. The linear motor consists of a longitudinal vibrator that provides displacement and load, and two alternating clamping sections which provide <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> <b>force.</b> This design eliminates bending moment, tension and shear applied to the actuator elements, increase its load capability and life. Innovative flexure designs have been introduced for both motor types. Critical issues that affect the design and performance of the motors are explored and discussed. Experiments are performed demonstrating the motor prototypes based on the aforementioned design considerations...|$|E
