People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision</b> based on their own values.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway would be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision.</b> However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods {{as well as a}} federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

25|$|Using the few {{scraps of}} {{reliable}} information within the various myths, Trevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia which is inhabited solely by Mentalics, {{to such an}} extent that every organism and inanimate object on the planet shares a common mind. Both Branno and Gendibal, who have separately followed Trevize, also reach Gaia at the same time. Gaia reveals that it has engineered this situation because it wishes to do what is best for humanity but cannot be sure what is best. Trevize's purpose, faced with the leaders of both first and the Second Foundations and Gaia itself, is to be trusted to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision</b> between the three main alternatives for the future of the human race: the First Foundation's path, based on mastery of the physical world and its traditional political organization (i.e., empire); the Second Foundation's path, based on mentalics and probable rule by an elite using mind control; or Gaia's path of absorption of the entire Galaxy into one shared, harmonious living entity in which all beings, and the galaxy itself, would be a part.|$|E
25|$|With {{the vote}} {{counting}} process underway and the AKP being projected {{to have lost}} their majority, Ahmet Davutoğlu appeared to accept the result and stated that {{the decision of the}} voters was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision.</b> Amid speculation over whether Davutoğlu would make a victory speech, Davutoğlu confirmed his intention to do so by travelling from his hometown of Konya to the AKP headquarters in Ankara, delivering a victory speech on the building's balcony. He claimed that the AKP would continue in delivering its programme and claimed that the AKP had won the election by virtue of winning the most votes. Davutoğlu's decision to give a victory speech was widely mocked on social media due to his lack of a parliamentary majority, with many commentators putting the speech down as being made for raising the morale of AKP activists. On 9 June, Davutoğlu and his government resigned out of protocol, with President Erdoğan accepting his resignation and requesting him to stay on as Prime Minister until a new government had been formed.|$|E

500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E

Suzette informed on how Nava took [...] "hours {{and hours of}} little stories {{of our lives and}} what we would do and how we felt." [...] Nava explained on how some stories [...] "had came out" [...] during his recording sessions with the family and published the first draft on March 4, 1996. The incident where Selena and Perez eloped was written in the draft which Abraham expressed disagreements on it. Citing the singer's popularity with children, he was concerned that they could get the wrong message about elopement as being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision.</b> Nava took a few days to persuade Abraham about the scene's content before he agreed to it, noting that Selena's elopement was a major part of her story. He further insisted that his character's embracement after the scene would shade a more positive tone after his earlier negative judgments on Selena and Perez's relationship in the film. Curious on how Nava found out about the elopement, Abraham asked the director and found out that he had interviewed Perez. Abraham discovered that Selena had coaxed Perez into elopement; with earlier assumption that Perez had pressured her into secretly getting married.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in terms}} of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, John Locke abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of [...] "common sensibles" [...] that are perceived. But then George Berkeley abandoned both. David Hume agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision.</b> But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of extreme skepticism. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion? ...|$|E
2500|$|Decatur {{immediately}} {{met with}} disaster. He had ordered gunboats as harbor pilots {{to mark the}} safe passage across the bar with anchored boats {{at the mouth of}} the harbor, but they failed to do so properly. President grounded on the bar and remained stuck there for almost two hours, enduring a pounding from the wind and heavy sea. Decatur claimed that by the time the frigate worked free it was heavily damaged: some copper was stripped away from the hull; the masts were twisted and some of them [...] "sprung," [...] i.e. had developed long cracks; and the hull was twisted and [...] "hogged," [...] i.e. the bow and stern sagged. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of the hogging when's when the ship was surveyed on its arrival in Britain, although damage to the copper and pintles was recorded. Furthermore, President's sailing performance was not hampered by the grounding as she managed to outsail every ship in the squadron including the fast Leda class frigate Tenedos, with the exception of Endymion which was considered the [...] "Fastest ship in the Royal Navy" [...] which logged speeds faster than the clipper ship Rainbow 1845. Furthermore, Endymion excelled in light winds such as those in which the chase was held. Although her accompanying vessels headed for safety, Decatur claimed it impossible for President to return to port as the gale was still blowing. The logs from the British squadron claimed the gale had stopped, though strong winds persisted. It was unlikely that the open [...] gunboats could have been safely put out to mark a passage if the gale had persisted also suggesting the gale had stopped. Decatur claimed was forced to put to sea. Whether he truly could not wait out the storm was not clear, but given the strong westerly winds, what appeared to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>decision</b> would be to put out to sea. He headed east, keeping close to the Long Island shore before heading southeast.|$|E
