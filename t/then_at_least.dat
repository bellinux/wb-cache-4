5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E

On a 9–6 vote, the council approved a measure that established the project's $124 million capital budget, its estimated $3.2 million operating and maintenance budget and its 2.5-mile route, which includes a lakefront spur connecting the line to the proposed $122 million, 44-story Couture. Construction on the Milwaukee Streetcar will start March 2017, with initial operation by mid-2018. The Lakefront service is expected to start operation by 2019.|$|E
25|$|One {{can also}} {{consider}} colorings {{of the plane}} in which the sets of points of each color are restricted to sets of some particular type. Such restrictions may cause the required number of colors to increase, as they prevent certain colorings from being considered acceptable. For instance, if all color classes are required to be Lebesgue measurable, {{it is known that}} at least five colors are required. In the Solovay model of set theory, all point sets are measurable, so this result implies that in this model the chromatic number of the plane is at least five. If a coloring of plane consists of regions bounded by Jordan curves, <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> six colors are required.|$|E

25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one of the bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E

The trains used the LD route via Pyewipe Junction. The fish train {{and most of the}} Lincolnshire Coast trains turned south off the LD at Clipstone East Junction to travel via Mansfield Central. The Yarmouth train and a few Lincolnshire Coast trains turned north at Langwith Junction to travel via Clowne South and Killamarsh South Junction, then to Sheffield Victoria or on to Manchester Central. The Summer holiday specials lasted until September 1964, so {{it is likely that the}} facilities at Pyewipe were used until <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>least.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis is seen {{to occur}} {{naturally}} in aphids, Daphnia, rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, {{as well as in}} many plants. Among vertebrates, strict parthenogenesis is only known to occur in lizards, snakes, birds and sharks, with fish, amphibians and reptiles exhibiting various forms of gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis). The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932. Since <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other, usually sexual, species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically and Komodo dragons; the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous parthenogenetic vertebrates. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.|$|E

25|$|The Chapultepec Zoo is {{the most}} visited {{attraction}} of the park, especially on Sundays. It is estimated that half of all park visitors come to the zoo. The zoo was established by Alfonso L. Herrera, a biologist, and opened in 1924. Herrera's intention was to reestablish the zoo tradition of the old Aztec emperors and improve upon it. He began with species native to Mexico and then added others {{from the rest of}} the world. He modeled the zoo after the Bioparco di Roma in Rome, Italy. Between 1950 and 1960, the zoo expanded and added new species. In 1975, the zoo obtained two pandas from China. Since <b>then,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> eight panda cubs have been born at the zoo, making it the first institution outside of China to breed the species. From 1992 to 1994, the zoo was completely remodeled, categorizing exhibits by habitat rather than type of species. Some of the most important Mexican species at the facility include a rabbit native to only a few volcanoes in Mexico, zacatuche (or teporingo), the Mexican wolf, ocelot, jaguar and ajolote. Today, it has 16,000 animals of 270 species, separated into four sections according to habitat: tropical forest, temperate forest, desert and grassland. About one third of the animals are native to Mexico.|$|E

500|$|One {{can define}} other number systems using {{different}} rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs {{would need to}} be reinterpreted and one might find that, in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of —rather than independent alternatives to— the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, it is worthwhile to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as [...] "0.999..." [...] is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one of the assumptions built into the system must break down.|$|E
