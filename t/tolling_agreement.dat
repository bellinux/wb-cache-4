40|$|In meeting its {{retail sales}} obligations, {{management}} {{of a local}} distribution company (LDC) must {{determine the extent to}} which it should rely on spot markets, forward contracts, and the increasingly popular long-term <b>tolling</b> <b>agreements</b> under which it pays a fee to reserve generator capacity. We address these issues by solving a mathematical programming model to derive the efficient frontier that summarizes the optimal tradeoffs available to the LDC between procurement risk and expected cost. To illustrate the approach, we estimate the expected procurement costs and associated variances that proxy for risk through a spot-price regression for the spot-purchase alternative and a variable-cost regression for the tolling-agreement alternative. The estimated regressions yield the estimates required to determine the efficient frontier. We develop several such frontiers under alternative assumptions as to the forward-contract price and the <b>tolling</b> <b>agreement’s</b> capacity payment, and discuss the implications of our results for LDC management...|$|R

Allowing for very general models for jump-diffusion processes with possibly time-dependant jump intensity, we study the control problem under the dynamic programming framework. After rigorously proving the dynamic programming principle, we define viscosity solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equation, and show the value is the unique solution of the equation.

40|$|In {{transmission}} and distribution separated electricity markets, with the highly fluctuant price, distribution companies need to purchase electric power reasonably in several energy markets such as spot markets, long-term <b>tolling</b> <b>agreements</b> and forward contracts etc. to realize profit maximum and risk minimum. Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) might measure risk efficiently, with only one kind of price distribution considered. In case of existence of more price distributions, e. g. logarithmic normal distribution, a method called weighted CVaR (WCVaR) to measure the purchasing risk of the distribution company is proposed in this paper. A mean-WCVaR model is built to measure the profit and risk in the purchasing process as a mathematical programming problem to derive the efficient frontier that indicates the optimal tradeoffs available to distribution company between expected revenue and purchasing risk in several energy markets. Lastly, a simulation case is carried out to prove {{the efficiency of the}} proposed model, which paves a new way for distribution company to determine the optimal purchasing strategies considering the risk. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Risk-adjusted {{valuation}} is {{well established}} in both theory and business practice. However, its implications are not always immediately apparent or intuitive in legal disputes such as breach of contract lawsuits. In particular, damages are often calculated by discounting the differences in cash flows between but-for (no breach) and actual (breach) worlds by a single discount rate. While widely used, this approach can produce incorrect valuation results. This paper provides {{a case study of}} a breach of an electricity <b>tolling</b> <b>agreement</b> to illustrate the more general valuation principle of discounting but-for and actual cash flows using two discount rates. ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{competitive}} electricity market with highly fluctuated electricity price, local distribution companies (LDCs) need to purchase electric power from several energy markets, such as spot markets, long-term <b>tolling</b> <b>agreements</b> and forward contracts, to maximize profits and minimize risks. Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) can measure risk efficiently, {{but only one}} kind of price distribution rule may be considered. In fact, the spot electricity price usually does not follow the normal distribution, {{and it might be}} shown as logarithmic normal distribution if there was no enough supply at peak load situation. In this paper, a novel WCVaR method-Weighted Conditional Value-at-Risk-is proposed to measure the purchasing risk of LDC with multiple purchase options, especially when the electricity price follows more than one distribution rules. The Mean-WCVaR model is built as a mathematical programing problem to derive the efficient frontier that indicates the optimal tradeoffs available to LDC between expected revenue and purchasing risk in several energy markets. The existence of optimal solution of proposed WCVaR model is proved mathematically. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed model. The proposed model provides a new method for LDC to determine the optimal purchasing strategies considering the risk. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The {{development}} of transport infrastructure {{is critical to}} boost the economic growth in developing countries. However, transport infrastructure is capital-intensive and public funds are limited. In this context, private sector participation {{should be encouraged to}} decrease the burden of the governments in terms of financing. Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world and its economy has been steadily growing during the last decade. Nevertheless, the country faces several challenges due to the underdeveloped and irregular distribution of transport infrastructure around the country. The Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's Economic Development (MP 3 EI) includes the construction of thousands of kilometers of roads. PPPs are expected {{to play an important role}} in the implementation of this Plan. In this sense, the government holds a proactive approach and as a result, a regulatory framework for PPPs has been established. The main objective of this dissertation is to determine whether toll road projects are economically and financially viable in Indonesia and, consistently define the most suitable financing schemes to be adopted. A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been conducted in order to assess the economic welfare gain, as well as to conclude whether this projects would be commercially feasible. One of the most attractive sections of the Trans Sumatra toll road, in terms of traffic forecast and initial investment, has been analyzed for this purpose. The relevant economic impacts have been identified, monetized, and discounted using a certain social discount rate to determine the economic performance. Moreover, all the financial outflows and inflows have been calculated and discounted using a certain financial discount rate to establish the cash flow streams. The economic and financial indicators obtained show that even toll roads socio-economically desirable are financially unfeasible. Hence, mixed financing schemes have been proposed including public incentives to attract private investors. A Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) agreement between public and private parties is considered the more appropriate model to develop toll roads in Indonesia. It is essential to identify the risks related to the project; paying special attention to which party – the public or the private sector – will be mainly responsible for the planning and implementation of the mitigation measures and the management of such risks. Several financing schemes with different initial investment distributions, responsibilities, and risk allocations have been proposed. The conclusion drawn is that major initial investment covered by the private or public party implies greater financial profitability for the private party and smaller incurred cost for the public party respectively. However, it should be considered that more responsibility and financial risk will be assumed too. Based on the proposed schemes, the {{development of}} toll roads in Indonesia would be commercially viable under BOT financing schemes sharing the initial investment between public and private parties and establishing shadow <b>tolls.</b> An <b>agreement</b> regarding the portion of initial investment covered by each party and the shadow tolls compensation should be clearly defined in the PPP contract...|$|R
