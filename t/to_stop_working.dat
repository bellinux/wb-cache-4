5|$|Further {{issues were}} {{discovered}} upon {{the launch of}} the Anniversary Update ("Redstone"), including a bug that caused some devices to freeze (but addressed by cumulative update KB3176938, released on August 31, 2016), and that fundamental changes to how Windows handles webcams had caused many <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Melua {{was ordered}} by her doctors <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> {{for a few}} months after {{suffering}} a nervous breakdown, resulting in her hospitalisation for six weeks. As a result, all touring and promotional activities were postponed until the following year.|$|E
5|$|Punk's matches with Cabana led him {{to being}} hired by the Ring of Honor promotion. From February 2003 until May 2004, Punk refused to wrestle for IWA Mid-South, {{explaining}} this as a protest to Ian Rotten's mistreatment of Chris Hero in the company. Hero, however, has stated he believes there were other reasons, and Rotten's treatment of him was just an excuse by Punk <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> for the company. Eventually Punk returned to IWA Mid-South and continued to perform as a wrestler and commentator for them until 2005 when he was signed to World Wrestling Entertainment. His last appearance in IWA Mid-South was on July 2, 2005 in which he competed in a 60-minute time limit draw against Delirious.|$|E
50|$|Malfunction of the {{verification}} mechanism can cause vital software <b>to</b> suddenly <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> until re-activated or patched. This {{can happen in}} response to detected changes of installed hardware, other software, of the operating system.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 November, 30,000 {{striking}} mining, {{railroad and}} textile workers demonstrated in Saint-Étienne. Armed with iron bars, {{they face the}} CRS, which was newly created by the Interior Minister, Jules Moch (SFIO), who also appealed to {{the army and the}} 11th Parachute Shock Regiment Shock (armed wing of the SDECEE) to break the strikes. The creation of these riot police was to ensure the loyalty of police [...] "relocating" [...] the maintenance of order (it uses of police from across the country, not just in the locations concerned, to quell the riots) [...] In the North, the military nevertheless ensured that they would intervene in cases of violence, refraining if miners are limited <b>to</b> <b>stopping</b> <b>working.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{controversial}} investigation, with journalist Tony Watson, {{exposed the}} activities of the Economic League, a privately financed organization set up <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> ‘subversives’ <b>working</b> in industry. The three programs led to the collapse of the organization. In 1990 he co-authored a book with journalist Mark Hollingsworth called The Economic League - The Silent McCarthyism.|$|R
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working.</b> When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the ex-boyfriend before {{learning}} that the Kurt's best friend is probably guilty. Veronica gets a disturbing phone call from Logan, so she tracks his cell phone, finding him gambling. Veronica and Logan have a fight before she learns that Keith had <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> for a client when Weevil hit a suspect; Keith feels required to fire Weevil. Veronica tells Weevil the news before {{she gives him a}} job fixing the Dean’s car. Veronica confronts the best friend, but he’s not the perpetrator, and Veronica suddenly realizes that Trish is. Veronica lies to Trish about what happened to Kurt in order to elicit a true reaction from her; this plan works, and Veronica learns that Trish took the playbook in order to get him off the team. However, she lost it in the process. Kurt, Trish, and Veronica track it down to the ex-boyfriend, who gave the plays to another team to spite the couple.|$|E
25|$|Henderson did {{not recover}} {{from the effects of}} the gas. He went back to teaching, but became blind in 1934 and was obliged <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working.</b> He {{remained}} in poor health {{for the rest of his}} life, and died in Greenlane Hospital, Auckland, on 14 November 1958.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a poll {{conducted}} Feb. 23–24, by Fox News and Opinion Dynamics found 60% of Americans believed military force {{will be necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Iran from <b>working</b> on nuclear weapons ...|$|R
50|$|In 1988 Benazir Bhutto came {{to power}} and {{following}} in the footsteps of her father she also began victimizing the Chaudhry family. Her government issued orders to all banks <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> issuing <b>working</b> capital <b>to</b> the industrial units owned by the Chaudhries, thus making them engineered defaulters. The family sought relief from the courts and continued their business on borrowings from the private sector.|$|R
50|$|In December 1988 he {{returned}} from a 19-month layoff to fight #1 heavyweight contender Evander Holyfield. Thomas looked rusty as he was outmatched over 7 rounds, after which he was pulled out of his corner. Long-time trainer Angelo Dundee advised Thomas <b>to</b> retire and <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> with him.|$|R
25|$|In nationalistic terms, the {{abolition}} of slavery also served as a moral triumph of France over England as seen {{in the latter half of}} the above quote. Yet {{the abolition}} of slavery did not allow for independence and did not persuade Toussaint Louverture until some time later <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> with the Spanish army.|$|E
25|$|In Oamaru, 225kilometres {{southwest}} of Christchurch, the earthquake caused {{part of a}} chimney on the St Kevin's College principal's residence to fall through the house, and caused the clock atop the Waitaki District Council building to stop at 4:36am. The earthquake also caused the Dunedin Town Hall clock and the University of Otago clocktower <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> in Dunedin, some 350km away from the quake epicentre.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} and tear glands have a {{radiation}} tolerance of about 30Gy in 2Gy fractions, a dose which is exceeded by most radical {{head and neck}} cancer treatments. Dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can become irritating long-term problems and severely reduce the patient's quality of life. Similarly, sweat glands in treated skin (such as the armpit) tend <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working,</b> and the naturally moist vaginal mucosa is often dry following pelvic irradiation.|$|E
5000|$|PWN AI {{exploits}} vulnerabilities in the AI systems <b>to</b> {{make them}} <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> or make wrong decisions. AI PWN takes AI as primary or assistant tool in hacking/ PWNing targets and leads {{it to make}} wrong decisions. Besides, the presentation will also influence the evaluation result and bonus.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Johnnie To hired {{his former}} {{assistant}} director Patrick Yau {{to direct a}} number of low-budget crime films for To's then-young company: The Odd One Dies, Expect the Unexpected and The Longest Nite. However, due to a difference in opinions and To questioning Yau's ability to put his creative vision into place, he took over, directing The Odd One Dies and The Longest Nite himself. The same happened again with Expect The Unexpected. <b>To</b> eventually <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> together with Yau.|$|R
50|$|The Mynachdy Colliery, {{located a}} little beyond Ynysybwl, {{was working on}} a small scale at the beginning, and it seems <b>to</b> have <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> by 1891. It was reopened by new owners in 1901, lasting until 1933 when its {{connection}} to the railway line was reduced in extent, finally closing in 1942. Beyond Mynachdy was Black Grove Colliery, using its railway connection from 1884 to 1895. It had a tramway on an inclined plane to reach the actual pithead on the hill.|$|R
25|$|For {{the next}} five years, Butler worked on the series of novels that later {{become known as the}} Patternist series: Patternmaster (1976), Mind of My Mind (1977), and Survivor (1978). In 1978, she was finally able <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> at {{temporary}} jobs and live on her writing. She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write Kindred (1979), and then finished the series with Wild Seed (1980) and Clay's Ark (1984).|$|E
25|$|When 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} {{problems}} generally regarded as minor. Consequences did not always result exactly at midnight. Some programs were not active at that moment and problems would only show up when they were invoked. Not all problems recorded were directly linked to Y2K programming in a causality; minor technological glitches occur on a regular basis. Some caused erroneous results, some caused machines <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working,</b> some caused date errors, and two caused malfunctions.|$|E
25|$|During 2008, {{a rolling}} {{programme}} of transmitter updates caused approximately 250,000 set-top boxes <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> altogether. Freeview had warned consumers {{in advance of}} the update, which was phased over a three-month period. The problem affected a specific range of older units, and was caused by an increased Network Information Table (channel list) exceeding the memory available in some set-top boxes. This {{had been part of the}} specification that was available and implemented in the very early OnDigital boxes, but not in those using the SetPal chip set. Affected consumers were advised to buy new set-top boxes.|$|E
5000|$|Ramesses V reigned for no {{more than}} 4 years, dying of {{smallpox}} in 1143 BC. The only monument attested to him is a stela near Gebel el-Silsila. The Turin Papyrus Cat. 2044 attests that during his reign the workmen of Set Maat were forced <b>to</b> periodically <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> on Ramesses' KV9 tomb out of [...] "fear of the enemy", suggesting increasing instability in Egypt and an inability to defend the country from what are presumed to be Libyan raiding parties.|$|R
5|$|Grandaddy {{was formed}} in 1992 by singer, guitarist and keyboardist Jason Lytle, bassist Kevin Garcia and drummer Aaron Burtch. The group was {{initially}} influenced by US punk bands such as Suicidal Tendencies and Bad Brains. Lytle was a former professional skateboarder, who had turned to music after a knee injury forced him <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> skating, <b>working</b> at a sewage treatment works to fund the purchase of equipment, {{and several of the}} band's early live performances were at skateboarding competitions.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the {{president}} and his Chief of Staff, Fletcher Coal, try to cover up the White Houses connection to Mattiece, afraid that it might endanger {{the president}}s re-election the next year. The president orders FBI chief F. Denton Voyles <b>to</b> temporarily <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> on the Pelican Brief and asks the more trusted CIA head Bob Gminski to conduct the investigation instead. They also send an agent to Mattiece to find out whether the statements in the brief are true, but Mattiece, who became practically insane in the past years, has the agent killed.|$|R
25|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, {{the rest of}} the cyclists (only 25 were still in race) took revenge on the Pélissier brothers. When they had to change bicycles, {{everybody}} else sped away from them. Henri Pélissier chased the rest, but was then ordered by Desgrange <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> together with other cyclists in his pursuit. In the end, Henri Pélissier had lost more than 35 minutes, and his brother Francis over three hours. The Pélissier brothers were angry at the organisation and left the race. Jean Alavoine won the stage, and Eugène Christophe became the new leader in the general classification.|$|E
25|$|Eventually Voschev joins a {{group of}} workers, {{all of whom are}} much {{stronger}} than him, a fact that Voschev attributes to his exhausting quest for truth. He learns that the group will be digging an enormous foundation pit in which they will later construct a housing complex for the country's proletarians. Voschev also works at a slower pace than everyone else except for one man, Kozlov, whom the others make fun of for masturbating so often. Safronov, the most politically active worker at the foundation pit, complains when managements tells them <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> for the day.|$|E
25|$|At 15, Cox {{became a}} regular at The Cavern Club, and remembered the long queues and violent {{competition}} {{for access to the}} Beatles. Although she got a kiss from Ringo, whom she called ‘Ritchie’ (for Richard), he did not immediately notice her among his numerous fans. All the Beatles were supposed to be officially unattached, for image purposes, and when Ringo started dating Cox, she was often threatened, and once scratched in the face by a vicious rival. She even had <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> as a hairdresser because of the threats. In September 1963, with her parents' permission, she travelled to Greece with Starr, McCartney, and Jane Asher.|$|E
5000|$|Brock's {{simultaneous}} {{involvement with}} Correct the Record, American Bridge, and Priorities USA raised legal questions, {{given that the}} first two groups work closely with Clinton's campaign while Priorities USA is legally prohibited from doing so. Brock claimed <b>to</b> have <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> directly with American Bridge, although its staffers continued to operate out of his office. Paul Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, considered complaining about Brock to the Federal Election Commission and Justice Department, charging that he was [...] "creating new ways to undermine campaign regulation." ...|$|R
25|$|At 16 he {{was mostly}} self-taught {{but at this}} point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence. He only {{followed}} the first four lessons and then had <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> because his <b>working</b> left him with little free time. But as he later said, the lessons proved very useful in improving his style.|$|R
50|$|Frances, the new inmate at Whitehead, befriends {{a circle}} of inmates, and {{together}} they rebel against the prison’s abuse and exploitation. After several failed attempts <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the harsh <b>working</b> conditions along with the rape and death of their friend Lil’ Mama, Frances and the other inmates decide to take action and take control over the prison <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the abuse and stand up for their rights.|$|R
25|$|Demolition of Ungdomshuset {{began at}} 8 am on 5 March 2007. A {{demolition}} crane started its {{work at the}} back of the house with the top floor. The logos on the crane were covered and workers wore masks to conceal their identity. The union representing Ungdomshuset was on the ground trying to persuade the workers <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> and reveal the company they were working for. At 10am the Danish Working Environment Authority (Arbejdstilsynet) had the demolition interrupted due to reported concerns about dust and the potential presence of asbestos. The demolition resumed at 11am. At 4pm, about one-third of the house had been removed. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website.|$|E
25|$|Of 90,000 miners in the Jiu Valley, 35,000 decided <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> on {{the evening}} of August 1. Those at Lupeni were {{immediately}} joined by their fellow miners from nearby locations such as Uricani, Paroșeni, Aninoasa and Petrila. A list of 17 demands, approved by the strikers as a body, was drawn up by the strike leaders, Ioan Constantin (Costică) Dobre (b. 1947) and Gheorghe Maniliuc, who were aided by Dumitru Iacob, Ion Petrilă, Dumitru Dumitrașcu, Mihai Slavovschi the engineer Jurcă and the Amariei brothers. They requested that President Nicolae Ceaușescu personally come to Lupeni to receive their demands and negotiate with them. Speeches containing demands were made and the Valley {{was in a state of}} maximum tension.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would {{have to look for}} a job or education. If {{at the end of the}} year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.|$|E
5000|$|Referring to the {{intention}} to reduce the plutocratic influence of the [...] "Sugar Daddies", UEFA President Michel Platini said, [...] "If you buy a house, you have a debt but that doesn't mean someone is going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> you from <b>working.</b> If you depend only on a rich benefactor however, then the financial model is too volatile." ...|$|R
50|$|A conniving {{salesman}} named Giffen sells a {{glue that}} will stick <b>to</b> anything, but <b>stops</b> <b>working</b> after four hours. After getting many innocent townspeople to buy it, he leaves town {{in his truck}} before they can track him down for cheating them, then meets {{a man who has}} invented a box that can make people fly into the sky. Attempting to try it for himself leads to the biggest mistake of his life.|$|R
50|$|Edgar Sampson {{became a}} student of the Schillinger System in the early 1940s. He {{continued}} to play sax through the late forties and started his own band (1949-1951). In the late forties through the fifties he worked with Latin performers such as Marcelino Guerra, Tito Rodríguez and Tito Puente as an arranger. He recorded one album under his own name, Swing Softly Sweet Sampson in 1956. Due <b>to</b> illness, he <b>stopped</b> <b>working</b> in the late sixties.|$|R
