5|$|By now the German 346th Infantry Division {{had reached}} the area from its base at Le Havre. Their first attack, by the 744th Grenadier Regiment, was against the 1stSpecial Service Brigade. Attacking in strength, they were near to {{breaking}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> when No. 3 Commando counter-attacked and drove them back.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 10 in a stage. For all stages, the win earned 15points, second place earned 12points, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th. Points towards the classification could also be achieved {{at each of the}} intermediate sprints; these points were given to the top three riders <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> with 5points for first, 3 for second, and 1 point for third.|$|E

5|$|The first Allied {{attempt to}} break through the Gustav Line in the Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944 met with early success, with the British X Corps {{breaking}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> held by the 94th Infantry Division and imperilling the entire Tenth Army front. At the same time, Kesselring was receiving warnings of an imminent Allied amphibious attack at Anzio. Kesselring rushed his reserves, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions, to the Cassino front. They were able to stabilise the German position there but left Rome poorly guarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his own, on unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E
5|$|The three cruisers {{were able}} to pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of drifters, and at 03:30 began attacking the small barrage ships. The Austro-Hungarians {{frequently}} gave the drifter crews warning to abandon ship before opening fire. In some instances, the drifter crews chose to fight: Gowan Lee returned fire on the Austo-Hungarian ships. The ship was heavily damaged, but remained afloat; her captain—Joseph Watt—was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the classification, cyclists {{received}} points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. For stages, 1, 2 and 4 the win earned 25points, second place 22, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, sixth 14, seventh 12, eighth 10, ninth 8 and tenth 6. For stages 5, 6, 7 and 8 the win earned 15points, second place 12, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and 1 point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th.

5|$|Following this, the 15th Battalion {{moved to}} Mouquet Farm, where they {{supported}} {{an attack by}} the 14th Battalion and carried out defensive duties. They remained there until early September, when they were withdrawn back to Warloy and then to Reingheist, via Doulens. Before this occurred, on 30 August, the 15th experienced a change in command, as Cannan, who had been promoted to brigadier-general, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Terence McSharry. The remainder {{of the year was}} spent in the Ypres salient, around St Eloi and Boorlartbeek, before winter fell on the Western Front. It was the worst winter in Europe in 40 years, and the men suffered heavily from sickness and the cold as they rotated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> conducting defensive duties and labouring before moving to Gueudecourt, and then later Lagnicourt, in the new year.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the season against Sewanee on Thanksgiving Day. In the first quarter, a trick play caught Sewanee off guard. On the previous play, Kuhn ran six yards out of bounds. Then, on a fake run, {{he threw a}} pass to Bomar, who was alone behind the defense and ran {{the rest of the}} way for a touchdown. Kuhn featured in a second-quarter scoring drive, completing a 10-yard pass to Scotty Neill inside the five-yard line and faking his way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for a touchdown. The Commodores won, 26–0; Kuhn was selected as an All-American by Billy Evans and received an honorable mention on Walter Camp's team. Kuhn and Centre's Flash Covington were the two quarterbacks from Evans' All-Southern team to receive Camp's mention. At the December 5, 1922 Vanderbilt football banquet, he was elected Commodore captain for the following season.|$|E

50|$|Grant's Adjutant-General, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Seth Williams, brought Grant's first {{message to}} Lee for {{delivery}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> by General Humphreys's staff at about 8:30 p.m.|$|R
60|$|Fergus wrote {{a note to}} {{the general}} of the division, and Karl {{returned}} with a pass authorizing Count Eulenfurst's carriage to pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> at any time.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Auburn's Moon Ducote broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{toward the goal}} with {{blocking}} by Pete Bonner and William Donahue. After Guyon dove at Ducote and missed, Guyon gave chase and tackled him at the 26-yard line. For Auburn's only score Ducote circled around end for 17 yards and lateraled to Donahue, who ran down the sideline for a six-yard touchdown. Guyon was {{the star of the}} game, accounting for four touchdowns and having his best day passing. Strupper had touchdown runs of 62 and 50 yards. Auburn was considered a strong team, despite the lopsided score; Ducote and Bonner were the only non-Tech, unanimous All-Southern selections. Tech's starting lineup was Fincher (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Mathes (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Carpenter (right tackle), Bell (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Guill (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans Pareil, engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> behind Sans Pareil and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|Strupper {{scored the}} second {{touchdown}} {{on a short}} drive set up by his 40-yard punt return. Early in the second quarter, Strupper shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for 70 yards and the third touchdown. Tech's fourth touchdown required considerable effort and a methodical drive, ending in a 15-yard dive for a touchdown by Strupper. End runs by Guyon and Simpson's line plunging set up the fifth (and final) touchdown with Guyon's 6-yard run. Strupper ran for 198 {{yards and three touchdowns}} on nine carries. Tech's starting lineup was Bell (left end), Fincher (left tackle), Thweatt (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Rogers (right tackle), Carpenter (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Armsley (fullback).|$|E

50|$|As of 28 May, {{air raids}} and {{artillery}} strikes continued against rebel <b>lines</b> on <b>the</b> {{outskirts of the}} city, but government forces were still unable to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

5|$|Unable to {{continue}} the attack, and with a shortage of ammunition and rations, the division was ordered to withdraw back to the River Jordan. The brigade was ordered at 18:00 to retire back to Ain Es Sir. On arrival the 1st Squadron formed a defensive line, {{while the rest of}} the regiment rested. However, the 1st Squadron were soon engaged by a Turkish force, and the regiment and the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved up to support them. For the remainder of the night, the division retired <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> held by the regiment, until 04:00 on 1 April when the Wellington Mounted Rifles took over from the regiment, which then followed the division back to the river. They reached the Jordan Valley at dusk and moved back across the river. During the operation, the regiment lost eighteen dead, thirty-seven wounded and one man missing in action.|$|E
5|$|In early 1918, {{after the}} {{capitulation}} of Tsarist Russia the Germans, having moved {{the bulk of}} their forces to the Western Front, launched the Spring Offensive, striking against the British forces in the Somme. The initial onslaught pushed the Allied forces back and the Australian divisions, which had been merged into the Australian Corps, were thrown into the line in an effort to stem the tide. In early March, the 11th Battalion moved to the Hollebeke sector, where they were subjected to gas attacks before being sent south to Amiens at the start of April, joining the rest of the 1st Division in defence of Hazebrouck {{in the middle of the}} month. For the next couple of months the battalion rotated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in a defensive role as the German offensive was blunted. In June, as the Allies sought to regain some of the initiative, they undertook a series of Peaceful Penetration raids. On 2 June, the 11th Battalion attacked Mont de Merris, which resulted in the capture of a large amount of German equipment and over 200 prisoners for the loss of 16 men killed and 74 wounded. A lesser attack was launched on the German trenches opposite the battalion on 22 June. Around this time, a small group of US soldiers was attached to the 11th Battalion to gain experience. The following month, the battalion captured Gerbedoen Farm before supporting the 10th Battalion's successful attack on Merris.|$|E
5|$|Late in the fourth, Mark Ingram lost {{a fumble}} {{for the first}} time in his collegiate career, giving Tennessee {{possession}} at the Alabama 43 with 3:29 remaining in the game. The Vols drove the ball 43 yards in 2:10, culminating with an 11-yard Crompton touchdown pass to Gerald Jones to cut the gap to 12–10. The Vols followed with a successful onside kick attempt and regained possession of the ball at their own 41-yard line. After Tennessee was penalized five yards for a false start, Crompton completed a pass to Luke Stocker for 23 yards, to the Bama 27-yard line. With the clock ticking off the final seconds and Tennessee out of time outs, Crompton spiked the ball to stop the clock with four seconds left. This set up Lincoln for a 45-yard field goal attempt to win the game. However, Terrence Cody knocked his blocker over and broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> He blocked Lincoln's field goal as time expired, preserving Alabama's 12–10 victory and perfect season. For their performances, Cody was named the SEC Defensive Lineman of the Week and Tiffin was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.|$|E

25|$|As night fell, the Gate Pā garrison, {{assuming}} the site would be stormed the next morning, evacuated their position, passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of <b>the</b> 68th Regiment and fleeing across surrounding swamps before dispersing.|$|R
25|$|A few {{survivors}} {{emerged from}} hiding shortly afterwards and returned <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> to nearby Malmedy, where American troops still held the town. Eventually, 43 survivors emerged, some {{who had taken}} shelter with Belgian civilians.|$|R
5|$|The Union flanks {{were being}} pushed back, but not decisively. Hardee and Polk caused Sherman and McClernand on the Union right to retreat in the {{direction}} of Pittsburg Landing, leaving the right flank of the Hornet's Nest exposed. Just after Johnston's death, Breckinridge, whose corps had been in reserve, attacked on the extreme left of the Union line, driving off the understrength brigade of Col. David Stuart and potentially opening a path into the Union rear and the Tennessee River. However, the Confederates paused to regroup and recover from exhaustion and disorganization, then followed the sounds of the guns toward the Hornet's Nest, and an opportunity was lost. After the Hornet's Nest fell, the remnants of the Union line established a solid three-mile (5km) front around Pittsburg Landing, extending west from the river and then north, up the River Road, keeping the approach open for the expected, although belated, arrival of Lew Wallace's division. Sherman commanded the right of the line, McClernand took the center, and on the left, the remnants of W. H. L. Wallace's, Hurlbut's, and Stuart's men mixed with thousands of stragglers who were crowding on the bluff over the landing. The advance of Buell's army, Col. Jacob Ammen's brigade of Bull Nelson's division, arrived in time to be ferried over and join the left end of the line. The defensive line included a ring of more than 50 cannons and naval guns from the river (the gunboats USS Lexington and USS Tyler). A final Confederate charge of two brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Withers, attempted to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> but was repulsed. Beauregard called off a second attempt after 6 p.m., as the sun set. The Confederate plan had failed; they had pushed Grant east to a defensible position on the river, not forced him west into the swamps.|$|E
25|$|The great Dungan revolt (1862–1877) {{involved}} insurrection {{among various}} Muslim ethnic groups. It {{broke out in}} 1862 in Gansu then spread rapidly to Dzungaria and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of towns in the Tarim Basin.|$|E
25|$|In early 1932, {{there were}} plans to reduce annual grants {{of the line}} by NOK1 million, which would delay opening from the planned 1934 to 1936.
