5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, his {{management}} skills {{led to his}} recruitment by the UERL, which was struggling through a financial crisis <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> its existence. He quickly integrated the company's management and used advertising and public relations to improve profits. As {{managing director of the}} UERL from 1910, he led the take-over of competing underground railway companies and bus and tram operations to form an integrated transport operation known as the Combine.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, after {{recovering}} from an arm injury <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> {{to end his}} career, Mustaine became a born again Christian. Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaine's announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his new identification as a Christian. In May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with extreme metal bands Rotting Christ and Dissection due to the bands' anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its history, Norwich City has survived a number of {{incidents}} <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> its survival, including ousting from amateur football, {{the need to be}} re-elected to The Football League and financial crises. Geoffrey Watling, who was to become club Chairman and after whom a stand at the club's stadium, Carrow Road is named, was instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, both in the 1950s and 1990s; his father had played a similar role in 1919.|$|E

5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1926 and March 1927 Peng campaigned in Hunan, {{participating}} in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan. Under general Ho Chien(何键), Peng participated in the Battle of Fengtai, in which Kuomintang forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu. In 1927, Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left-leaning Kuomintang government in Wuhan <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. Tang Shengzhi, who Peng served under, aligned himself with Wang, and Peng was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and regimental commander. After Tang's forces were decisively defeated by Chiang, Peng commanded the rear guard, protecting the retreat of Tang's forces back into Hunan.|$|E
5|$|Bose {{commented that}} Ganguly's {{greatest}} legacy {{lay in his}} influence on the younger and budding generation of cricketers. Ganguly felt that every young player should play two years of domestic cricket before being selected for international assignments. He also said that every newcomer should be given at least five games to prove himself. Later he explained that being at {{the receiving end of}} an unfair decision against him, <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> to ruin his international cricket career, it enabled him to understand the insecurities of other newcomers in the team better than his predecessors. Ganguly had always backed the influence and contribution of younger players of the team.|$|E

5|$|By 1759, Prussia {{had reached}} a {{strategic}} defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted their forces into western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, a move <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland pursued former Steelers {{coach and}} Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli {{for the head}} {{coaching}} job. The team, however, hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009. Before {{the start of the}} season, Mangini and the front office traded Winslow to the Buccaneers after five seasons marked by injuries and a motorcycle crash <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> to end the tight end's career. The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini's first year, finishing 5–11 in 2009. While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games, the team won the final four games of the season, including a 13–6 victory over the rival Steelers.|$|E
5|$|Following the Plitvice Lakes {{incident}} of 1 April 1991, SAO Krajina forces captured three Croatian policemen from nearby Drniš, {{with the intention}} of exchanging them for Croatian Serb troops taken prisoner by the Croatian forces at the Plitvice Lakes. In turn, the militia established by the residents of Kijevo captured several Serb civilians and demanded that the captured policemen be released in exchange for their prisoners. On 2 April, JNA intelligence officers reported on this, and warned how local militias in Kijevo and Civljane, otherwise separated by barricades, were engaged in armed skirmishes <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> to escalate. Kijevo became strategically significant because its location hindered SAO Krajina road communications.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic {{hurricane}} <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> Bermuda {{but remained}} at sea during early September 2005. The fourteenth named storm and seventh hurricane {{of the annual}} Atlantic hurricane season, Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and initially moved very slowly to the northeast. Early forecasts suggested a possible threat to the island, but Nate passed well to its south as a Category1 hurricane on September 8. After {{moving away from the}} island, the storm entered a region with cooler sea surface temperatures and unfavorable wind shear, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical on September 10. The extratropical remnant was later absorbed by a larger weather system.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> the Baja California peninsula during October 2012. The sixteenth tropical cyclone, tenth hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the season, Paul originated from a trough of low pressure west of the coastline of Mexico on October13. While turning towards the north, the system quickly organized, reaching hurricane status {{on the afternoon of}} October15. By that afternoon, Paul had reached its peak intensity as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h), but began to weaken rapidly thereafter due to land interaction and strong wind shear. Late on October17, Paul degenerated into a remnant low. The remnants of Paul later moved ashore along the central Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In a December 26 practice, Virginia Tech linebacker Myron Newsome {{suffered}} an ankle injury <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> {{to force him}} to sit out the Orange Bowl. Newsome, who had been a starter during the regular season, eventually recovered to participate in the game, but his injury was a point of media interest in the days prior to kickoff. Two other Virginia Tech defenders were injured during practice prior to the game. Cornell Brown suffered a minor leg injury, while defensive end John Engelberger broke his nose.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald's {{five years}} in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive {{increase}} in Canada's naval forces and {{played a key role}} in a political crisis <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, a political leader whom Macdonald grew to loathe. When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.|$|E
5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic industry <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10billion Francs.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{attended}} dancing academies {{and became}} {{well known for}} her self-styled interpretive dancing skills, traveling across Europe with Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal. Riefenstahl often made almost 700 Reichmarks for each performance and was so dedicated to dancing that she gave filmmaking no thought. She began to suffer a series of foot injuries that led to knee surgery <b>that</b> <b>threatened</b> her dancing career. It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ("The Mountain of Destiny"). She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows.|$|E
