40|$|Abstract The article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the evolution of scientific concepts on <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process. Two main approaches to <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process are presented: linear and non-linear, and their distinctive features are defined. Within each approach the main types of models of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process are considered. The stages of formation and development of a linear model of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process are reviewed. Analyzed the influence of various factors on the occurrence of non-linear models of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process. Highlighted <b>the</b> advantages and disadvantages of linear and non-linear approaches to the development of models of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process. <b>The</b> effect of trends in the localization of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process in <b>the</b> current models of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process are studied. The modeling of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process at <b>the</b> present stage is proposed to be considered as a complex, interactive, nonlinear localized learning process...|$|R

5|$|The first {{football}} {{club in the}} UK was Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857. Early Northern football teams tended to adopt the Sheffield Rules rather than the Football Association Rules, but the two codes were merged in 1877. Many of <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> of Sheffield Rules {{are now part of}} the global game, including corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls.|$|E
5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday Night Football gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the Big Three television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> of Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried, Farsari further {{developed}} the trade in photograph albums. His studio generally produced sepia monochrome albumen prints that were hand-coloured and mounted on album leaves. These pages were often hand decorated and bound between covers of silk brocade or lacquer boards inlaid with ivory, mother-of-pearl and gold. Like his contemporaries, Farsari usually captioned and numbered his photographs in the images, often in white lettering on a black background.|$|E

40|$|The {{context of}} {{financial}} services has been characterised {{by changes in}} the regulatory, technological and societal landscape. Consumers are increasingly interested in mobile payments, crowdfunding and microfinance services, either for themselves or because collaborative consumption {{is viewed as a}} more sustainable. Retail branches are re-organised to further meet the expectations of customers, start-ups focusing on technology for financial services (i. e. Fintech) are ever growing and financial services companies reinforce their own innovation practices (e. g. creation of innovation labs or venture capital investment funds). <b>The</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem around financial services companies represents the many actors with whom they can co-create and co-produce innovative new services for their customers (or for themselves). <b>The</b> <b>innovation</b> process is no longer a closed internal effort but needs to include external actors from <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem. This topic is especially interesting in a small and open economy where the financial centre takes a prominent place in the economy. The research question is therefore “How does <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem influence <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process within financial services companies?”. The influence of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem on <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process within financial service companies mainly comes from its social capital and value creation efforts. However learning to work and exchange in an innovation ecosystem is also expected to influence <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> process in place. Realizing the potential of <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem requires sufficient capabilities to manage new information coming from <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem. <b>The</b> professional associations provide the necessary coordination among actors in <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem to co-create and appropriate value, while fostering co-evolution within <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem...|$|R

5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> {{attributed}} to Andriamanelo were not his personal invention. Rather, their origins {{can be traced}} back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers. Similarly, archaeological evidence proves the existence of iron implements in Madagascar at least four centuries prior to the war between Andriamanelo and the Vazimba, suggesting that while the technology was not discovered during his reign, Andriamanelo may have been among the first sovereigns in Imerina to make wide-scale use of it in military campaigns.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> of the Dewey Decimal {{system was}} that of {{positioning}} books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>innovations</b> of Andriamasinavalona were {{numerous}} and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and {{was responsible for}} introducing {{the tradition of the}} red parasol as an indicator of royalty; he also decreed that all women had the right to choose their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine.|$|E
30|$|The winner-take-all {{logic is}} challenged: <b>The</b> <b>innovation</b> {{ecosystem}} {{is characterized by}} its openness to the public, {{which means that the}} differentiation of resources and complementary innovations are pursued. In <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem, members make use of their complementary advantages to push <b>the</b> <b>innovation.</b> Meanwhile, they are able to share resources in <b>the</b> <b>innovation</b> ecosystem to reach a “win-win” result based on efficient interactions and internal benign competition.

There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|While the Lingbao {{school did}} not survive as a {{distinct}} entity, its ritual apparatus did, and it forms the basis for present-day Daoist ritual practice. In addition, many of <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> introduced by the Lingbao School have survived to the present, including its division of the Daozang into three sections corresponding to different teachings, with the Dongzhen corresponding to the Shangqing School, the Dongxuan to the Lingbao School, and the Dongshen to the Sanhuang teaching. The integration of Buddhism within Lingbao practices and beliefs ensured that Buddhist elements would remain {{an important aspect of}} later Daoism, and also aided in integrating Buddhism into all levels of society in China.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael Sittow both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed {{to the spread of}} the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.|$|E

5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> in {{business}} {{caused by the}} use of the nickel in coin-operated machines was the automat, in which patrons would serve themselves by inserting a coin (initially a nickel, though by the 1950s a higher denomination was needed) into a mechanism, turning a handle, and removing a sandwich or dessert. These restaurants were first established in Germany, but were popularized in the United States by, among other firms, Horn & Hardart. A type of business which took its name from the coin was the nickelodeon cinema, where a nickel bought admission to view a series of one-reel short films, generally about 12minutes in length, which ran continuously from early afternoon until late at night, with the patron free to remain as long as he liked. Although another denomination gave the penny arcade its name, the nickel was commonly used there as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|Indiana became {{politically}} {{influential and}} {{played an important}} role in the Union during the American Civil War. Indiana was the first western state to mobilize for the war, and its soldiers participated in almost every engagement during the war. Following the Civil War, Indiana remained politically important as it became a critical swing state in U.S. Presidential elections. It helped decide control of the presidency for three decades. During the Indiana Gas Boom of the late 19thcentury, industry began to develop rapidly in the state. The state's Golden Age of Literature began in the same time period, increasing its cultural influence. By the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong manufacturing state and attracted numerous immigrants and internal migrants to its industries. It experienced setbacks during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Construction of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, expansion of the auto industry, urban development, and two wars contributed to the state's industrial growth. During the second half of the 20thcentury, Indiana became a leader in the pharmaceutical industry due to <b>the</b> <b>innovations</b> of companies such as Eli Lilly.|$|E
