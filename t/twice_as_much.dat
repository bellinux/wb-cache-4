5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the United States entered World War II in 1941, oil was a vital part of {{military}} operations around the world. The United States produced 60 percent of the world's crude oil, with the state of Texas in the south-west leading this production, producing more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> crude as any other state. The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3,500 smaller operators.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E

5|$|In the 1900s, Bolckow, Vaughan was {{certainly}} the largest steel producer in Britain, and possibly {{the largest in the}} world. In 1905, the firm produced 820,000 tons of pig iron, which was 8.5% of Great Britain's output, and <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the next largest producer. In 1907 {{it was one of the}} largest firms in Britain, with 20,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker {{was noted}} for its high {{production}} cost of $34million, almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> money as predecessor The Spy Who Loved Me, and it received mixed reviews. However, the film's visuals were praised with Derek Meddings being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and it eventually became the highest-grossing film of the series with $210,300,000 worldwide, a record that stood until 1995's GoldenEye.|$|E
5|$|Skilling {{believed}} that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking. As a result, extravagant spending was rampant throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as competitors. In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} erythroid marrow {{production}} varies widely in different erythropoietic disorders. In part, this reflects {{the level of}} erythropoietin stimulation {{as determined by the}} severity of the anemia. However, iron supply plays an equally important role in the control of erythropoiesis. As demonstrated in normal individuals subjected to prolonged periods of phlebotomy-induced anemia, the erythroid marrow will increase production by <b>as</b> little <b>as</b> <b>twice</b> to <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> eight times normal, depending on the iron supply available from different iron pools. Whereas the iron delivered from normal reticuloendothelial stores or orally administered iron is sufficient for a marrow production response of only two to three times normal, the increased iron supply from nonviable red cells, hemolysis, or iron dextran infusions permits marrow production to rise acutely to levels of four to eight times normal...|$|R

One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
40|$|The Kyoto {{protocol}} was taken effect, {{we have to}} reduce CO 2 in residential sector that accounts for about 14 % of total energy consumption in Japan. So {{it is necessary to}} understand energy consumption of residential buildings. According to this background, the energy consumption of residential buildings was measured for long-term on national scale. This paper reports the use structure of annual energy consumption and the energy consumption for air-conditioning, in which {{there are a lot of}} differences of each region. The results are as follows; Annual energy consumption in Hokkaido, Tohoku and Hokuriku regions are about <b>twice</b> time <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> that in Kyushu. Especially, there is a difference in the energy consumption for air-conditioning. Some of reasons are meteorological conditions and heating time and temperature of room when it is heating...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E

McConnell also raised <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> money as Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming {{much of the money}} came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Like most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother–cub groups. Adults {{generally}} meet only {{to court}} and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40km2 in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females. The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to mark its territory.|$|E
40|$|Rotational and {{vertical}} components of ground motion {{are almost always}} ignored in design or assessment of structures {{despite the fact that}} vertical motion can be <b>as</b> <b>twice</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> horizontal and may exceed 2 g level, while rotational excitation may reach few degrees in the proximity of fault rupture. Coupling of different components of ground excitation may significantly amplify the seismic demand by introducing additional lateral forces and enhanced P-Δ effects. In this paper, a governing equation of motion is postulated to compute the response of a SDOF oscillator under multi-component excitation. Expanded equation includes secondary P-Δ components associated with combined impacts of tilt {{and vertical}} excitations in addition to inertial forcing terms due to angular and translational accelerations. The elastic and inelastic spectral ordinates traditionally generated considering uni-axial input motion are compared at the end with those of multi-component response spectra of coupled horizontal, vertical and tilting motions. The proposed multi-component response spectrum reflects kinematic characteristics of the ground motion that are not identifiable by the conventional spectrum itself at least for near-fault region where high intensity vertical shaking and rotational excitation are likely to occur...|$|R

By 1865 there were 20,000 blacks in the city, a sevenfold increase from the 3,000 before the war. The presence of black Union soldiers was resented by ethnic whites in the city; thousands of Irish had immigrated since the mid-19th century. In 1866 there was a major massacre with whites attacking blacks. Forty-five blacks were reported killed, and nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> many wounded; <b>much</b> of their makeshift housing was destroyed.

5|$|The BBC regime brought {{immediate}} benefits. The use of {{the second}} half of concerts to promote Chappell's songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC's control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell's. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can weigh more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There {{do not appear to be}} any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|This was but {{one point}} of {{difference}} between Oak Ridge residents {{and the rest of}} Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years. Oak Ridge residents demanded, and Groves insisted on, schools with fine teachers and first-rate facilities. To achieve this, the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as Anderson County. The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment.|$|E

5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
