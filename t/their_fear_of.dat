5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children. Non-rabid coyotes in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have been bitten.|$|E

He was released two days later. The following month, {{he was forced to}} formally cease to be a monk after several monasteries refused him membership, which he said was due to <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> government reprisals if they were to allow him to enter. He then returned to his birth name of Nyi Nyi Lwin.|$|E
5|$|Freddy vs. Jason (2003) is a {{crossover}} film {{in which}} Jason battles A Nightmare on Elm Street's villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a supernatural killer who murders {{people in their}} dreams. Krueger has grown weak, as people in his home town of Springwood have suppressed <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> him. Freddy, who is impersonating Jason's mother (Paula Shaw), resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) from Hell and sends him to Springwood to cause panic and fear. Jason accomplishes this, but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues in both the dream world and Crystal Lake. The identity of the winner is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> dying.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, {{the editor}} of El Imparcial, the main {{opposition}} newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters {{reaching out to the}} leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts to rig them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala City in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} proceeded northwards through Ch'ol {{territory and}} into Mopan territory; there they camped at Mopan town (modern San Luis). Due to <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> their warlike Itza neighbours, both the Ch'ol and the Mopans claimed {{not to know}} of any paths to Lake Petén Itzá. The Spanish were held up at Mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions among their native carriers. The Dominicans {{took advantage of the}} delay to proselytise the Mopans and Cano wrote that he had converted four caciques (native chiefs) there, although Taxim Chan, king of the Mopans, had fled with many of the local inhabitants. Cano believed that the Mopans were ruled by the king of the Itzas.|$|E

5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E
25|$|The Allies {{recognized}} the Transcaucasian Republics {{partly because of}} <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> Bolshevism, but their activities directed against Bolshevism, at least in Transcaucasia, did not go much beyond words, the strongest of which were status quo, recognition, demarche, {{and a list of}} standard diplomatic remonstrances.|$|E
25|$|Wolf {{attacks are}} more likely to happen when preceded by a long period of habituation, during which wolves {{gradually}} lose <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> humans.

Their archers are unmatched by all but the Elves, but their Hobbit militia are the slowest and weakest warriors in the game. Aside from the Fellowship of the Ring, they never ally with other armies because of <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the outside world.

25|$|Alligators are {{generally}} timid towards humans {{and tend to}} walk or swim away if one approaches. This has led some people {{to the practice of}} approaching alligators and their nests in a manner that may provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. If fed, the alligators will eventually lose <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> humans and will learn to associate humans with food, thereby becoming both a greater danger to people, and at greater risk from them.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{literary}} figures {{developed a}} conservative sensibility and warned of threats to Western Civilization. In the 1900–1950 era Henry Adams, T. S.

Instead they searched for a rationale for promoting traditional cultural values in the face of <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> an onslaught by moral nihilism based on historical and scientific relativism.|$|E

25|$|According to Adalberto Aguirre, {{there were}} 1,161 slaves {{executed}} in the U.S. between the 1790s and 1850s. Quick executions of innocent slaves {{as well as}} suspects typically followed any attempted slave rebellions, as white militias overreacted with widespread killings that expressed <b>their</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> rebellions, or suspected rebellions.|$|R
25|$|Traditional manmade {{threats to}} macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest woods for {{construction}} and fuel, and hunting. These threats have declined due {{to social and}} economic changes in Japan since World War II, but other threats have emerged. The replacement of natural forest with lumber plantations {{is the most serious}} threat. As human prosperity has grown, macaques have lost <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> humans and have increased their presence in both rural and urban areas, with one macaque recorded living in central Tokyo for several months.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{of support for}} Mosaddegh by the powerful Shia clergy has been regarded as having been motivated by <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the chaos of a communist takeover. Some argue that while many elements of Mosaddegh's coalition abandoned him it was the loss of support from Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani and other clergy that was fatal to his cause, reflective of {{the dominance of the}} Ulema in Iranian society and a portent of the Islamic Revolution to come. The loss of the political clerics effectively cut Mosaddegh's connections with the lower middle classes and the Iranian masses which are crucial to any popular movement in Iran.|$|E
25|$|Leaders of countries, {{including}} Australia, Canada, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Taiwan, Vatican City, United Kingdom, and the United States, {{supported the}} protesters' right to protest and their cause of universal suffrage and urged restraint on all sides, with {{the notable exception}} of Russia, whose state media claimed that the protests were another West-sponsored colour revolution similar to the Euromaidan. German president Joachim Gauck, celebrating the 24th anniversary of German reunification, praised the spirit of Hong Kong's suffragists to their own of 24 years ago who overcame <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> their oppressors; Chancellor Angela Merkel said freedom of speech should remain guaranteed by law in Hong Kong.|$|E

25|$|There are 24 Muduvan and Paliyan {{families}} living there.

They eat wild roots, maize, fruits from wild plants, honey and bamboo rice. Their limited income comes from selling bamboo products and lemon grass oil, which they spend to buy rice from other villages. These people are nature worshippers. They do not worship regularly or have a particular place of worship but have a sacred area in their village. They visit this area to celebrate the harvest festival Pongal and the rain (Mari) festival, during which they sacrifice a goat.|$|E

Moses sends spies to scout out the Land of Canaan, and the Israelites are commanded to go up and conquer the land, but they refuse, due to <b>their</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> warfare and violence. In response, Yahweh condemns the entire generation, including Moses, who is condemned for striking the rock at Meribah, to exile and death in the Sinai desert.|$|E

Maruyama holds his own against the behemoth and tells Paifu to start learning how to whistle immediately before they are killed. Although several attempts had been unsuccessful, Paifu finally prospered in whistling and Baroaba is literally downsized by the sound, proving the weakness true, and is pounded by Maruyama. Before Maruyama finishes him off, he discovers that Baroaba only attacks to protect the forest's rare wildlife; Baroaba apologizes for the misunderstanding and decides to help them get to their destination, the witch's house.|$|E
