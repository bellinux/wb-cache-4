40|$|The {{proposed}} high-level {{radioactive waste}} repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, would be constructed in the high-silica rhyolite (Tptp) member of the Miocene-age Topopah Spring Tuff, a mostly welded ash-flow tuff in the {approx} 500 -m-thick unsaturated zone. Strontium isotope compositions have been measured in pore water centrifuged from preserved core samples and in leachates of pore-water salts from dried core samples, both from boreholes in the Tptp. Strontium isotope ratios ({sup 87 }Sr/{sup 86 }Sr) vary systematically with depth in the surface-based boreholes. Ratios in pore water near the surface (0. 7114 to 0. 7124) reflect the range of ratios in soil carbonate (0. 7112 to 0. 7125) collected near the boreholes, but ratios in the Tptp (0. 7122 to 0. 7127) at depths of 150 to 370 m have a narrower range and are more radiogenic due to interaction with the volcanic rocks (primarily non-welded tuffs) above the Tptp. An advection-reaction model relates the rate of strontium dissolution from the rocks with flow velocity. The model results agree with the low transport velocity ({approx} 2 cm per year) calculated from carbon- 14 data by I. C. Yang (2002, App. Geochem., v. 17, no. 6, p. 807 - 817). Strontium isotope ratios in pore water from Tptp samples from horizontal boreholes collared in tunnels at the proposed repository horizon have a similar range (0. 7121 to 0. 7127), also indicating a low transport velocity. Strontium isotope compositions of pore water below the proposed repository in core samples from boreholes drilled vertically downward from tunnel floors are more varied, ranging from 0. 7112 to 0. 7127. The lower ratios (< 0. 7121) indicate {{that some of the}} pore water in these boreholes was replaced by tunnel construction water, which had an {sup 87 }Sr/{sup 86 }Sr of 0. 7115.

Aim of these studies has been the identification of the existing or potential geological, geomorphological and engineering geological problems {{as the basis for the}} future executive planning. At the beginning geology and geomorphology of the area have been studied on the base of the existing geological maps integrating them with direct field analysis where and when necessary. The outcropping rocks have been classified according to the existing international regulations, considering the results of both field analyses and some laboratory tests. Then, the problems along the railway layout have been identified. The main problems result to be mainly constituted by the geomorphological activity of the area (debris flow and rock falls) and by the stability of the <b>tunnel</b> crown and <b>invert.</b> Debris flows are widespread in the area, as it shows the ideal conditions, both climatic and lithological, for the trigger of these phenomena. This type of phenomena are particularly dangerous due to their velocity and relatively large volumes. A preliminary analysis of the triggering conditions has been carried out considering intense storm as the only one trigger. Common are also snow avalanches, mapped by the Basin Authority, but not considered in this phase of studies. However, it has been observed that they generally follow the debris flow creeks. As a first approximation, the risk for rock falling has been statistically analysed with the software Rockfall whereas the tunnel stability conditions has been 8 performed using a finite differences software (FLAC). A preliminary simulation of the tunnel stability in rocks has been performed also using a distinct elements software (UDEC) in order to better considering the effect of the discontinuities geometry and mechanical properties. Concluding, the geological and engineering geological setting of the examined area are such that a new railway may be planned. However, while the problems connected with the tunnel digging out and with rockfalls seem to be not too much complex, and then resolvable, the future trigger and development of debris flows must be carefully analysed and efficient countermeasures forecast...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{excavating}} a tunnel is not fulfilled {{unless it is}} stable. One of the major causes of instability in tunnels is induced stresses around it. Tunnels excavated in weak and schistose rock mass below high overburden (rock cover) are prone to instability {{in the form of}} tunnel deformation. The deformation in the tunnel takes place {{to such an extent that}} it is irreversible and of significant magnitude, which is often known as tunnel squeezing. In order to limit such plastic deformation in tunnels, it is desirable that the response of the rock mass to the induced stresses is known so that requirement of rock support can be estimated. Rock support interaction is an important tool in such endeavor; and the Convergence Confinement Method is the common approach used for this purpose. Contrary to the assumption of uniform in-situ stresses made in analytical solutions for elasto-plastic analyses, large degree of stress anisotropy condition prevails in most tunnelling conditions. The effect of such anisotropic stress condition leads to varying degrees of deformations around the tunnel contour. Therefore, stress anisotropy is also an important factor that needs to be addressed to ensure a proper support design for tunnels. This thesis assesses the inter-relationship among rock mass property, in-situ stresses including horizontal to vertical stress ratio, tunnel support pressure and deformation. The work is based on the tunnel cases from the Nepal Himalaya. For this purpose, four completed tunnel projects from that region were selected, where moderate to large tunnel deformations had been recorded. Long term deformation records were analyzed to assess time independent and time dependent deformations. Furthermore, the behavior of average quality rock mass was also evaluated using the records of multiple point borehole extensometer monitored at four tunnel sections. Evaluations were made addressing both the rock mas around the tunnel wall and at depth. In addition, the effect of groundwater on tunnel stability in faulted rock mass was also assessed in a severely squeezed tunnel. Results of the analyses of the tunnels in weak and schistose rock mass at stress anisotropy states show that a good correlation among tunnel strain, rock mass shear modulus, support pressure, vertical stress and stress ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses exists. Moreover, the study also shows that significant amount of time dependent deformation can occur in such weak rock mass. Such deformation was found to be high in schist and micaceous phyllite, moderate in graphitic phyllite and low in siliceous phyllite. Similarly, analyses incorporating instrumentation data in average quality rocks show that stress anisotropy cause tensional cracks in <b>tunnel</b> crown and <b>inverts</b> whereas <b>tunnel</b> walls will have compressional failures. Moreover, the study also shows that deformation patterns in tunnels are altered by in-homogeneity in the rock mass. The study on the effect of groundwater in tunnel stability in faulted rock mass shows that groundwater can increase the tunnel strain on average 15 % depending on distance from tunnel face and location in the tunnel. This study suggests relationships that can be used as a basis for an early estimate of instantaneous and final deformations and the corresponding requirement of support pressures in tunnel walls in weak and schistose rock mass. The suggested relationships, however, are for the tunnels in plane strain conditions where face effect is not incorporated. Moreover, the relationships are based on a limited number of tunnel cases. Therefore, further validation is needed using other tunnel cases subjected to plastic deformation. PhD i geologi og bergteknikkPhD in Geology and Mineral Resources Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Ground-borne {{vibration}} from underground tunnels is a {{major environmental}} concern in urban areas. Various studies, mostly based on numerical methods, have been conducted to investigate this problem. In the numerical models, soil stiffness and damping are commonly assumed to remain constant with depth (homogeneous assumption) {{in order to simplify}} the problem. However, various studies in the field of geotechnical engineering have shown that soil properties change with depth due to the effect of increased confining stress. This paper presents a study of the effects of variation of soil properties with depth (soil non-homogeneity) on ground-borne vibration from an underground tunnel. Both centrifuge and numerical modelling were used to perform the study. In the centrifuge model, a plastic pipe was buried within sand to model the underground tunnel. Vibration excitation was applied to the model <b>tunnel</b> <b>invert</b> by a small shaker. The tunnel and soil response was measured using accelerometers during the tests. Corresponding numerical models, based on FLAC 3 D, were built to simulate the centrifuge tests. The potential boundary effects of the centrifuge tests were examined by the numerical models. The model responses for both homogenous and non-homogenous cases were also calculated by the numerical models. Comparison of the experimental and numerical results shows that a homogenous model can give acceptable estimates of the tunnel behaviour. However, a clear improvement of estimates of soil behaviour is observed when the variation of soil properties with depth is considered in the numerical model...|$|E

Enumerations included total cell counts, and numbers of aerobic heterotrophic, sulfate-reducing, nitrate-reducing, and diesel-degrading bacteria. Additionally, the disappearance of total petroleum hydrocarbons was determined in microcosms containing subsurface materials that were amended with diesel fuel. Results revealed that microbes capable of utilizing diesel and diesel combustion products {{were present in the}} subsurface in both the walls and the invert of the tunnel. The abundance of specific bacterial types in the <b>tunnel</b> <b>invert,</b> a perturbed environment, was greater than that observed in the tunnel wall. Few trends of microbial distribution either into the tunnel wall or the invert were noted with the exception of aerobic heterotrophic abundance which increased with depth into the wall and decreased with depth into the invert. No correlation between microbiota and a specific introduced chemical species have yet been determined. The potential for microbial contamination of the tunnel wall during sampling was determined to be negligible by the use of fluorescently labeled latex spheres (1 {mu}m in dia.) as tracers.

40|$|Vibration {{generated}} by underground railways {{can be a}} major source of disturbance to occupants of nearby buildings. The numerical prediction of ground-borne vibration is a complicated problem that has received extensive research attention in the past decades. However, simplifying assumptions are always required in state-of-the-art numerical models in order to reduce computational effort and resources. A common simplifying assumption is to neglect the presence of a neighbouring tunnel, despite the fact that many underground railway lines around the world consist of two tunnels. This paper investigates the dynamic interaction of two parallel tunnels embedded in a homogeneous half-space. Two different methods are used to tackle the problem. The first is a fully coupled approach, where two cavities are generated in the halfspace to which the tunnels are coupled. The second adopts a superposition approach, where two sub-models each consisting of a single tunnel are superposed to calculate the vibration response of the twin tunnels. In both modelling approaches, the tunnel wall is modelled using the thick-shell theory, while the boundary element method is used to simulate the half-space of the ground. The vibration response of the twin-tunnel system on the ground surface due to a harmonic point load at one <b>tunnel</b> <b>invert</b> is studied and compared to that of a single tunnel. The efficacy of the superposition method in modelling the dynamic interaction of the twin tunnels is assessed against the fully coupled approach at different points on the surface. The results reveal the significance of the interaction between the twin tunnels and also demonstrate the accuracy of the superposition method. The feasibility of the superposition method in modelling the dynamic interaction between tunnels and piled-foundations is also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, when a bored tunnel {{has to be}} constructed, {{a launch}} and a {{reception}} shaft have to be excavated to guarantee sufficient cover. This is necessary to ensure face stability, prevent uplift and risk of blow out. Moreover, especially {{in the western part}} of the Netherlands, the first 10 to 20 meters of soil consists of the Holocene layer consisting of soft clays and peat. By starting the tunnelling process at sufficient depth, the tunnel will be driven through the Pleistocene and and the soil deformations will remain small. In 2009, a new method was introduced in Japan: the Ultra Rapid UnderPass (URUP) method. With this method the tunnel boring machine (TBM) starts tunnelling from ground surface level. Consequently there is no more need for a launch and reception shaft. This eliminates the need for expensive shafts which are time-consuming to build, which makes the URUP method interesting to apply in the Netherlands. However, applying this method will result in small covers at the beginning and the end of the tunnel lining. Therefore complications are to be expected. In this report, the feasibility of this method, applied for large diameter tunnels, is assessed by investigating the main complications associated with this method (tunnelling with marginal cover method) in the Netherlands. As a basis for the feasibility study a reference project, which is planned for the near future, is used. The reference project “Rijnlandroute” is situated in the west of the Netherlands (between Leiden and Voorschoten), where the first 11 meters consist of Holocene soft soil. For this thesis only the eastern start of the tunnel is considered, that is located in a polder. The groundwater level is located approximately one meter below surface level and the surrounding area is largely greenfield. Firstly, the soil deformations in the Holocene layer, when placing the TBM at surface level, are determined. It can be concluded that without ground improvement the settlements will become too big. It is therefore recommended to apply Mixed In Place columns, that have been applied successfully several times in the past for similar cases. When the TBM reaches the Pleistocene layer, ground improvement is no longer required and deformations remain small. Due to the high groundwater table an embankment is necessary in permanent situation to prevent uplift. Moreover, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>invert</b> has to be filled with a sand ballast as well. During construction (ballast is not constructed yet) the water level will be drawn down temporarily with a maximum of two meters. Due to the absence of cover at start of the tunnelling process, the force distribution in the lining differs from the conventional method. The axial loads are negligible, whereas bending moments still exist resulting in opening up of the joints, which might cause leakage. Therefore it is required to increase the capacity to withstand high bending moments when tunnelling with shallow covers. The required embankment will increase the normal force. However, this increase is too low to counteract the occurring bending moments in the lining. The Japanese box, which is a bolt type where the tension forces are transferred directly to the reinforcement, will be applied (permanently). This bolt type can withstand higher forces, though this bolt type will increase the construction costs. It can be concluded that despite these issues, tunnelling with marginal covers is feasible in the Netherlands. To gain more insight in the relative benefits of this method compared to the conventional method, both are assessed, considering the costs as well as the construction time. The comparison shows that the total construction costs only differ 1. 8 % (the costs of the conventional method will be 1. 8 % higher). However, the construction of the tunnel with the marginal cover method will result in a shorter construction time. The construction time of the conventional method is approximately four years whereas the construction time of the tunnel applying the tunnelling with marginal cover method only amounts approximately three years. Therefore, it will be efficient to apply this method in the Netherlands. However, despite the feasibility and efficiency of this method in the Netherlands, it cannot yet be concluded if tunnelling with marginal cover will be recommended in future. Further research is still required to conclude if the marginal cover method will be successfully. With this thesis it can only be concluded that the tunnelling with marginal cover method, applied for large diameter tunnels, is feasible in the Netherlands.
