This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of handwheel NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method, an improved <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} handwheel and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>setting</b> {{precision}} is a {{basic requirement}} in ultra-precision diamond machining since it directly affects achievable machining accuracy. Different <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> methods have evolved and brought to commercial availability. Probably the most accurate ones are based on LVDT, some apply machining of test parts and probably most wide spread are camera based systems. Systems touching the diamond tool cutting edge generally bear the risk of damaging especially fragile tools with high clearance angle. Camera based systems offer limited accuracy because {{of the characteristics of}} the optical systems applied and the need of removing the systems during machining. Applying sub-pixel interpolation methods and calibration after repositioning inside the machine system before every single measurement are two possibilities to cope with limited accuracy. [1] Thus, all of the systems in use imply specific drawbacks. Therefore, the feasibility of a non-contact <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> system from conventional machining for ultra-precision machining is tested. This includes integration into the machine control, repeatability tests and development of adapted measuring cycles. Modifications of the system to further improve fitting ultra-precision requirements are yet to come. A major focus applying the system was to realize automated <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> procedure to limit machine operator influence as much as possible...|$|E

40|$|The Freeform Thick Layered Object Manufacturing (FF-TLOM) {{process is}} very {{suitable}} {{for the production of}} very large objects. The technology is based on flexible blade cutting of thick foam layers, which are stacked to create a physical model. Positioning the tool under accurate cutting constraints is a complex and difficult task, since the <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> is controlled by 6 degrees of freedom. The <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> in combination with the blade matching with the required shape can be performed in many ways.

The orientation of the tool is fixed, next the flexible blade curve is matched with the local nominal shape curve and finally the tool position needs a correction. The manufacturing preparation is easy to perform for these cases. It is a method, which supports optimal flexible blade cutting, however, this method is not applicable in all cases...|$|E

The QC tools predominantly used for tracing out the causes for poor process performance are the Ishikawa diagram, physical mechanism analysis and the failure modes and effects analysis. The process monitoring charts are employed at the workplace for monitoring the process performance and preventing it from deviations. In order to trace out the extent of influence of the causes identified, the ANOVA procedure is adopted. The predominant causes identified are worn out cutting tool inserts, worn out insert setting v-block and non-calibration of the vernier calipers and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> mandrel. Finally, on eliminating the causes one-by-one, the process potential capability index (CP) showed an improvement from 1.29 to 2.02 and the process performance capability index (CPK) improved from 0.32 to 1.45.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical & Computer EngineeringSteve WarrenHandgrip contractions are a {{standard}} exercise modality to evaluate muscular system performance. Most conventional ergometer systems that collect handgrip contraction data are manually controlled, placing {{a burden on}} the researcher to guide subject activity while recording the resultant data. Further, post-processing tools {{for this type of}} experiment are not standardized within the domain, which requires investigators to process their data with multiple <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> and often create custom <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> for that purpose. This can make experimental data difficult to compare and correlate, even within the same research group. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control and data-acquisition processes as well as provide a <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to post process hand contraction data. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors.
