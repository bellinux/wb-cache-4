5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of the}} hull also meant that they were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
5|$|The French ironclad Normandie was {{the third}} and last of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a single gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of}} the hull also meant that they were broadside ironclads. Normandie was the first ironclad to cross the Atlantic in support of the French intervention in Mexico in 1862. Although the ship was active during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, she saw no action. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly; she was condemned in 1871 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E

5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E
5|$|In 324BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had {{entrusted}} huge treasures, absconded {{and sought}} refuge in Athens. The Assembly had initially {{refused to accept}} him, following Demosthenes's advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite the dissent of Hypereides, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided {{to take control of}} Harpalus's money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.* I. Apostolidis, notes 1219, 1226 & 1229 in J. G. Droysen, History of Alexander the Great, 717–726; K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 303–309; D. Whitehead, Hypereides, 359–360; I. Worthington, Harpalus Affair, passim. It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 311.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Channon reached the two platoons, they were {{crossing}} over two small hills {{just north of}} Kantongyon. As they crossed {{over one of the}} hills, Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds. Channon took the radio from Walker, who was now incapacitated, and joined the two platoons {{at the bottom of the}} hill. Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions, who responded, “move out when the tanks move out.” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them. Soon, the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley. As the Rangers started to move forward, toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700-800 yards ahead, they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire. About 100 yards out from the ridge, they received a heavy mortar barrage, resulting in a number of them being wounded. Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg. Shortly after, a couple of light tanks arrived. Pete Hamilton (1st Plt Ldr) and Channon crawled up on the tanks, bore-sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away. About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose, they received a heavy volley of grenades. Abandoning protocol (once you start a charge, you are not supposed to hit the ground), Channon, knowing that he’d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again, had them hit the ground. When they got up, the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight. When their position was secure, Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> eight Rangers capable of continuing on. Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue.|$|E

25|$|The trio {{recorded}} a demo in August 1993 {{and sent it}} to Wrong Again Records. In order to increase their chances of getting signed to the label, the group lied and said they had thirteen songs already recorded, when in fact <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> three. The owner of the label enjoyed the music, and immediately signed them to the label.|$|E
25|$|The MCC team {{suffered}} from {{a long list of}} injuries that affected their ability to contest the Ashes series, particularly as <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a 16-man squad because Johnny Wardle was not replaced when he was dropped. When they Australian tour ended only 12 men were fit enough to proceed to the following tour in New Zealand, Bailey, Evans, Laker, Loader, Milton and Statham returning to England instead.|$|E

25|$|Recording Unrest {{was another}} intense experience, and the strongest period of {{collective}} learning since The Bacchae. <b>They</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> enough material to fill {{one side of}} the LP, and so were forced to spend {{a good deal of time}} developing the studio composition process that produced side two. The recording session brought out a lot of tensions in the band, these being reflected in the music, but in the end they were pleased with the result and this reunited the group.|$|E
25|$|When the Drillers {{kicked off}} their inaugural season <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> three players with NPSL experience. Bill Sedgewick (who was also Captain) and Nick DeSantis {{came with the}} {{franchise}} from Chicago, and Todd Rattee who was acquired from the Milwaukee Wave for Mark Manganello. The only other player with any tangible indoor experience was backup ‘keeper Scott Hileman, who had played in the rival Continental Indoor Soccer League the summer prior. It should further be noted {{that none of these}} players had more than one year of pro experience under their belt.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, {{they would}} start the {{invasion}} early to maximise the dry-season campaign period. In the previous war, Alaungpaya started the invasion too late (in late December 1759/early January 1760).

This time, they elected to begin the invasion {{at the height of the}} rainy season. By starting the invasion early, the Burmese hoped, their armies would be within a striking distance from Ayutthaya at the beginning of the dry season.|$|E

25|$|Eickemeyer {{could see}} that {{although}} there were approximately 20,000 troops, <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> field artillery, not siege equipment, and a city the size of Mainz, even as poorly fortified as it was, would require specialty equipment.Custine sent word for a capitulation and the city fathers had a meeting on their situation. The French troops, now called Army of the Vosges by decision of the Convention, began the encirclement and siege of the city on October 18. On that night, the vanguard of General Jean Nicolas Houchard reached Weisenau.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{into the}} match-up against DeVry University of Atlanta, the Trojans sported a 12–3 record while the DeVry Hoyas had a 3–15 record. DeVry was {{classified}} as a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) DivisionII school who struggled to get wins against comparably talented opponents, let alone high-octane, successful NCAA DivisionII schools. The previous season, Troy State had set the NCAA record for points in a game with 187 – also against DeVry of Atlanta. Stacking the odds further against DeVry was that <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> seven players, thus any chance of resting and catching their breath during substitutions was minimal at best.|$|E
25|$|The Indianapolis Colts {{were now}} {{one step closer}} to perfection, as <b>they</b> <b>only</b> <b>had</b> only four games left to match the record set by the 1972 Miami Dolphins for most {{consecutive}} wins to begin a season. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning picked apart the Jacksonville secondary all game, finishing the game with 24 of 36 for 324 yards passing and two touchdowns, while being sacked a season-high 3 times. Jaguars QB David Garrard (who was starting in the place of Byron Leftwich) was 26 of 35 for 250 passing yards, and had one touchdown. Also of note: the Colts snapped the Jaguars' five-game winning streak.|$|E
