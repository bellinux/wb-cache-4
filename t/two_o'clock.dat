5|$|Confusion exists {{over the}} exact {{date of the}} Battle of Torrence's Tavern; {{official}} North Carolina historical sources often cite February 2 as the date, but Tarleton's memoirs indicate that the engagement occurred at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon of February 1, after the early-morning confrontation at Cowan's Ford.|$|E
5|$|The {{imposing}} {{scene was}} at the Long Bridge, where {{the main body of}} the troops crossed.

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence. When Sharp {{answered}} the door, the visitor grabbed him with his left hand and used his right to stab him in the heart with a poisoned dagger. Sharp died at approximately <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|In 1981 Icke {{became a}} sports {{presenter}} for the BBC's national programme, Newsnight, which {{had begun the}} previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on {{the first edition of}} the BBC's Breakfast Time, British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news for them until 1985, which meant getting up at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning five days a week. In the summer of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted Grandstand, at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme. He also published his first book that year, It's a Tough Game, Son!, about how to break into football.|$|E
5|$|The paralyzed Hamilton, {{who knew}} {{himself to be}} mortally wounded, was ferried to the Greenwich Village home of his friend William Bayard Jr., who had been waiting on the dock. After final visits from {{his family and friends}} and {{considerable}} suffering, Hamilton died at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> the following afternoon, July 12, 1804, at Bayard's home at what is now 80–82 Jane Street. Gouverneur Morris gave the eulogy at his funeral and secretly established a fund to support his widow and children. Hamilton was buried in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery in Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning he}} is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E

5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E
5|$|A {{little after}} <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt, the soldiers did not wait {{and opened fire}} on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a}} few soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E
5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
60|$|About <b>two</b> {{or three}} <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning}} the company began to decrease; the number of women {{especially}} dropped away home, some and some at a time; and the gentlemen retired downstairs, where they unmasked and went to play.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all quite possible," [...] {{the doctor}} agreed; [...] "but {{in that case}} Julian's not coming home {{is all the more}} extraordinary. If he met Faulkner between <b>two</b> and three <b>o'clock,</b> what can he have been doing since?" ...|$|R
60|$|Between <b>two</b> {{and three}} <b>o'clock</b> that morning three men {{climbed over the}} garden wall of Seaside Villa, and, having {{deposited}} their shoes in a convenient spot, went on tiptoe to the dining-room window. Here they paused to consult in low whispers.|$|R

25|$|At 11:30p.m. fire command, suspecting {{that the}} building's roof would not hold much longer, ordered all firefighters {{out of the}} building. At {{approximately}} midnight, the roof gave way and collapsed onto {{what was left of}} the building. The magnitude of the blaze was such that firefighters did not have the flames under control until around <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> that morning; parts of the building continued to burn until May 30, two days after the fire began.|$|E
25|$|In October 1907, he {{flew the}} machine from a cow pasture near Brooklyn Creek. After rolling downhill, Epps {{took off and}} flew around 100 yards (90 metres) at a maximum {{altitude}} of around 50 feet (15 metres). The flight ended in a crash, but made Epps Georgia's first aviator. In 1949, Lola Trammel told The Atlanta Journal Magazine that Epps had already made a successful flight in the machine prior to the public demonstration, testing the machine by moonlight {{with the help of}} friends at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day before}} Operation Weserübung, which started the German {{occupation}} of Norway on 8 April 1940, warning was received by the airport commander, Harald Normann. The aircraft were evacuated from the airport and camouflaged. At the time the airport was covered in snow, forcing the aircraft to use skis. A large shipment of the airport's technical equipment had just been shipped to Sola Air Station, which was unsuccessfully attempted recalled. At <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning of}} 9 April the aircraft were commanded to fly to Steinsfjorden at sunrise. The first departed at 05:15.|$|E
60|$|But in the Louvre the Queen-Mother and the Catholic leaders, the labours of {{preparation}} ended, were snatching a brief rest.

25|$|Over the years, {{the station}} {{expanded}} its news operation to include about 30 hours of local news production per week.

WTKR did air late newscasts at midnight when the coverage concluded.|$|R
60|$|They {{had only}} just emerged when the strokes of a great bell came pealing up from the town below; Allen and his mother {{looked at each other}} in amused dismay, then at their watches.

25|$|In Larache {{the coup}} started at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{in the morning}} of July 18. Several engagements {{followed}} in which five assault guards and two rebel officers were killed, but by dawn the town was {{in the hands of the}} rebels. By mid-morning the only remaining centres of resistance were the High Commissioner's residence and the air force base at Tetuán (Base de Hidroaviones del Atalayon). The rebels threatened to bomb both and after a few hours the defenders surrendered to the Nationalists; all of them were executed, among them the High Commissioner and the Major de la Puente Bahamonde (Francisco Franco's cousin). The same day, the workers of Tetúan and Melilla attempted a general strike, but were crushed by the insurgent troops.|$|E
25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, when the lights are usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
25|$|At <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> the {{vehicles}} with D. Manuel II and his advisors {{set out to}} Mafra, where the Practical School of Infantry would provide enough forces to protect the monarch. While approaching Benfica the king liberated the municipal guard squad that escorted him {{so that they could}} join the fight against the rebels. The escort arrived in Mafra at around four o'clock in the afternoon, but then discovered a problem: due to the holidays, the Practical School contained only 100 soldiers, as opposed to the 800 that were expected, and the person in charge, Colonel Pinto da Rocha, admitted to not having the means to protect the king. In the meantime, Counsellor João de Azevedo Coutinho arrived and advised the king to call to Mafra the queens D. Amélia and D. Maria Pia (respectively, the king's mother and grandmother), who were in the palaces of Pena and Vila in Sintra, and to prepare to continue on to Porto, where they would organise a resistance.|$|E
