The configuration for line protection was redundant {{and there was}} one set of busbar protection. Each busbar protection set consisted of one center unit and four bay units. Communication between the center and bay units was through an optical cable [3, 4, 5]. Automatic re-closure was employed with line protection, and the <b>timer</b> <b>setting</b> was 700  ms.

40|$|Current source-adaptive layered {{multicast}} schemes exploit merging capabilities at special nodes in {{the network}} to combine feedback from the multicast group. The merging procedures reduce network load and avoid feedback implosion at the source. In this paper, we demonstrate how {{to increase the efficiency}} of a merger node. We show how to tune two mechanisms: "feedback transmission", on the timer settings used by receivers, and "temporal merging", on the timer settings used by intermediate nodes. Our approach is generic, relating purely to timer settings, and does not touch on "content merging", or the decision regarding which packets to forward. We investigate the effects of temporal merging on packet suppression. We show that periodic feedback transmission coupled with a suitable <b>timer</b> <b>setting</b> at the merger node increases efficiency...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the reliability and}} performance of the Chorreras photovoltaic (PV) hybrid ice-making system. The system is unique and is located near the fishing village of Chorreras, Chihuahua in northern Mexico. Information gathered from field visits and a continuous monitoring data acquisition system are reviewed to discuss system design and operation. The system has been working producing ice {{on a daily basis}} with occasional control problems and water line calcification that sometimes reduces ice production. The hybrid system provides a daily average of 8. 9 kWh at 240 volts to the ice-maker. The system Coefficient of Performance (COP) is about 0. 65 and a total of 97 percent of the energy has been supplied by the PV array, while only 3 percent has been supplied by the back-up propane-fueled generator. Production of ice varies slightly each month due to changes in insolation and ambient temperatures. Overall ice production fluctuates from 25 to 75 kg of ice per day depending on water line conditions. The actual load control of the ice-maker is a simple feed-forward control. With a fixed <b>timer</b> <b>setting,</b> the ice-maker is operated daily for about 3 hours except for Sunday. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the need of ice is the same every day and that at least the weekly PV energy generation covers the consumption of the ice-maker. By consideration of additional states of the system a more efficient automatic load control could be designed. A Fuzzy Logic control is a widesprea...|$|E

50|$|Before the {{proximity}} fuze's invention, detonation was induced by direct contact, a <b>timer</b> <b>set</b> at launch, or an altimeter. All of these earlier methods have disadvantages. The {{probability of a}} direct hit on a small moving target is low; a shell that just misses the target will not explode. A time- or height-triggered fuze requires an accurate prediction; if the setting is wrong, then even accurately aimed shells may explode harmlessly before reaching the target. With a proximity fuze, the shell or missile need only pass close by the target at some time during its trajectory. The proximity fuze makes the problem simpler than the previous methods.|$|R
