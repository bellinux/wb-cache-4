Donziger in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.). Judge Lewis Kaplan issued an opinion on 4 March 2014, accepting Chevron's allegations. The court found that lead Donziger corrupted the Ecuadorian case by submitting fraudulent evidence, coercing the judge, paying off a supposedly impartial expert, paying a Colorado consulting firm to write the expert's report, falsely presenting the report as the expert's own work, bribing the judge <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> against Chevron and then trying to mislead the US courts.

50|$|Chevron in 2011 {{brought a}} civil RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) claim against Donziger, Ecuadorian lawyer Pablo Fajardo, Ecuadorian {{community}} leader Luis Yanza, and all 47 named plaintiffs {{in the case}} in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.). Chevron sued initially Donziger and his clients for an estimated $60 billion. Chevron dropped all money damages claims on the eve of trial to avoid a jury. During the subsequent bench trial, Judge Lewis Kaplan refused to permit the defendants to present any scientific evidence of environmental damage relied on by Ecuador’s courts to find Chevron liable. Judge Kaplan issued an opinion on March 4, 2014, accepting Chevron's allegations and finding that Donziger {{and other members of the}} legal team corrupted the Ecuadorian case by submitting fraudulent evidence, coercing the judge, paying a supposedly impartial expert, paying a Colorado consulting firm to write the expert's report, falsely presenting the report as the expert's own work, bribing the judge <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>ruling</b> against Chevron, ghostwriting the judgment, and then trying to mislead the US courts. Donziger and his colleagues have rejected the allegations made by Chevron, saying they were largely the product of Kaplan’s bias and a witness to whom Chevron admitted paying $2 million and who lied on the witness stand. Donziger and his colleagues also submitted evidence after the trial demonstrating the ghostwriting allegation has been contradicted by forensic evidence after an independent examination of the judge’s office computer found he saved the document that became the judgment more than 480 times prior to its issuance. Both Judge Kaplan and the federal appellate court that reviewed the case refused to consider the new evidence that Donziger claims disproves ghostwriting.|$|E

The latest development in this debate came last week when one of the Advocates General of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), Pedro Cruz Villalón, stated that in principle OMT would be legal under the correct conditions, which include removing the ECB from the ‘troika’ which oversees financial support to Eurozone countries.

40|$|International Child Abduction and International Private Law The aim of {{this thesis}} is to provide an overall insight into {{the issue of the}} International Child Abduction and to analyse the {{relevant}} instruments of law which desire to protect the child and other victims of abduction and to avoid harmful effects the abductions may have. In that context the thesis mentions the most important conventions which apply in this field. Among those legislations belongs first of all the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980 (hereafter as Hague Convention), also the Convention on the Rights of the Child (hereafter as CRC) and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereafter as ECHR). This thesis constitutes a complete and methodical overview of the return procedure under the Hague Convention.

40|$|Abstract: In the Federfarma case (2005), the Italian Consiglio di Stato {{refused to}} request the European Court of Justice <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> {{preliminary}} <b>ruling,</b> {{stating that the}} fulfilment of EC obligations would have implied the violation of a fundamental constitutional right. The Federfarma decision is noteworthy for many oddities, but its main reason of interest lies in the conception of fundamental rights which it expresses: to put it shortly, fundamental rights as “freedom of the State”. This conception is relatively new, {{but it is not}} unusual, and it is crucial for the judicial management of a multilevel system of governance. This Article argues that the discourse on fundamental rights underpins a marked flexibility and indeterminacy in the relations between autonomous jurisdictions; however, in the long term, case-sensitive application of fundamental rights may increase the loss of legal certainty and accountability. Depending on how they are understood and applied, fundamental rights can produce an effect of mutual delegitimisation between the orders in conflict, of uncertainty of law and political overexposure of judicial power. The dynamic of legal and institutional pluralism demands the creation of procedural channels that work as tools of dialogue. Rights alone are not enough in a multilevel system. legal culture; legitimacy; multilevel governance; sovereignty; competences; Italy; law...|$|R
5000|$|Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) {{establishing}} the preliminary reference procedure differentiates between {{the right and}} the duty of national courts to seek <b>a</b> preliminary <b>ruling.</b> Under the discretionary reference stipulated in Article 267(2) TFEU, a national [...] "court or tribunal" [...] may ask the CJEU <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> preliminary <b>ruling</b> if it considers that a decision on the question is [...] "necessary" [...] to enable it <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> judgment in a particular case. The obligatory reference (duty to refer) is established in two cases: with respect to national courts adjudicating at last instance (Article 267(3) TFEU [...] ) and with respect of all courts faced with a question of the validity of EU law. The obligation of national courts of last instance to refer for <b>a</b> preliminary <b>ruling</b> when <b>a</b> question of the interpretation of EU law arises is subject to certain exceptions. In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court, a national court is relieved from the duty to refer (i) when EU law questions are not relevant to the decision in the main proceedings, (ii) in a situation before a national court is “materially identical with a question which has already been subject of <b>a</b> preliminary <b>ruling</b> in <b>a</b> similar case” (‘acte éclairé’), or (iii) when the proper interpretation of EU law is “so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt” (‘acte clair’).|$|R
40|$|Article 234 of the EC Treaty covers <b>a</b> reference-based {{preliminary}} <b>ruling</b> procedure {{which is}} the principal procedural link between the European Court of Justice and Member States' courts within the Community legal system. Under this provision, the Court has jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>give</b> preliminary rulings on the validity or interpretation of certain Community rules which the referring national court seeks to apply in the main proceedings. However, there are disputes before domestic courts to which national legislations make Community measures more or less applicable, but otherwise falling {{outside the scope of}} Community law (purely internal situations). In these cases the effects of Community law are extended by force of national law beyond the reach envisaged by the Community legislation itself. The wording of Article 234 EC leaves open {{the question of whether or}} not the Court may give preliminary rulings in such disputes on the interpretation of the Community measures that are indirectly applicable only on the basis of non-Community rules. In most of such cases, first in Thomasdünger, the Court has assumed jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> preliminary <b>ruling.</b> 1 The reasons for the Court's position were first set out in some details in the Dzodzi ruling 2 that is why these cases are called the "Dzodzi line of cases". 3 However, it would not be easy to read consistency into the Dzodzi case-law. At least four standards or tests for assessing the nature and directness of the link between purely internal situations and Community law and for determining the threshold of admissibility can be discerned from the cases forming part of this jurisprudence...|$|R
