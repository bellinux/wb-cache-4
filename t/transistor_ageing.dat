The primary physical mechanism behind <b>transistor</b> <b>aging</b> is Bias Temperature Instability (BTI).

40|$|Advances in {{semiconductor}} technology using smaller sizes of transistors {{in order to}} fit more {{of them in the}} same area and increase performance, pose a threat for the reliability of integrated circuits. Technology scaling accelerates <b>transistor</b> <b>ageing</b> and degradation, causing more faults during the lifetime of an integrated circuit. Sources of faults such as manufacturing defects, degradation and ageing of transistors degrade the performance of integrated circuits leading to faults with a permanent effect that might be catastrophic for certain applications. A special case of integrated circuits, FPGAs, suffer from radiation-induced faults since they contain million of bits for the configuration of their resources that if flipped due to radiation might change the intended functionality of the application running on the FPGA, causing a failure. However, FPGAs can be dynamically reconfigured in the field and mitigate radiation effects providing fault-tolerance and high availability. A novel fault-tolerant architecture for an artificial pancreas application is proposed that consists of a mixed substrate of ASIC and FPGA. Fault detection is provided through modular redundancy, and dynamic reconfiguration is used as a repair mechanism. Experimental results show that 5, 100 x lower probability of failures per hour (PFH) than a DMR for permanent faults can be achieved with 2. 4 x more area than DMR. In addition, the proposed solution achieves 83 x lower PFH than a TMR with 1. 6 x area overheads when considering transient faults.

40|$|Abstract—As {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor technologies enter nanometer scales, microprocessors {{become more}} vulnerable to <b>transistor</b> <b>aging,</b> mainly due to bias temperature instability and hot carrier injection. These phenomena lead to increasing device delays during the operational lifetime, which result in growing delays of the instruction pipeline stages. However, the aging rates of different stages are different. Hence, a previously delay-balanced pipeline becomes increasingly imbalanced resulting in a non-optimized design in terms of lifetime [i. e., {{mean time to failure}} (MTTF) ], frequency, area, and power consumption. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware, MTTF-balanced pipeline design, in which the pipeline stage delays are balanced at the desired lifetime rather than at design time. This can lead to significant MTTF (lifetime) improvements as well as additional performance, area, and power benefits. Our experimental results show that for two different microprocessors, MTTF can be extended by at least 2. 3 times while achieving an additional 10 % energy improvement with no penalty on delay and area. If the demand for performance is higher than that for a longer MTTF, it is also possible to improve the clock frequency by 2 %.

The proposed method includes the impact of both process variations and <b>transistor</b> <b>aging</b> effects. A hierarchical bottom-up approach first models each system subblock separately and then combines these {{at a higher level}} to find the time-dependent distribution of the overall system performance. Analog circuit aging simulation is typically a very computation intensive task due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the need for transient simulations to evaluate the performance of the circuit over its lifetime. The use of fast function extraction symbolic regression (FFX) is proposed, to capture this high-dimensional non-linear problem with good accuracy. Also, an active learning sample selection algorithm is introduced to minimize the amount of expensive aging simulations. The algorithm trades of space exploration with function non-linearity detection and model uncertainty reduction to select optimal model training samples. The simulation method is demonstrated on a 6 bit Flash ADC, designed in a 32 nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show a speedup of 360 x over existing aging simulators to evaluate 100 Monte-Carlo samples. status: publishe...|$|R

Transistor scaling has driven {{the development of}} semiconductor industry {{over the last few}} decades. However, scaling has also generated numerous challenging problems over technology nodes such as power consumption and circuit variability. Power and circuit variability has continuously increased over technology generations, becoming significant concerns for circuit designers. Various circuit techniques have been developed to address these issues. Recently, ultra-low power or energy systems {{are becoming more and more}} popular. These systems include implantable biomedical electronics, wireless sensor nodes, RFID tag, and many portable electronics. For these applications where minimal energy consumption is the primary design constraint, sub-threshold logic circuits are becoming increasingly accepted since they consume roughly an order of magnitude less power, compared with normal strong-inversion operation. The first half of this thesis makes several contributions that facilitate reliable sub-threshold circuit design. First, we present a device-size optimization method for sub-threshold circuits utilizing reverse short-channel effect (RSCE) to achieve high drive current, low device capacitance, less sensitivity to random dopant fluctuations, better sub-threshold swing, and improved energy dissipation. Second, we apply the proposed sizing method to SRAMs and propose several circuit techniques for sub-threshold SRAMs that improve SRAM cell stability, writability, bitline sensing margin, and power reduction. By combining these proposed circuit techniques, we demonstrate two fully functional sub-threshold SRAMs in 130 nm process technology. Circuit variability is another big challenging issue in nano-scale technologies. <b>Transistor</b> <b>aging</b> is becoming one of the most pressing sources of circuit variations with each technology node. <b>Transistor</b> <b>aging</b> includes various mechanisms such and hot carrier injection (HCI), bias temperature instability (BTI), and time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB). One of the most dominant components among these challenges is NBTI, which is characterized by a positive shift in the absolute value of the PMOS threshold voltage. In the second half of this thesis, we propose a fully-digital on-chip reliability monitor for high resolution frequency degradation measurements of digital circuits. The proposed technique measures the beat frequency of two ring oscillators; one stressed, the other unstressed; to achieve 50 X higher delay sensing resolution than prior techniques. We also show ring oscillator based test structures that can separately measure the NBTI and PBTI degradation effects in digital circuits for high-k metal-gate devices. Finally, we present a test macro for fully-automated statistical measurements of SRAM Vmin degradation induced by NBTI. An automated test sequence collects Vmin data for statistical analysis and reduces measurement time. Various test strategies were proposed for Vmin measurements to identify different SRAM fail metrics such as SNM failure and access time failure...|$|R
