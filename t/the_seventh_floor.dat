5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> {{on the night}} of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Jingeling, the Keeper of the Keys to Santa's Workshop, {{was created}} in 1956 as a radio {{spokesman}} to promote the toys sold at Halle's Department Store in Cleveland, Ohio. Mr. Jingeling was immediately popular and became an annual fixture at Halle's where he prowled <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> toy department entertaining shoppers. The costumed character was first played by Max Ellis, a Cleveland Play House actor, and then by Earl W. Keyes, a television producer and director, who remained with the role for many years.

5|$|In {{order for}} a chain {{reaction}} to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 14 July 1989, the affair {{allegations}} and suspicions that Allan was a spy led Cornelius Lottering, member of breakaway AWB group Orde van die Dood, to place a bomb outside Jani Allan's Sandton apartment. The bomb exploded on a wall abutting Allan's apartment and shattered all the windows in the apartment complex up to <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> but there were no casualties in the blast. Allan's newspaper reported in a front-page spread that the attack was a culmination of a campaign of intimidation against her that had included prowlers outside her apartment and telephone death threats. Lottering was subsequently convicted of the assassination attempt.|$|E
25|$|The Gryffindor {{common room}} {{is in one}} of the castle's highest towers, and its {{entrance}} is on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a painting of The Fat Lady, who is garbed in a pink dress.

A centerpiece element {{in the room is}} a Nicholas Lochoff reproduction of The Resurrection by Piero della Francesca that was purchased for the lecture hall by Helen Clay Frick. Frick would later donate a large collection of Lochoff reproductions to the university which are on display in the Nicholas Lochoff Cloisture in the university's Frick Fine Arts Building.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, followed by its explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in December 1938, ignited {{a flurry of}} activity, with nearly one hundred articles on the subject published {{by the end of}} 1939. At Columbia, Fermi and Dunning were quick to verify Hahn's and Strassmann's results, and there was a lively debate over whether uranium-235 or its more abundant uranium-238 isotope was primarily responsible. Two groups began working at Columbia on attempting to create a nuclear chain reaction in natural uranium. Both were in the Pupin Physics Laboratories, but working independently, at least initially, and on different floors: Fermi and Anderson in the basement, and Szilard and Zin on <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
