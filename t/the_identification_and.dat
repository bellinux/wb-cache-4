In Study 1 (N= 76), anti-Muslim discrimination was associated with lower national <b>identification</b> <b>and</b> more negative attitudes toward non-Muslims, and these relationships were mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. In Study 2 (N = 70), we additionally found that anti-Muslim discrimination predicted stronger endorsement of Islamic group rights, and this relationship was also mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. The studies highlight the importance of group-based discrimination in shaping the perceived (in) compatibility of being British and Muslim, <b>and,</b> in turn, <b>the</b> <b>identifications</b> <b>and</b> attitudes of British Muslims...|$|R

5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>and</b> classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.|$|E
