5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen {{if they wish to}} try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have}} to act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

25|$|Whereas legal {{positivism}} {{would say}} that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence would say <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> legally deficient about an unjust norm. Legal interpretivism, famously defended in the English-speaking world by Ronald Dworkin, claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some things {{for which it is}} not enough to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. Just as if you were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we know <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

25|$|That {{evening at}} the ball, {{everyone}} makes their grand entrances and the couples dance. Henry has developed a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet. Leroy is able to convince Belle to stop worrying about Rumpelstiltskin and gets her to join the dance. However, the event is about to end early when Percival reveals that he had witnessed Regina slaughter his entire family as a child. He also reveals that knows {{that she is the}} Evil Queen and not the Savior, a fact he confirmed earlier by observing her through the enchanted necklace, and that he kept all of this from Arthur because he would have prevented him from killing Regina. Percival tries to kill Regina, but Robin steps in and fights him, only to be stabbed in the process before David kills Percival. Regina is desperate to save Robin, but her magic does not work due to an enchantment spell placed on Percival's sword. This prompts Regina to ask Emma to help save Robin by using her magic, but Hook does not want Emma to trigger her dark side. Meanwhile, King Arthur does not blame them for Percival's death, saying that his action was inexcusable, and admits that he suspected Regina's identity, but says that Camelot is a place of second chances. He later confesses to Guinevere that he thinks <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> suspicious about the new arrivals, but he has to trust them, as they are his only hope of freeing Merlin and finding the missing piece of Excalibur. Emma eventually decides to help Regina despite the risk, but the magic triggers her vision of Rumpelstiltskin, who warns her that a price has to be paid if she saves Robin's life. Emma ignores the manifestation and uses her magic to save Robin, but in the process it triggers the darkness in her, as forewarned by Hook, with Emma's hand beginning to resemble that of a Dark One's.|$|E

To {{find out what is}} wrong, they must go inside the machine.|$|E
500|$|Groves, testifying as {{a witness}} for the AEC and against Oppenheimer, reaffirmed his {{decision}} to hire Oppenheimer. Groves said that Oppenheimer's refusal to report Chevalier was [...] "the typical American school boy attitude <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> wicked about telling on a friend." [...] Under questioning from Robb, Groves said that under the security criteria in effect in 1954, he [...] "would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today." ...|$|E

500|$|Critic John Doyle wrote, [...] "From what I've seen, {{there is}} a lot of self-serving blather in Stursberg's book, and his loathing for shows that are [...] "dark" [...] (Da Vinci's Inquest, Intelligence) is comical. But he's correct <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> {{genuinely}} appalling about CBC's hand-wringing about where it goes." [...] One journalist reported that the president of Canada Media Research challenged Stursberg's interpretation of CBC's ratings, failing to take into account a new method of calculating ratings which made the numbers appear higher, though Stursberg countered that he only used rating numbers that came from the CBC's research department.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Katy {{is initially}} hired to babysit, though {{it turns out}} that there is no baby. Previous horror films, including When a Stranger Calls, have made use of a babysitter as a plot device, and an urban legend involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment into the unknown. In [...] "The Harrowing", he suggests, it is obvious <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> in the bedroom. The writers experimented with different endings, in an attempt to make the bedroom's contents interesting and genuinely scary.|$|E
500|$|The Elegy's {{continued}} {{influence in}} the 19th century provoked a response from the Romantic poets, who often attempted to define their own beliefs in reaction to Gray's. Percy Bysshe Shelley, for example, who as a schoolboy was given the exercise of translating part of the Elegy into Latin, eventually wrote his own meditation among the graves in 1815. His [...] "A Summer Evening Churchyard, Lechlade, Gloucestershire" [...] is metrically more inventive and written in a six-line stanza that terminates Gray’s cross-rhymed quatrain with a couplet. In theme and tendency Shelley's poem closely resembles {{the setting of the}} Elegy but concludes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> appealing in death that frees it of terror.|$|E

500|$|Consciousness is {{the state}} or quality of awareness, or, of being aware of an {{external}} object or something within oneself. It has been defined variously in terms of sentience, awareness, qualia, subjectivity, the ability to experience or to [...] feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood or soul, the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> [...] "that it is like" [...] to [...] "have" [...] or [...] "be" [...] it, [...] and the executive control system of the mind. In contemporary philosophy its definition is often hinted at via the logical possibility of its absence, the philosophical zombie, which {{is defined as a}} being whose behavior and function are identical to one's own yet there is [...] "no-one in there" [...] experiencing it.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Teacher", {{a central}} point in George's development, [...] "Kate Swift, George's school teacher, realizes his {{literary}} potential..." [...] {{and tries to}} communicate her thoughts to George but, [...] "...his sexual desire kindles her own, and she loses touch with the intellectual, spiritual, and creative potentials of her emotion. At last, however, George begins to perceive <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> more to be communicated {{between men and women}} than physical encounter..." [...] Yet this lesson is not solidified for the young reporter when, after boasting in a bar in the story [...] "An Awakening", he has a surge of [...] "masculine power" [...] and tries to seduce Belle Carpenter, only to be repelled and humiliated by her beau, the large-fisted bartender, Ed Handby.|$|E
500|$|The torments {{that the}} Joker puts Commissioner Gordon through {{are meant to}} serve as [...] "proof <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> buried deep within each lunatic, a nugget of insanity, that is simply {{waiting for the right}} moment to spring forth." [...] Unlike the Joker, however, Gordon emerges from his ordeal with his sanity and moral code intact. The story is also famous for {{changing}} how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots. The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology - that he is, in his own way, just as insane as the Joker, and that he and the Joker perceive the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke.|$|E

500|$|Other writers, such as Mark Anthony Neal, have {{described}} these lyrical themes {{as a form}} of “brooding introspection”, disclosing the tortured dimensions of drug crime and its impressions on an adolescent Nas. Critic Sam Chennault wrote, [...] "Nas captures post-crack N.Y.C. in all its ruinous glory ... ealizing that drugs were both empowering and destructive, his lyrics alternately embrace and reject the idea of ghetto glamour". According to Steve Juon of RapReviews.com, Nas [...] "illustrates the Queensbridge trife life of his , {{while at the same time}} providing hope <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> greater than money, guns and drugs." [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post described Nas's coming-of-age experience as [...] "balancing limitations and possibilities, distinguishing hurdles and springboards, and acknowledging his own growth from roughneck adolescent to a maturing adult who can respect and criticize the culture of violence that surrounds him.|$|E
500|$|Determined {{to improve}} his family's behavior, Homer {{attempts}} {{to get them to}} sit at the table properly, which goes awry as the family prefers to eat while watching TV. When Marge, Bart and Lisa claim there's nothing wrong with them, he decides to prove to them <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> wrong. He takes them {{on a tour of the}} neighborhood, peeking through living room windows to observe how happy families spend time together. The rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homer's sudden rash behavior along with unnecessarily spying on their neighbors and retreat quickly back to the safety of their own home. Depressed by the outing, he stops by Moe's Tavern for a drink. After getting into a fight with Barney, Homer later sees a commercial for Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center. Dr. Monroe guarantees [...] "family bliss or double your money back." [...] This gives Homer an idea {{to improve his}} family's behavior.|$|E
500|$|Carter {{called it}} a [...] "pleasure" [...] to cast Kate Luyben and April Telek, because they were [...] "good"-looking, which he felt was a {{refreshing}} change from frequently casting [...] "character actors" [...] on The X-Files. Luyben would later make an appearance on The X-Files and played a prominent role on Harsh Realm. The idea behind the character [...] "The Frenchman" [...] came from a prophecy by Nostradamus. According to Carter, [...] "the idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> approaching at the millennium, this series being produced I think four years {{before the end of}} the century, that we were headed toward something grave and foreboding". The name of recurring character Bob Bletcher came from an attorney Carter had worked with previously. Another name, Giebelhouse was another name Carter had gotten from his childhood years. Carter said [...] "This idea of the hard-boiled detective is a kind of cliché". But felt that the characters came [...] "very real to life", when compared to real law enforcement personnel.|$|E
