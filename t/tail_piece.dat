25|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves {{the air around}} it, {{producing}} sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes {{the character of the}} sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the <b>tail</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
2500|$|They {{are often}} seen as [...] "experimental" [...] instruments, being less {{established}} than electric guitar or bass. Hence, there are many variations on the standard design, such as frets, extra strings, machine heads, [...] "baritone" [...] strings that sound an octave lower than normal, and sympathetic strings. Luthier Yuri Landman built a 12 string electric violin for the Belgian band DAAU. The strings on this instrument are clustered in four groups of three strings tuned unison creating a chorus. Also the instrument features an extra pickup in the <b>tail</b> <b>piece</b> for extra amplification of string resonances.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole house}} was built upon the plan of a T, but a T with a very long cross piece and a very short <b>tail</b> <b>piece.</b> The long cross piece was the {{frontage}} that ran along in face of the street, with the front door in the middle; it was two stories high, and contained nearly all the important rooms. The short <b>tail</b> <b>piece,</b> which ran out at the back immediately opposite the front door, was one story high, and consisted only of two long rooms, the one leading into the other. The first of these two rooms was the study in which the celebrated Mr. Quinton wrote his wild Oriental poems and romances. The farther room was a glass conservatory full of tropical blossoms of quite unique and almost monstrous beauty, and on such afternoons as these glowing with gorgeous sunlight. Thus when the hall door was open, many a passer-by literally stopped to stare and gasp; for he looked down a perspective of rich apartments to something really like a transformation scene in a fairy play: purple clouds and golden suns and crimson stars that were at once scorchingly vivid and yet transparent and far away.|$|E
