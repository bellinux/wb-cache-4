5|$|Lad's mate Lady is {{run over}} {{and killed by}} a {{speeding}} driver who deliberately aimed his car at her. Lad and his owners both saw the crime, but were unable to catch up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> in time. Lad grieves terribly until {{they go to a}} local tennis tournament where he finds Lady's killer. He attacks the man to kill him, but the Master calls him off. The Mistress explains to the shocked crowd what the man had done, then takes a cured Lad home. They later learn that the crowd destroyed the man's expensive car and he was expelled from the club for killing Lady.|$|E
5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the Sprint Cup Series for one race in Penske's No. 12: the STP 400 at Kansas Speedway. Starting in 10th place, he led for seven laps and finished 19th (one lap behind). Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> change Hornish had {{to move to the}} rear of the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of repair time. Hornish drove the car in the remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places at Atlanta, Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E

5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E

40|$|Advanced driver {{assistance}} systems (ADAS) {{can be designed}} <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> current needs, for example, taking the traffic conditions {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the ego vehicle into account. This motivates the design of a system intended <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> local traffic conditions in a way, which corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> perception of traffic conditions. A new method of measurement is introduced. It is based on automotive sensor technology. A stochastic approach is employed to optimise and evaluate the relationship between the subjective measurements made by <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and <b>the</b> objective measurements presented. <b>To</b> this end, <b>the</b> drivers' subjective ratings are taken as reference. The analysis presented here is based on simulation data. The outcomes show that the design of the developed simulation environment is applicable to this work. It is shown that the objective measures correspond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> subjective ratings. Thus, it is possible <b>to</b> estimate <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> perception of traffic conditions using a technical measurement. The algorithm in its presented form is appropriate to give an estimation, which can be used as an input parameter for ADAS...|$|R
