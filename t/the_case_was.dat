50|$|In the United States, {{if there}} is a mistrial, or <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> {{overturned}} on appeal, generally this is without prejudice and (in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of decision overturned on appeal) either all of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> retried, or, if not all of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> overturned, <b>the</b> parts that were overturned (like a sentencing hearing) <b>are</b> retried. If <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, it will typically be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the defendant cannot be retried.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> {{interesting}} because World Programming {{did not have}} access to the SAS Institute's source code, and so the court considered the merits of a copyright claim based on observing functionality only.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{filed in}} the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>was</b> {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E

Beyoncé's father and manager, Mathew Knowles, stated that his daughter {{did not know about}} the copyright issues prior to the legal action, and that recording artists rarely involve themselves with such matters.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> usually {{cited for}} its holding {{that there is}} no de minimis {{deviation}} for population inequality between districts, and that all deviations must be justified by a legitimate governmental interest (such as geographic features or preserving communities-of-interest). However, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> earliest Court rejection of a political gerrymander—though Justice Brennan's approach does not require holding on those grounds.

5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion.

A Florida court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E
