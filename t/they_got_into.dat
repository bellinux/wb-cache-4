5|$|The role of Mahmud {{was filled}} when Balink {{was out with}} coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome– as he {{expected}} for the role– driving by. Balink called the Wongs and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which {{he and his family}} had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience.|$|E
5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed {{responses}} from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> card flourishing.|$|E

5|$|Since SMU had {{received}} the ball to start the game, Fresno State got possession to start the second half. The first play from scrimmage of the half was a 38-yard pass from Carr to Burse which got the Bulldogs up to the Mustangs' 41-yard line. The drive stalled from there, however, after a six-yard loss on a pass play, a false start penalty, a pass completed for no gain, and an incomplete pass. After a 42-yard punt that was returned for 4 yards, SMU was set up at their 14-yard line. The ensuing drive for SMU showed promise after <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> Bulldog territory, but an interception by Sean Alston returned for 50 yards to the SMU 15 ended any chance of scoring for the Mustangs. Fresno State finally put points on the board after setting up in the red zone; Carr threw a 6-yard pass to Adams making the score 22-7 after Quentin Breshears tacked on the point after. On the ensuing drive, SMU ran 7 plays for 75 yards in 3:20 in a drive that culminated with a 21-yard touchdown pass from Gilbert to Darius Johnson; the drive included a 27-yard rush by Zach Line {{as well as a}} 19-yard pass from Gilbert to Der'rikk Thompson. After the TD, the score was 29-7 SMU. The teams then exchanged punts {{for the remainder of the}} quarter.|$|E

25|$|The Greed Killing EP was {{the next}} release from the band, through Earache. After the preview with the EP, Diatribes, a {{full-length}} album was released. Although things {{seemed to be going}} smoothly from outside, they were going through problems. Misunderstanding arose between the members and singer Greenway was expelled from the band in late/mid 1996. Greenway went to record with Extreme Noise Terror (the ENT release Damage 381 features Barney on lead vocals) and ENT's main singer Phil Vane went to fill vocals slot in Napalm Death. Things did not go as well as they were supposed to, and Vane was kicked out of the band just before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the studio to record the new album. And so Greenway returned to Napalm Death.|$|E
500|$|A major {{television}} campaign ran nationally from 1983 until 1991 {{with the}} tagline (coined by playwright Peter Whelan): [...] "(Wherever you may wander) there's no taste like Stones". The series initially starred Bernard Hill and Tony Barton, although Hill {{was replaced by}} Michael Angelis from 1984 onwards. The advertisements followed the characters of Jeff and Dave as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> scrapes in various overseas locations, with humorous results. By 1987 it had become the UK's longest running bitter campaign of all time.|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. I counted them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. I have never seen a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E

500|$|The {{neighbor}} {{also reported}} the absence that day of Taylor's laundress, Sarah Carrier, whom the white women in Sumner called [...] "Aunt Sarah". Philomena Goins, Carrier's granddaughter, told {{a different story}} about Fannie Taylor many years later. She joined her grandmother Carrier at Taylor's home as usual that morning. They watched a white man leave {{by the back door}} later in the morning before noon. [...] She said Taylor did emerge from her home showing evidence of having been beaten, but it was well after morning. Carrier's grandson and Philomena's brother, Arnett Goins, sometimes went with them; he had seen the white man before. His name was John Bradley and he worked for the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Carrier told others in the black community what she had seen that day; the black community of Rosewood understood that Fannie Taylor had a white lover, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> a fight that day, and he beat her. When the man left Taylor's house, he went to Rosewood.|$|E
500|$|She married Michael Branch in 2000, {{and they}} have since had three {{children}} together. Early in their marriage they had a low income, and Branch's husband took on several odd jobs, {{in addition to his}} work as a youth pastor, {{in order to make a}} living. He describes living with Branch in a [...] "shabby place" [...] in Tulsa, Oklahoma where they struggled to pay $480 a month in rent. Later they bought a house in Tulsa, and rented it out while they were living in Colorado; <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> financial difficulties when the tenants stopped paying the rent, and they accepted the bank's decision to foreclose the mortgage, as that cleared their debt. They appeared on the Christian news magazine program, the 700 Club, talking about an incident in which their baby daughter was revived after drowning in their bathtub, and they attributed their child's survival to the power of prayer, having been inspired after seeing The Passion of the Christ a few days earlier.|$|E

Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk {{had been going on for}} a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. Ike sat down to have another drink, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp [...] "You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning." ...|$|E

500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the real world. Plus, you have all the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E
500|$|When Moorcock {{realized}} that the magazine would have to fold, he made arrangements with Sphere Books to continue New Worlds as a quarterly paperback anthology series. [...] Sphere produced eight issues, although the quarterly schedule was not adhered to after the fourth issue; the eighth issue appeared in 1975. [...] Six issues were reprinted in the US. [...] The early issues did well financially, with about 25,000 copies sold, not counting US sales. [...] Moorcock turned over the editorship to Charles Platt with the sixth volume, and to Hilary Bailey thereafter, to give himself more time to devote to his own writing: he also commented that by this time [...] "I no longer had my editorial touch (I couldn't read sf at all)". [...] Sphere cancelled the series after two more issues; it was briefly taken over by Corgi Books, but sales were weak and Corgi dropped the series with New Worlds 10 in 1976, although according to Moorcock he and Bailey decided to end the series when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> disagreements with Corgi. [...] In the US Berkley Books published volumes 1 through 4, and when they dropped the series Platt, who was a consulting editor at Avon Books, reprinted two further volumes, number 6 and 7 of the UK series.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{director}} Brett Goldstein contacted Vincent D'Onofrio's agent {{about playing}} {{the part of}} John Lange, but the agent said D'Onofrio would never work in television and refused to even suggest the part to the actor. Goldstein remained convinced the actor was right for the role, and mailed the script directly to D'Onofrio; the actor liked the script and agreed to play the part. The agent later contacted Goldstein a second time, and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> a dispute over how much money D'Onofrio would be paid. Yoshimura said that D'Onofrio {{was not the kind}} of actor he originally envisioned for the part, although he later praised his performance. D'Onofrio said he was attracted to the part based on the strength of the script and the reputation of Homicide: Life on the Street, although he had never seen the show himself. Fleder, D'Onofrio and Andre Braugher had only between two and three hours to read the script, discuss the characters and rehearse the material. Braugher said his first reaction to the episode premise was that it was a [...] "horrifying idea" [...] because he thought it would be sensational and end with a clichéd moral, which Braugher said [...] "frankly, nauseated me, the idea of that". But Braugher said that he was extremely satisfied with Yoshimura's final script.|$|E

500|$|While {{overseeing}} the operations at RAF Uxbridge, Air Vice Marshal Park {{stayed in a}} house opposite {{the entrance to the}} bunker. He used a small door to reach the bunker from the house each day. The house, named after the war in Park's honour, was demolished in 1996 to make way for newly constructed married quarters; only the garden wall and door were retained. Wing Commander Willoughby de Broke received the Air Force Cross on 11 July 1940 for his service as a Senior Operations Officer for No. 11 Group, working within the Operations Room. Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited the station on 16 August 1940, to monitor the battle from the Operations Room. He subsequently made his well-known comment, [...] "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few" [...] to General Ismay as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> their car to leave. Churchill repeated the quote in a speech to Parliament four days later. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the station on 6 September. Churchill was again present at RAF Uxbridge on the fiercest day of fighting of the entire battle: Battle of Britain Day, 15 September 1940. As the last squadrons were sent into battle, Churchill asked Air Vice Marshal Sir Keith Park, [...] "How many reserves have we?" [...] Park answered [...] "There are none".|$|E
500|$|... …And Justice for All was {{recorded}} from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Metallica produced the album with Flemming Rasmussen. Rasmussen was initially unavailable for the planned start on January 1, 1988, {{and the band}} brought in Mike Clink, who had caught their attention for producing Guns N' Roses' debut Appetite for Destruction (1987). Things did not work out as planned, and three weeks later Rasmussen became available after Ulrich gave him a call. Rasmussen listened to Clink's rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles, and upon his arrival Clink was fired. Hetfield explained that recording with Clink did not work out so well, and Rasmussen came over as a last-minute replacement. However, Clink is credited with engineering the drums {{on two of the}} album's tracks: [...] "The Shortest Straw" [...] and [...] "Harvester of Sorrow". While waiting for Rasmussen to arrive, the band recorded two cover songs—"Breadfan" [...] and [...] "The Prince"—to [...] "fine‑tune the sound while <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the studio vibe". Both were released as B-sides of the [...] "Harvester of Sorrow" [...] CD single, as separate B-sides for [...] "Eye of the Beholder" [...] and [...] "One" [...] respectively, and were included on the covers album Garage Inc.

He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you say such a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop.
