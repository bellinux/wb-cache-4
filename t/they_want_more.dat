6000|$|Saxton {{shook his}} head. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it's {{fortunate}} you're {{not going to}} be left to yourself, or somebody would take the clothes off you. Now, I've heard from a friend of mine, who has a contract to build the Canopus folks a flume. It seems <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> water, and it's Devine's mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{they are}} getting all they want," [...] the marquis said peevishly. [...] "They are passing every law, however absurd, that comes into their hands. No one is {{opposing}} them. They have got the reins in their own hands. What on earth can <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more?</b> There {{might have been an}} excuse for rebellion and riot two years since--there can be none now. What say you, abbe?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} of a pause after the door had closed. A certain constraint. I mixed myself a beaker, while Gussie, a glutton for punishment, stared at himself in the mirror. Finally I decided that {{it would be best to}} let him know that I was abreast of his affairs. It might be that it would ease his mind to confide in a sympathetic man of experience. I have generally found, with those under the influence, that what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> than anything is the listening ear.|$|E
60|$|He would go, he said, and {{ascertain}} what it {{was that}} <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more.</b> He thought that by a friendly colloquy with them he could appease them.|$|R
50|$|When NBC decided <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> {{science fiction}} {{oriented}} episodes {{for the second}} season of seaQuest DSV, G.E.L.F.s {{were introduced to the}} program, primarily via Peter DeLuise's main character Dagwood.|$|R
6000|$|But man {{is never}} satisfied, {{and so the}} miners, from {{gratitude}} to their owners, passed on to murmuring. Their sufficiency decreased with knowledge, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more.</b> Why should the master be so out-of-all-proportion rich? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{faithful}} creatures {{when they}} are well treated. Mighty few of them have run away all this time from their masters, though in the parts the Yankees hold {{there is nothing to}} prevent their bolting if they have a mind to it. I haven't got no niggers myself. I tried them, but <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> looking after than they are worth; and I can make a shift with my boys to help me, and hiring a hand in busy times to work the farm. Now, sir, {{what do you think of}} the lookout?" ...|$|E
60|$|I read at Manchester last Friday. As many {{thousand}} people were there {{as you like}} to name. The collection of pictures in the Exhibition is wonderful. And the power with which the modern English school asserts itself is a very gratifying and delightful thing to behold. The care for the common people, in the provision made for their comfort and refreshment, is also admirable and worthy of all commendation. But <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> amusement, and particularly (as it strikes me) something in motion, though it were only a twisting fountain. The thing is too still after their lives of machinery, and art flies over their heads in consequence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} no {{difficulty}} about that," [...] one of them replied, [...] "for there's been a notice up that Government wants to buy horses, and at two o'clock this afternoon, those who have animals to dispose of fit for cavalry service are to bring them into the parade {{ground in front of}} the infantry barracks. Government has only asked for fifty horses, and there will probably be two or three times that number brought in. We have each brought in a horse or two, but they are rather expensive animals. I believe the horses are intended for mounts for staff-officers. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> bone and strength than is general in the horses here." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Anchorage {{residents}} {{responding to a}} survey indicated that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> animals, including bears, in the city. It is unclear whether attitudes have remained the same, with some people growing uncomfortable with increasing bear encounters.|$|R
50|$|During {{the post-war}} era, fiction {{was no longer}} such an {{important}} draw for readers; <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> articles and picture spreads. To provide lively nonfiction Wiese hired two former Look magazine editors. Daniel Danforth Mich became editorial director, and Henry Ehrlich was named managing editor.|$|R
5|$|There was {{consideration}} that Aer Lingus {{would take over}} the Little Red routes under their own brand with the Little Red fleet repainted. However they declined to do this stating that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> flexibility with the returned aircraft to support their current fleet and operation.|$|R
6000|$|The {{swarm of}} renegades--dock-masters, berthing-masters, gatemen, and such like--appear to nurse an immense {{distrust}} of the captive ship's resignation. There never seem chains and ropes enough to satisfy their minds concerned with the safe binding of free ships to the strong, muddy, enslaved earth. [...] "You had better put another bight of a hawser astern, Mr. Mate," [...] is the usual phrase in their mouth. I brand them for renegades, because {{most of them have}} been sailors in their time. As if the infirmities of old age--the gray hair, the wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, and the knotted veins of the hands--were the symptoms of moral poison, they prowl about the quays with an underhand air of gloating over the broken spirit of noble captives. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> fenders, more breasting- ropes; <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> springs, more shackles, more fetters; they want to make ships with volatile souls as motionless as square blocks of stone. They stand on the mud of pavements, these degraded sea-dogs, with long lines of railway-trucks clanking their couplings behind their backs, and run malevolent glances over your ship from headgear to taffrail, only wishing to tyrannize over the poor creature under the hypocritical cloak of benevolence and care. Here and there cargo cranes looking like instruments of torture for ships swing cruel hooks at the end of long chains. Gangs of dock- labourers swarm with muddy feet over the gangways. It is a moving sight this, of so many men of the earth, earthy, who never cared anything for a ship, trampling unconcerned, brutal and hob-nailed upon her helpless body.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} to be solved {{is not one of}} Malthusianism, [...] "projected efficiency," [...] nor ethics. It is a question of might. Whichever class is to win, will win by virtue of superior strength; for the workers are beginning to say, as they said to Mr. Cunniff, [...] "Malthus be damned." [...] In their own minds they find no sanction for continuing the individual struggle for the survival of the fittest. As Mr. Gompers has said, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more,</b> and more, and more. The ethical import of Mr. Kidd's plan of the present generation putting up with less in order that race efficiency may be projected into a remote future, has no bearing upon their actions. They refuse to be the [...] "glad perishers" [...] so glowingly described by Nietzsche.|$|E
60|$|To me, I own, {{it seems}} in the proof {{a very pretty}} piece of workmanship. David himself I refuse to discuss; he IS. The Lord Advocate I think a strong sketch of a very {{difficult}} character, James More, sufficient; and the two girls very pleasing creatures. But O dear me, I came near losing my heart to Barbara! I am not quite so constant as David, and even he - well, he didn't know it, anyway! TOD LAPRAIK {{is a piece of}} living Scots: if I had never writ anything but that and THRAWN JANET, still I'd have been a writer. The defects of D.B. are inherent, I fear. But on the whole, I am far indeed from being displeased with the tailie. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Alan? Well, they can't get it.|$|E
6000|$|But he {{soon found}} out that the mental {{capacity}} of the Pitcairners was like a bottomless pit. However much <b>they</b> got, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more.</b> Anecdote after anecdote, story after story, fact after fact, was thrown into the gulf, and still the cry was, [...] "More! more!" ...|$|R
60|$|The next day, {{about nine}} o'clock, the second mate came to me, {{and told me}} <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> water, and, if I pleased to order the boat on shore, he would go if I thought fit, {{and see if he}} could get any fresh provisions, the purser being indisposed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{schools that}} formed the CFA banded {{together}} {{because of what they}} viewed as obstructionism of the NCAA by smaller schools. [...] "People were just fed up with the NCAA's parochialism, power grab, etc., but also <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> money, <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to maximize and <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> their fans {{to be able to see}} them on TV," [...] said James Ponsoldt, a law professor at the University of Georgia.|$|R
60|$|To me, I own, {{it seems}} in the proof {{a very pretty}} piece of workmanship. David himself I refuse to discuss; he is. The Lord Advocate I think a strong sketch of a very {{difficult}} character, James More, sufficient; and the two girls very pleasing creatures. But O dear me, I came near losing my heart to Barbara!

But on the whole, I am far indeed from being displeased with the tailie. One thing is sure, there has been no such drawing of Scots character since Scott; and even he never drew a full length like Davie, with his shrewdness and simplicity, and stockishness and charm. Yet, you'll see, the public won't want it; <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> Alan! Well, they can't get it. And readers of Tess can have no use for my David, and his innocent but real love affairs.|$|E
6000|$|But we must, I think, be more {{especially}} grateful to Mr. Ruskin for his calling widespread {{attention to the}} great Christian doctrine of the Fatherhood of God. There is especial need for this being uplifted before the thoughts of men at the present day, and it is being so uplifted. The more it is upheld, the more fully will it be discerned. It cannot {{be said that the}} doctrine is not accepted within the English Church. Still, it has not yet been received in all its fulness. Amongst the separatists outside the borders of our Church, the doctrine that God is the Father of all humanity, and the loving Father too, is rejected in two extreme ways. The set of [...] "believers" [...] who adopt the one extreme view consider that the Lord's Prayer--so luminous, as Mr. Ruskin reminds us, with the thought of God's fatherly love--should be used only by the elect, such as themselves, and that all others have no right to address God as their Father. The other set of so-called [...] "believers" [...] considers with a deplorable Pharisaism that they have arrived at such a stage of perfection as to be beyond the need for using words which require them to ask every day for forgiveness of their trespasses. Why should they ask for such, they say, when their trespasses are non-existent? If they are children of the Father they are not so in the same sense as those who conscientiously use the prayer addressed to the Father in heaven. I regret that Mr. Ruskin's facile pen has betrayed him into writing some words with reference to our Liturgy which bring him momentarily into sympathy with these self-righteous ones who have no need to confess that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> health of soul.|$|E
50|$|Better Than Sex is 2000 Australian {{film from}} {{director}} Jonathan Teplitzky starring David Wenham and Susie Porter. It is {{a romantic comedy}} of sorts, revolving around two {{people who have a}} one-night stand and start to question whether <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} 19 players (including all {{previous}} World Champions {{who were still}} active in the game) created the World Darts Council (WDC), later the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) {{towards the end of}} 1990. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> tournaments to be staged and to appoint a PR consultant to improve the image of the game.|$|R
50|$|In the 5th {{edition of}} the race, the organisers in {{association}} with SplitSecondPix offered each participant one free race day photo which was searchable by their BIB number. Each participant could chose and download 1 free photo of their choice and in case <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more,</b> <b>they</b> could do so by paying a nominal fee.|$|R
5000|$|The {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Peter Laird while negotiating the Turtles action figure deal with Playmates, because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> characters to release. They were added into the show and given names, personalities and an origin story by writer David Wise, based on instructions by Fred Wolf to [...] "put more mutants in the series".|$|R
5000|$|Barry W. Lynn, {{executive}} director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the protest [...] "shows the intolerance of many religious right activists.

50|$|Some HTIBs use {{proprietary}} connectors between components, {{sometimes even}} combining several different wires into one connector, to reduce cable clutter {{and increase the}} ease of installation. However, this can impede interoperability between different audio/visual devices and makes upgrading certain parts impossible. This may also be used by manufacturers to limit what a consumer can do with a low-end model {{and encourage them to}} upgrade should <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> autonomy.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, he was videotaped {{while working}} {{security}} for a site {{related to the}} BP oil spill. Mateen said of those working on the cleanup: [...] "Nobody gives a shit here. Everybody's just, get out to get paid. They're like hoping for more oil {{to come out and}} more people to complain so they'll have jobs. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> disaster to happen." [...] Video of his comments were included in a 2012 documentary, The Big Fix.|$|E

50|$|The {{interest}} fair {{originated in}} Columbus, Ohio at St. Joseph Montessori school. It was created {{as an alternative}} to the science fair because <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> flexibility. <b>They</b> <b>wanted</b> to focus on the student. When they did it they invited 6- to 14-year-old students to do an interest fair, but required the older students to do it. The students were judged and had to tell visitors about their Interest Fair board.|$|R
50|$|One unique {{aspect of}} receSs is its senior moments. During the last show {{of a school}} year, all of the senior members of receSs each have a turn {{performing}} their senior moments. They can {{do whatever they want}} for as long as <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> <b>More</b> importantly, {{the rest of the group}} does not know what they are going to perform. Past senior moments have included PowerPoint presentations, videos, getting a tattoo on stage and even performing live with the band Jukebox the Ghost.|$|E
50|$|The team realise {{that they}} are being cheated by their buyer Ekun (Gregory Ojefua) who pays a flat amount for every car stolen. <b>They</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> and he isn’t willing to pay more.

They strike a deal and begin {{stealing}} cars for YJ.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} on July 10, 2014. Jeff Li, {{vice president of}} Syfy, said that their [...] "one quest was to get a game out before or {{at the time of}} the second movie. We did not give the game developer a lot of time. Usually <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> than a year but here we said we've got to get a quality game out so it can ride the Sharknado 2 wave." [...] According to The Hollywood Reporter, if the game is a success, they will likely move on to another game for consoles.|$|E

50|$|Wayne {{wished the}} {{screenplay}} {{to have more}} development of the characters, but Warner Bros. made it clear <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> action and less talk, as The Alamo was heavily criticized for having too much dialogue.

50|$|These {{upgrades}} {{are part}} of a broader move to attract more console players. After the last game, Frogwares got feedback, from Xbox players in particular, that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> adventure games with 3D graphics and also production values to match what other genres are offering. And Frogwares was eager to deliver, though the developer still insists this does not mean forgetting about PC players, as some speculate.|$|R
