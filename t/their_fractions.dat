Horus-Eye fractions are a binary numbering system for fractional quantities of grain, liquids, or other measures, in which {{a fraction of a}} hekat is expressed as a sum of the binary fractions 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and 1/64. Early forms of this system can be found in documents from the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, approximately 2400 BC, and its fully developed hieroglyphic form dates to the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt, approximately 1200 BC.|$|E

5000|$|To use {{an example}} often quoted in modern {{reference}} works, suppose {{the base of}} a pyramid is 140 cubits and the angle of rise 5.25 seked. The Egyptians expressed <b>their</b> <b>fractions</b> as the sum of fractions, but the decimals are sufficient for the example. What is the rise in cubits? The run is 70 cubits, 490 palms. X, the rise, is 490 divided by 5.25 or 93 cubits. These figures sufficed for the Egyptians and Thales. We would go on to calculate the cotangent as 70 divided by 93 to get 3/4 or [...]75 and looking that up in a table of cotangents find that the angle of rise is a few minutes over 53 degrees.|$|E

This work sought to define the pharmacokinetics of solutes in tissues below a topical application site in terms of perfusate binding, tissue binding and perfusate flow rate. Methods. The disposition kinetics of diclofenac in a single pass perfused limb preparation after dermal application disposition was studied using dextran and bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing perfusates.;A pharmacokinetic model was then developed to relate the tissue retention half lives for diclofenac, diazepam, water, lignocaine and salicylate to <b>their</b> <b>fraction</b> unbound in the tissues, <b>their</b> <b>fraction</b> unbound in the perfusate and the perfusate flow rate. Results. Diclofenac had estimated tissue retention half lives of 18. 1 hr and 3. 5 hr for the dextran and BSA containing perfusates, respectively. The fraction of diclofenac and other solutes unbound in the tissues correlated with <b>their</b> corresponding <b>fraction</b> unbound in the perfusate. The tissue retention half lives for diclofenac and other solutes could be described in terms of the fraction of solute unbound in the tissues and perfusate, together with the flow rate. Conclusion. The tissue pharmacokinetics of solutes below a topical application are a function of their binding in the tissues, binding in perfusate and local blood flow...|$|R

40|$|We use {{the method}} of the color {{effective}} Hamiltonian to study the structure of color singlet chain states at N_c= 3 and at the large N_c limit. In order to obtain <b>their</b> total <b>fraction</b> when N_c is finite, we illustrate how to orthogonalize these non-orthogonal states.

With {{the help of a}} diagram technique, we derive <b>their</b> <b>fraction</b> up to O(1 /N_c^ 2) for the general multigluon process. For large N_c the singlet chain states correspond to well-defined color topologies. Therefore we may expect that the fraction of non-color-singlet-chain state is an estimate of the fraction of events where color reconnection is possible. In the case of soft gluon bremsstrahlung, we give an explicit form for the color effective Hamiltonian which leads to the dipole cascade formulation for parton showering...|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} rights {{approach to the}} theory of the firm based on the incomplete contracting paradigm was developed by Sanford Grossman, Oliver Hart, and John Moore. These authors argue that in the real world, contracts are incomplete and hence it is impossible to contractually specify what decisions will have to be taken in any conceivable state of the world. There will be renegotiations in the future, so parties have insufficient investment incentives (since they will only get a fraction of the investment's return in future negotiations); i.e., there is a hold-up problem. Hence, {{property rights}} matter, because they determine who has control over future decisions if no agreement will be reached. In other words, property rights determine the parties' future bargaining positions (while their bargaining powers, i.e. <b>their</b> <b>fractions</b> of the renegotiation surplus, are independent of the property rights allocation). The property rights approach {{to the theory of}} the firm can thus explain pros and cons of integration in the context of private firms. Yet, it has also been applied in various other frameworks such as public good provision and privatization. The property rights approach has been extended in many directions. For instance, some authors have studied different bargaining solutions, while other authors have studied the role of asymmetric information.|$|E
