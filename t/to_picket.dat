5|$|The {{situation}} {{reached a}} crisis on May 7, 1963. Breakfast {{in the jail}} took four hours to distribute to all the prisoners. Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> in unity in 100 American cities. Nineteen rabbis from New York flew to Birmingham, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed {{and asked them to}} go home. The editor of The Birmingham News wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests.|$|E
5|$|König {{participated in}} a fleet advance into the North Sea which ended without combat from 29 until 31 May. She was then briefly {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> duty in the German defensive belt. The ship again ran aground on 6 July, though damage was minimal. The ship supported a minelaying operation on 11–12 September off Texel. Another fleet advance followed on 23–24 October; after returning, König went into drydock for maintenance, rejoining the fleet by 4 November. The ship was then {{sent back to the}} Baltic for more training on 5–20 December. On the return voyage, she was slightly damaged after grounding in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal during a snow storm. König was in the Baltic on 17 January 1916 for further training, then on 24 January returned to the North Sea. Two fleet advances followed on 5–6 March and 21–22 April.|$|E
5|$|After Jutland, Deutschland and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, Deutschland had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.|$|E

25|$|The Taft-Hartley Act, {{passed in}} 1947, limited {{construction}} unions' rights <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> worksites at which non-union contractors were working by barring secondary boycotts.

25|$|The union's {{leadership}} {{had chosen}} to use different tactics in this strike; it ordered its members <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> without carrying any clubs or weapons of any sort. The police, on the other hand, armed themselves with riot guns which sprayed buckshot over a wide arc.|$|E
25|$|The company {{presents}} a Taft-Hartley Act injunction to the union, meaning any miners who picket will be arrested.

50|$|Often {{the most}} visible {{expression}} of anti-whaling activism is through public demonstration of protest: nonviolent action by groups of people, ranging from simple display of public signage and banners <b>to</b> <b>picketing,</b> walking in a march, or meeting (rally) to hear speakers. Actions such as blockades and sit-ins may also {{be referred to as}} demonstrations, although these would normally be considered direct action.|$|R

Jacob Kalish, an Orthodox Jewish man from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was charged with animal cruelty for the drowning deaths of 35 of these kapparot chickens. In response to such reports of the mistreatment of chickens, Jewish animal rights organizations have begun <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> public observances of kapparot, particularly in Israel.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intending}} to write {{only the first}} several episodes in order to return full-time <b>to</b> <b>Picket</b> Fences, Kelley eventually wrote most of the material for both shows, a total of roughly 40 scripts. Expressing a desire {{to focus more on}} his production company and upcoming projects, Kelley ceased day-to-day involvement with both series in 1995, allowing others to write and produce. Towards the end of the fifth season in 1999, facing cancellation, Kelley fired most of the cast members added since he had left the show, brought back Mandy Patinkin and began writing episodes again.|$|E
50|$|Picketing {{was largely}} {{unsuccessful}} at the plants of Ravenscraig, Llanwern and Port Talbot, which were all close to deep-water ports {{and had a}} range of methods of receiving coal supplies. The plant at Scunthorpe was inland and thus more vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>picketing.</b> The cokeworks at Orgreave became a target of the NUM pickets {{in an attempt to}} deny supplies of coal and coke to Scunthorpe.|$|R

50|$|Westboro Baptist began {{picketing}} Gage Park in Topeka in 1991, {{saying it}} was a den of anonymous homosexual activity.

25|$|Following {{the start}} of the Palestinian second intifada in September 2000, in October the RCG joined a group which had begun <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> Marks and Spencer in Manchester over their support for Israel, and helped to spread this to other cities. Over the next six years pickets of Marks and Spencer were held in places {{including}} Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Newcastle, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Durham, Rochdale, Nottingham, Leicester, across London, Stratford and Brighton. Throughout this period the flagship store on Oxford Street in London was picketed weekly, and in many other places pickets were sustained on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|By mid-morning, Custer {{had arrived}} at the {{intersection}} of Old Dutch road and Hanover Road. He was later joined by Brigadier General David McMurtrie Gregg, who had him deploy his men at the northeast corner. Custer then sent out scouts to investigate nearby wooded areas. Gregg, meanwhile, placed Colonel John Baillie McIntosh's brigade near the intersection and sent the rest of his command <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> duty along two miles to the southwest. After making additional deployments, that left 2,400 cavalry under McIntosh and 1,200 under Custer, together with Colonel Alexander Cummings McWhorter Pennington, Jr.'s and Captain Alanson Merwin Randol's artillery, a total of ten three-inch guns.|$|E
25|$|Most of Kilpatrick's men remounted {{and passed}} through town, heading northward through the nearby Pigeon Hills towards Abbottstown. He {{left behind a}} small rear guard force <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> the roads south and west of Hanover. In the meantime, Stuart had left his billet at Shriver's Corner, Maryland, and was {{proceeding}} northward across the Mason–Dixon line into Pennsylvania. Hearing that Federal cavalry had been spotted near his intended destination, Littlestown, Pennsylvania, he instead turned towards Hanover in adjacent York County. His progress was slowed considerably by a cumbersome train of over 125 heavily laden supply wagons that he had captured near Rockville, Maryland. In addition, he had skirmished with Delaware cavalry on June 29 at Westminster, Maryland, further delaying him.|$|E

25|$|A major {{controversy}} over the August 4 agreement erupted the day after it was signed. An African American sheet metal worker, Gilbert Foster, began work, which led to rumors that white workers would strike in protest. Despite an emergency meeting by federal and city officials with leaders of Sheet Metal Workers Local 65, 14 white sheet metal workers walked off the job on August 6. The workers argued that Foster was not a union-accredited sheet metal worker, and that union rules required him to work for at least seven days to prove his skills. Paul Ristau, business agent for Local 65, agreed that Foster had not yet become a union member, but said his application was being processed. The UFM threatened <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> if Foster was not employed, so A. Nabakowski Co., the sheet metal contractor, offered to keep Foster {{on the job and}} pay him if he reported to work. The following day, Nabakowski paid Foster to sit in a trailer. Local 65 ordered its men back to work, and 11 of them did so (under protest) on August 7. Foster himself agreed to perform whatever non-work, makework, or sheet metal work the company wanted, which short-circuited the UFM's demand that he work solely on sheet metal projects.|$|E
25|$|At 8 a.m. on May 28, Hampton rode {{off from}} Atlee's Station. As more of Grant's {{infantry}} crossed the pontoon {{bridge over the}} Pamunkey, Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg led his cavalry division probing west from Hanovertown, searching for Lee, while Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert's division began <b>to</b> <b>picket</b> along Crump's Creek {{in the direction of}} Hanover Court House. Three miles west of Hanovertown, and a mile beyond a large blacksmith shop called Haw's Shop, Gregg's troopers ran into Hampton at Enon Church, finding the Confederate cavalrymen dismounted in a wooded area, hurriedly erecting breastworks made of logs and rails, and well covered by artillery. Brig. Gen. Henry E. Davies, Jr., deployed pickets from the 10th New York Cavalry to Hampton's front, but they were driven back. The Confederates deployed in line in shallow rifle pits faced with log and fence-rail breastworks. Before Hampton could attack the approaching Union cavalry, Col. J. Irvin Gregg's brigade arrived and moved to the right of Davies's men, extending his flank. A Confederate mounted charge, followed by dismounted troopers, was repulsed. Hampton fed in the green troops of the 4th South Carolina on his right and they met Davies's next charge with their longer range Enfield rifles, killing or wounding 256 men. Union return fire was heavy as well, because the troopers were armed with seven-shot Spencer repeating carbines.|$|E

50|$|In 1983, Douglas Attaway {{sold the}} station to Viacom. Under the new management, the station began pre-empting CBS Sunday Morning with Charles Kuralt in favor of running infomercials in its timeslot. This sparked outrage from viewers, {{resulting}} in a letter-writing campaign to Viacom, CBS and local newspapers to push for Sunday Mornings return to channel 12. The station was even subjected <b>to</b> <b>picketing</b> by upset viewers {{in an effort to}} get the show reinstated. The station reinstated Sunday Morning onto its schedule a few weeks later.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{vehicles}} of {{change for the}} free speech fights of the IWW were spontaneous workplace strikes as well as on-site labor slowdowns in addition <b>to</b> <b>picketing,</b> parades, and demonstrations. Importantly, the IWW engaged in street corner public displays and speaking to raise the public awareness regarding free speech fights. The desire for direct action by laborers was attributed to having grown disaffected with the beliefs of the AFL. They stressed their truly American origins and likened their actions to those of earlier American revolutionaries and activists.|$|R
