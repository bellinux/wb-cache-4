Then he gave a final wrench, which brought the <b>tire</b> <b>off</b> so suddenly that Sam was sent flat on his back in the dirt and slush of the road. It was an occurrence to try anybody's patience, and Sam arose in anything but a happy frame of mind. His back was covered with mud, and {{a good deal of the}} slushy water had penetrated to his skin.|$|E
50|$|Reverted rubber (steam) {{aquaplaning}} {{occurs during}} heavy braking {{that results in}} a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film {{of water on the}} runway is required to facilitate this type of aquaplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the <b>tire</b> <b>off</b> the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to revert to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced reverted rubber aquaplaning, are distinctive 'steam-cleaned' marks on the runway surface and a patch of reverted rubber on the tire.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the rest}} of the field came into the pits, Bruno Junqueira ran into the back of Christian Fittipaldi, {{damaging}} the front suspension and breaking the front left <b>tire</b> <b>off.</b> Fittipaldi continued on, but Junqueira's car came to a stop at the entrance to the pitlane. This was the second race in a row where Junqueira was forced to retire as a result of a collision in the pitlane. The position of his car meant that Wilson, who was about to enter the pits himself, would be unable to pull into his pit box for service. Unaware of the situation, he pulled into pitlane and was forced to drive through without being serviced, losing valuable time and forcing him to come back on the next lap.|$|E

50|$|In 1987 Cotter {{sold the}} team to Vince Granatelli (son of former Indy car owner Andy Granatelli) to form Vince Granatelli Racing with Guerrero driving the #4 True Value/STP March 87C-Cosworth DFX. Guerrero scored his first Indy car win at the Checker 200 at Phoenix International Raceway. In the race Guerrero {{originally}} qualified 3rd, but the car was declared illegal and Guerrero started 22nd (last) to charge his way up through the field to win. At the Indianapolis 500 Guerrero and Granatelli {{were one of the}} few teams to have no issues with March 87C as several teams decided to use year-old 86C models instead. In the race Guerrero qualified 5th and was viewed as among the favorites, along with pole sitter Mario Andretti and defending winner Bobby Rahal. In the race Rahal retired after 57 laps due to ignition problems and Guerrero was in 2nd place to Andretti for much of the race. On the 130th lap a wheel came off of Tony Bettenhausen's car and it hit the nose of Guerrero's car and went flying into the grandstand and where it killed spectator Lyle Kurtenbach. On lap 177 Andretti started to have electrical troubles and Guerrero took the lead. On lap 182 Guerrero came in for his final pit stop and as he exited his pit stall the engine stalled. Third gear had been damaged earlier in the race by the Bettenhausen incident and the car began to get moving, only to stop just outside the pit lane. This caused Al Unser, Sr. to take the lead and get a lap on Guerrero. Guerrero finally got going and unlapped himself on lap 191 and there was a caution on lap 192 for Andretti stopping on the track. On lap 196 the restart came out with six cars between Unser and Guerrero. Guerrero was unable to get by Unser and ended up finishing 2nd to one of the year-old March 86Cs to be pressed into race service. Subsequently, Guerrero scored four pole positions at the Miller American 200 in Honor of Rex Mays at the Milwaukee Mile, the Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 presented by Texaco at Portland International Raceway, Budweiser Grand Prix of Cleveland at Burke Lakefront Airport, and the Escort Radar Warnings 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. In the latter Guerrero scored his second (and unbeknownst at the time, last) Indy car victory. Just days after his Mid-Ohio victory Guerrero was testing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway when he crashed and was hit by a <b>tire</b> <b>off</b> of his car. Guerrero was in a coma for seventeen days and did not compete in any more races in 1987. Guerrero finished a career-best 4th in points with 106 points, despite missing the final three races of the season.|$|E

5000|$|... 2003 Aaron's 499: On lap 4, {{entering}} turn one, Ryan Newman blew a <b>tire,</b> bounced <b>off</b> Mark Martin, {{and smashed}} hard into the turn one wall, almost turning over.

Mayhem ensued as cars checked up behind attempting to avoid Newman, who spun across {{the middle of the}} track, resulting the largest recorded wreck in modern Cup Series competition. The crash collected a total of 27 cars: Newman, Rudd, Jack Sprague, Jerry Nadeau, Hermie Sadler, Mike Wallace, Steve Park, Rusty Wallace, Mike Skinner, Mark Martin, Jimmy Spencer, Johnny Benson Jr., Greg Biffle, Matt Kenseth, Bobby Labonte, Tony Stewart, Jeff Green, Casey Mears, Jamie McMurray, John Andretti, Kyle Petty, Ken Schrader, Todd Bodine, Dave Blaney, Dale Jarrett, Jeff Burton, and eventual race winner Dale Earnhardt Jr., who received minor front-end damage.|$|R

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 20 laps to go. Johnson was {{no match}} for Kenseth on old tires who passed him with ease for the lead. However, Joey Logano was hot on his tail in the closing laps. Kenseth blocked Logano's advance going into turn 3 with six laps to go. Coming to five to go, Kenseth ran into lap traffic and it allowed Logano to close in and Kenseth went up the track to block him again. Rounding turn 1, Logano turned him and send him spinning. This brought out the seventh caution of the race with five to go. After the race, Logano said that the incident was [...] "good hard racing. He raced me hard, so I raced him hard back. The fact that we’re the only team that can relax now is going to pay big dividends going into Martinsville. To make {{a lot of these guys}} nervous going into Talladega is part of the strategy." [...] Kenseth spoke on the incident saying that it's difficult [...] "to drive a car with the rear <b>tires</b> <b>off</b> the ground. I was moving around the best I could, Joey (Logano) was a lot tighter, a lot faster on the short run, but we were so much better on the long run. I could still kind of get up to the top and get a run and get around him. We caught those two lapped cars, ‘Crazy’ (spotter) told me I was clear and I was, I pulled up in front of him and he just lifted my <b>tires</b> <b>off</b> the ground and he wrecked us." ...|$|R

50|$|As Director of Consumer Affairs in New Jersey, {{he worked}} with the New Jersey Legislature and various state {{regulatory}} agencies to enact over 40 major consumer protection laws and regulations.

Levin advised consumers on symptoms that indicated failing tires and {{the proper way to}} check tires for defects. He developed new consumer educational materials and distribution channels and made over 1,200 consumer educational presentations in five years. Other accomplishments as Director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs include the promotion of statewide financial literacy programs, two major tire recalls, and a national effort to secure the right for professionals to advertise- an occurrence which created favorable conditions for price competition and established greater consumer protections in the health spa industry.|$|R
50|$|An {{underground}} {{concrete vault}} {{had been prepared}} in the courthouse lawn with {{the top of the}} vault being three feet below the surface. The Miss Belvedere was placed on a steel skid with her <b>tires</b> <b>off</b> the ground. The car was coated in a cosmoline like substance and was then wrapped in layers of sealed plastic that was hoped to protect the car from moisture. The steel skid containing Miss Belvedere was lowered into the vault and the vault was covered with concrete beams that were then sealed with gunnite. The gunnite was a last-minute consideration, and unfortunately it was applied to the interior of the vault, as the concrete had been poured in place, and the exterior was not accessible. Following the replacement of dirt and sod a bronze marker, donated by a local cemetery, was placed to mark the spot.|$|R

Iuliano and the Bootlegger were well known for their racing abilities at race tracks in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina. Iuliano showed-off 1960s drag racing like it really was with his back tires smoking and the front <b>tires</b> <b>off</b> the ground.

Kurt Busch composed himself after the race, but called out Logano for his actions. An aghast Busch said in a post-race interview, [...] "Joey just drove straight through us.

But he just lifted our rear <b>tires</b> <b>off</b> the ground...You can't go from 5th to first, there's just no way."
