Wood said of her casting at the time, [...] "I didn't think of her particularly for the continuity announcer, but she came in and could do it, just like that. I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop. Anyway there were only two series of Fawlty Towers and, as far as I'm concerned, this rates with it, so I'm sure it'll be shown lots of times".|$|E

Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.'

500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> see them puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E

500|$|In July 1941, deHavilland was {{reunited with}} Flynn for their eighth movie together, Raoul Walsh's epic They Died with Their Boots On. The film is {{loosely based on}} the {{courtship}} and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth [...] "Libbie" [...] Bacon. Flynn and deHavilland had a falling out the previous yearmainly over the roles she was being givenand she {{did not intend to}} work with him again. Even Flynn acknowledged, [...] "She was sick to death of playing 'the girl' and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress." [...] After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film, deHavilland accepted. Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes, and improve the overall dialogue. The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together. Their last appearance on screen is Custer's farewell to his wife. [...] "Errol was quite sensitive," [...] deHavilland would later remember, [...] "I think he knew it would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> worked together." [...] Flynn's final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her: [...] "Walking through life with you, ma'am, has been a very gracious thing." [...] They Died with Their Boots On was released on November 21, 1941, and while some reviewers criticized the film's historical inaccuracies, most applauded the action sequences, cinematography, and acting. Thomas M. Pryor of The New York Times found deHavilland [...] "altogether captivating". The film went on to earn $2,550,000 (...) , Warner Bros' second-biggest money-maker of that year.|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E

Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, [...] "He was on his deathbed. We knew it was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> were seeing each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you,' but he never touched me.

Gray Davis, Vin Scully, John Wooden, and Jack Nicholson. [...] In addition to 400 present at St. Martin, the funeral was simulcast to 19,000 fans at Staples Center and broadcast on Los Angeles television stations.

2500|$|Green's {{performances}} {{earned him}} a re-match with Beyer – who was still the reigning super-middleweight world champion. The second meeting with Beyer occurred at Zwickau in Germany on 12 March 2005. Green {{knew he was in}} trouble by the tenth round when Fenech told him [...] "You won't win this fight if you don't knock him out", and came back strongly – knocking Beyer to the canvas for a mandatory eight count in the final round. Despite the late effort, Beyer was awarded a majority points win on two of the three cards, with one judge scoring the bout as a draw. Green praised his opponent after the fight by saying [...] "Markus Beyer was the better man tonight" [...] and [...] "He came back so well since <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> fought ... that is a sign of a champion."

A spoken word CD released in 1999 titled 13 Classic Kiss Stories, features Bill Aucoin (Kiss' first manager) where he also discusses Criss being [...] "let go". Criss, however, has maintained that he quit the band. The video for [...] "Shandi" [...] was shot in one day, and Peter was out of the band at that time; Stanley said of the shoot, [...] "We shot a video for the song 'Shandi' after the decision to let Peter go had been confirmed.

I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> saw him.

Indeed, one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>times</b> <b>we</b> talked, he outlined the challenges and contradictions facing physicists today. A few weeks ago, I engaged an eminent astrophysicist at Harvard, as best I could, in a similar conversation. I will not attempt to repeat either conversation, but Monty was spot on! Monty’s many talents meant that he contributed constructively to multiple projects. Soon after joining the staff, following one of our frequent and inconclusive debates about models of exchange rates and exchange rate policies, Monty tried to interest me in the application of chaos theory to the behavior of exchange rates. He even lent me an issue of Scientific American to inspire me. I was flattered. I had read something about chaos theory, but I did not think that Fred Bergsten would permit me the time to tool up sufficiently on the subject to justify a collaboration with Monty—my regret. More concretely, Monty gave me a piece of crucial advice during my first year at the Institute.
