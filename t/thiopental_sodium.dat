40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare a total {{intravenous}} (IV) anesthetic technique {{based on}} propofol and alfentanil with a commonly used anesthetic technique for craniotomy. DESIGN: Open-label, randomized, clinical study. SETTING: Neurosurgical clinic {{at a university}} hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients, aged 18 to 55 years, scheduled for brain tumor surgery. INTERVENTIONS: In 20 patients, anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and <b>thiopental</b> <b>sodium</b> and maintained with fentanyl, dehydrobenzperidol, isoflurane, nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and a <b>thiopental</b> <b>sodium</b> infusion. Twenty patients were anesthetized with a propofol loading infusion followed by a maintenance infusion at a fixed rate. In addition, alfentanil was administered as a loading bolus, followed by a variable-rate infusion, with additional doses as necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A decrease in blood pressure (BP) after induction with <b>thiopental</b> <b>sodium</b> {{was followed by a}} significant increase in BP and heart rate (HR) during intubation. BP and HR did not change during the propofol loading infusion. However, the administration of alfentanil was followed by a similar decrease in BP with a return to baseline values during the intubation period. Return of normal orientation (7 +/- 5 minutes vs 27 +/- 23 minutes) and concentration (12 +/- 12 minutes vs 35 +/- 37 minutes) was shorter and more predictable for the propofol-alfentanil-treated patients than for the <b>thiopental</b> <b>sodium</b> patients. Maintenance propofol concentration (nine patients) was between 3 +/- 0. 69 micrograms/ml and 3. 36 +/- 1. 17 micrograms/ml, while the concentration at awakening was 1. 09 microgram/ml. Alfentanil concentration at extubation (nine patients) was 79 +/- 34 ng/ml.

Materials and Methods: Newborn male Wistar rats were received <b>sodium</b> <b>thiopental</b> (35 mg/kg) daily for 11 days (from 4 to 14 days after birth).
