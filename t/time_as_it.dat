5|$|The season's first {{storm had}} limited {{reported}} impacts on land, {{and the subsequent}} system caused more severe damage in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Hurricane Three dropped torrential rainfall on Puerto Rico before striking the same region as the previous cyclone. Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba {{for an extended period}} of <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> slowly executed a counterclockwise loop.

5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane {{for a third}} <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{moved over}} the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western Gulf of Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the last}} round of matches, Al-Talaba had 17 points and Al-Shorta had 15. Al-Talaba winning in {{the last round}} and Al-Shorta losing or drawing would secure the title for Al-Talaba but, in the last match, they lost 1–2 against Al-Tayaran and Al-Shorta won 3–0 against Al-Zawra'a to create a tie on points and goal difference, Al-Shorta had scored more goals than Al-Talaba and {{therefore}} {{were expected to be}} crowned champions, but the Iraq FA ruled that the greater number of wins should take precedence and declared Al-Talaba as champions. This was a controversial decision at the <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was the first time such a phenomenon had happened in Iraqi football.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{had just been}} granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in a more limited form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E

5|$|Concentrating at Wondecla, on the Atherton Tablelands {{in north}} Queensland, after an {{extended}} period of home leave during which time the Victorian and South Australian personnel took part in a march through Melbourne, the 2/5th Battalion spent the next year training on the Tablelands {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Division. There was also a large turn over in the battalion's personnel at this <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been severely depleted due to illness during its previous campaign, and it was brought up to strength by April 1944 with several drafts of reinforcements, with the majority coming from New South Wales. To counter boredom and malaise amongst the men during late 1944, the battalion was occupied with a series of various sporting events and further leave. In the new year, a series of amphibious exercises were undertaken during this time with a view to preparing the battalion for future operations.|$|E
5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) was {{initially}} {{not part of}} the development team's plans. The Missing Link began development later in development, when the main game's visual theme had been finalized. Only the core developers were involved in creating The Missing Link, though development on the DLC did not take a high priority for some <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would take resources away from the development of Human Revolution. Director Jean-François Dugas, producer David Anfossi, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête all returned to their previous roles. The main designer was Antoine Thisdale. Main writer Mary DeMarle returned to write the scenario, alongside supplementary writer and author James Swallow. Additional music was composed for The Missing Link by the game's composer Michael McCann. He wanted to include music from the DLC in the game's , but recording for the release was already complete, and scheduling conflicts prevented him from including any music in the soundtrack. Despite this, he still wished to release the DLC soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Enrique {{steadily}} intensified and {{by early}} on July 16, the National Hurricane Center was anticipating {{for the system}} to reach hurricane intensity. Continuing to strengthen, it reached hurricane status On July 17. However, this was {{for a short period}} of <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> developed an eye. Due to uncertainty in the storm's intensity that day, it is possible that it could have been a hurricane earlier than originally estimated. Wind shear associated with a trough and passage over cooler waters caused Enrique to begin weakening and the cyclone center soon became exposed. Enrique was downgraded to a depression on July 19 and the weakening cyclone crossed into the central Pacific on July 20. Enrique dissipated shortly thereafter. Enrique's remnants managed to maintain a very weak center as it passed well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and then passed near Midway Island. As the storm approached the International Dateline, the system started to redevelop. Shortly after crossing the dateline, Enrique became a tropical storm again on August 1. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it lost its convection and thus the cyclone began to dissipate. No damages or casualties were caused by Enrique.|$|E

5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|On September6, ships {{reported}} a tropical depression developing {{just off the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal. The next day, a ship reported winds of 60mph (95km/h), or tropical storm status; on this basis, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on September6. However, lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> moved generally westward across the Atlantic Ocean. On September10, the S.S. Commack first observed the storm about 900miles (1450km) to the east of Guadeloupe, which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ship's radio. Later that day, two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm, and the Hurricane Research Division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00UTC on September10.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeast United States before heading out to sea. The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E

5|$|The JTWC issued {{advisories}} on Faxai, designating it as 20W; {{however, they}} classified it as a tropical depression. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition, with convection persisting {{mainly in the}} northwestern portion of the storm and cold, dry air entering into the southwestern portion. At 1200UTC, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Juaning as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 20W (Faxai) had become extratropical around this <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> merged with a baroclinic zone. A cold front developed along the southern portion of Faxai, a feature of extratropical cyclones. Around that time, the JMA upgraded Faxai to a severe tropical storm with winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained).|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was a common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting {{is a combination of}} intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
5|$|The chapel, {{which is}} on a small hill to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century.

Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short nave and a large six-light west window, and that the chapel was disused by this <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had no roof. The west façade of the chapel was later demolished and the chancel arch was built up {{to form a new}} one with a Gibbs surround. A bell-turret was added c.1805.

5|$|The storm {{held its}} {{strength}} for some <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> moved southward between Ono-i-Lau and Tongatapu. Beginning to accelerate, Vaianu entered {{the area of}} responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. It curved southeastward and slowly deteriorated due to increasing wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures. The JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm on February 15, and {{by the next day}} it was undergoing an extratropical transition. At 0600 UTC, the JTWC classified it as extratropical, but it remained a powerful storm system for several days as it tracked over the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E
