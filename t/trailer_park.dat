Additionally, the rising waters washed out several bridges {{in the region and}} swept away automobiles. Railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation. Drinking water in Dartmouth was contaminated due to excessive runoff into Lake Antigonish, and a <b>trailer</b> <b>park</b> in Antigonish flooded, prompting 600 residents to evacuate. Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated at between $3.5 million and $5.1 million USD. One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of {{the snow}} and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, very cold and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood <b>trailer</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a <b>trailer</b> <b>park</b> near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E

5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns and washing out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away a <b>trailer</b> <b>park</b> in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
5|$|From September 2 to September 3, large waves, some {{as high as}} , {{impacted}} beaches throughout southern California, with Los Angeles and Orange Counties experiencing growing breakers, and Cabrillo Beach experiencing riptides for {{two days}} straight. Due to the Labor Day beach turnout, many reports of rescuing swimmers who were swept up by waves caused by the hurricane were received. On September 2, forty-seven swimmers in Zuma Beach had to be rescued despite warnings {{to stay out of}} deep water, and an additional 261 rescues were reported in Newport. More rescues were reported the next day, although no exact total from the second day is known. At the El Morro Beach <b>Trailer</b> <b>Park</b> near Laguna Beach, a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) were ripped from their supports by rough seas. Long Beach, in terms of damage, was particularly hit hard by Liza, with debris and sea foam from the heavy surf clogging storm drains. A group of tidal pools formed along an area of the beach, draining out from a parking lot on 72nd Street onto Ocean Boulevard, resulting in flooding that closed a section of the boulevard between 68th Place and 72nd Place to traffic. Various flower gardens were also reported to have been swamped by the flooding, but no damage to housing was reported. The weakened properties in West Newport Beach also sustained no additional damage.|$|E
