500|$|The most {{important}} aspect of Todd's appearance for St. John was his character's hair. His preference was that Todd's hair was a little shorter; he told Soap Opera Weekly (SOW) that he thought that Todd's hair was too [...] "shaggy", which was not his personal style, and that he hoped the writers and producers would let him <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> a bit. When he first got the role, St. John's hair resembled Howarth's shorter chin-length haircut, which was initially worn from 2000 to 2003, and St. John was told by the writers and producers not to change his hair until further notice. St. John [...] "made the creative choice [...] go because [...] not really right in the old noggin, and gained weight for the role.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{songs on}} the {{international}} album were edited from the full-length versions on the original Australian album. The full-length [...] "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" [...] has {{the title of the}} song chanted four times, starting at 3:09, but on the edited version the chant is heard only twice. [...] "Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)" [...] lasted 7:29 on the Australian album but was faded out early to 6:57 on the international version. This means they <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the Chuck Berry licks and title chanting to the end; however, both these full-length versions were restored on the 1994 Atco Records remastered CD of the international album. The most recent 2003 CD edition by Epic Records goes back to the edited versions, as originally on the 1976 and 1981 international vinyl editions. The uncut versions of both songs were released on the 2009 box set Backtracks. On the original version of [...] "Rocker", included on the Australian T.N.T. album, the song lasts 2:55 and cuts out abruptly as the guitar riff hits its peak. Conversely, all international editions of the [...] "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap" [...] album have a slightly shorter version where the song fades out at 2:50 before the cut. [...] "Squealer" [...] appears to be longer by thirteen seconds on the international version; this is due to it having a bumper of silence at the end, as it is the final track on the record. [...] "Ride On" [...] has a four-second difference (longer on the international version) which appears to be from a minor speed issue, although the last guitar slide can be heard better on the shorter Australian version.|$|E

40|$|Clustering {{procedures}} {{allowing for}} general covariance {{structures of the}} obtained clusters need some constraints on the solutions. With this in mind, several proposals have been introduced in the literature. The TCLUST procedure works with a restriction on the "eigenvalues-ratio" of the clusters scatter matrices. In {{order to try to}} achieve robustness with respect to outliers, the procedure allows to <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> a proportion of the most outlying observations. The resistance to infinitesimal contamination of the TCLUST has already been studied. This paper aims to look at its resistance to a higher amount of contamination by means of the study of its breakdown behavior. The rather new concept of restricted breakdown point will demonstrate that the TCLUST procedure resists to a proportion of contamination equal to the trimming rate as soon as the data set is sufficiently "well clustered".

40|$|The present public {{telephone}} networks <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the lowband (50 – 300 Hz) and the highband (3400 – 7000 Hz) {{components of}} sounds. As a result, telephone speech {{is characterized by}} thin and muffled sounds, and degraded speaker identification. The lowband components are deterministically recoverable, while the missing highband can be recovered statistically. We develop an equalizer to restore the lowband parts. The highband parts are filled in using a linear prediction approach. The highband excitation is generated using a bandpass envelope modulated Gaussian signal and the spectral envelope is generated using a Gaussian Mixture Model. The mean log-spectrum distortion decreases by 0. 96 dB, comparing to a previous method using wideband reconstruction with a VQ codebook mapping algorithm. Informal subjective tests show that the reconstructed wideband speech enhances lowband sounds and regenerates realistic highband components. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} control method {{to absorb the}} landing force or the ground {{reaction}} force for a stable dynamic walking of a humanoid robot. Humanoid robot may become unstable during walking due to the impulsive contact force of the sudden landing of its foot. Therefore, a control method to decrease the landing force is required. In this paper, time-domain passivity control approach is applied for this purpose. Ground and {{the foot of the}} robot are modeled as two one-port network systems that are connected, and exchange energy with each other. The time-domain passivity controller with admittance causality is implemented, which has the landing force as input and foot’s position to <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the force as output. The proposed landing force controller can enhance the stability of the walking robot from simple computation. The small-sized humanoid robot, HanSaRam-VII that has 27 DOFs, is developed to verify the proposed scheme through dynamic walking experiments.
