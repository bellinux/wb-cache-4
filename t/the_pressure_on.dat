Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E

Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the applicability of <b>the</b> tactile <b>pressure</b> sensors for <b>the</b> measurement of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> a loaded conveyor belt. Theoretical models have been developed to predict <b>the</b> dynamic <b>pressure</b> caused by <b>the</b> bulk material on the belt. However, there has been no satisfactory sensors or procedures for the direct measurement of <b>the</b> <b>pressure.</b> Recent advance in tactile sensing technology provides a potential. Using a tactile pressure sensor Tekscan 5315, we measured <b>the</b> normal <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> a running belt in an in-situ belt conveyor facility with varied loading capacities. We conducted comparisons of measurements from <b>the</b> tactile <b>pressure</b> sensor and well-established independent instruments. The errors of measurements from <b>the</b> tactile <b>pressure</b> sensor were calculated. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> mapping <b>on</b> a loaded belt was presented.

Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison would be the first of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that this created, together with his role as a hands-on record company boss, meant that <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Harrison was immense.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the war to mid-1941, Coastal Command had only one {{functioning}} Operational Training Unit (OTU). Officially it had to provide training for 17 units. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the OTU was such that it offered little more than a conversion programme for pilots and crews hoping to man land-based aircraft. In 1940, Bomber Command was asked to support Coastal forces, even though at that time in the war it overstretched itself. Requests to the Air Ministry to meet outstanding OTU requirements were largely ignored. The single landplane OTU was established to train 1.1 crews per month. This figure, on the outbreak of war, proved grossly inadequate.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Army of Northern Virginia won {{a major victory}} over the Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Chancellorsville (April 30 May 6, 1863), Robert E.
