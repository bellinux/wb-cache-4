40|$|ABSTRACT. Knowledge of {{the total}} number of {{vehicles}} active on the road (TNVAR) is an important input in planning and managing road transportation system. Such figure is not available in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This paper presents a modeling-based methodology to estimate TNVAR. The model is composed of three sub-models that estimate the number of vehicles leaving service due <b>to</b> <b>re-export,</b> accidents, or retirement by wear and tear, respectively. It uses as its inputs available annual vehicle registration, export, and accident statistics. Three different decay functions were considered for the retirement sub-model: power, exponential and logit. The model was calibrated using the 1403 H TNVAR, when all vehicles were asked to re-register, and the 1410 H vehicle age mix data obtained from Motor Vehicle Inspection Program (MVIP). Results show that the power decay function gives the best fit of the data, and that the average vehicle life is 11 year. The calibrated model was then applied to regenerate the TNVAR for the period 1403 - 1419 H. The model-predicted 1419 H TNVAR, about 1. 8 million, was used to validate the model, by comparing it with the corresponding actual figure, obtained from the new alpha-numerical license plate re-issue statistics. The paper demonstrates two applications of the calibrated and validated model: 1403 - 1419 H historical trends of accidents, injuries and fatalities rates, per 1000 vehicles, and that of vehicle ownership rate per capita.

40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae intron-containing pre-tRNAs are {{exported}} {{from the}} nucleus to the cytoplasm for {{removal of the}} introns, and the spliced tRNAs are returned to the nucleus {{for reasons that are}} not understood. The re-imported spliced tRNAs are then subjected to aminoacylation in the nucleolus to ensure that they are functional prior <b>to</b> <b>re-export</b> to the cytoplasm. Previous studies have shown that re-imported spliced tRNAs and mature tRNAs made entirely in the nucleus from intronless precursors are retained in the nucleus of S. cerevisiae in response to glucose, amino acid, nitrogen or inorganic phosphate deprivation. Contrary to these studies, we recently reported that starvation of S. cerevisiae of amino acids or nitrogen results in nuclear accumulation of re-imported spliced tRNAs, but not tRNAs made from intronless precursors. This finding suggests that separate pathways are used for nuclear export of retrogradely transported spliced tRNAs and tRNAs made from intronless pre-tRNAs. In addition, the data support the conclusion that the nuclear re-export pathway for retrogradely transported spliced tRNAs, but not the pathway responsible for nuclear export of tRNAs derived from intronless precursors is regulated during amino acid or nitrogen starvation. This regulation appears to occur at a step after the re-imported spliced tRNAs have undergone aminoacylation quality assurance and, in part, involves the TORC 1 signalling pathway. Moreover, it was established that Utp 9 p is an intranuclear component that only facilitates nuclear re-export of retrogradely transported spliced tRNAs by the β-karyopherin Msn 5 p. Utp 9 p acts in concert with Utp 8 p, a key player in nuclear tRNA export in S. cerevisiae, to translocate aminoacylated re-imported spliced tRNAs from the nucleolus to Msn 5 p and assist with formation of the Msn 5 p-tRNA-Gsp 1 p-GTP export complex. This pathway, however, {{is not the only one}} responsible for nuclear re-export of retrogradely transported spliced tRNAs...|$|E
