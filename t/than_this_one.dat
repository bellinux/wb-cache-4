Taylor's finishing in the high scoring match proved to be the difference and included checkouts of 167 and 160. The players hit 32 180s between them breaking the PDC record of 31 which was set in the 2007 World Championship final, a match which had 32 more legs <b>than</b> <b>this</b> <b>one.</b> Both players described the game as the greatest they had been involved in afterwards.

25|$|In Euclidean geometry, {{a figure}} can be scaled up or scaled down indefinitely, and the {{resulting}} figures are similar, i.e., {{they have the same}} angles and the same internal proportions. In elliptic geometry this is not the case. For example, in the spherical model we can see that the distance between any two points must be strictly less than half the circumference of the sphere (because antipodal points are identified). A line segment therefore cannot be scaled up indefinitely. A geometer measuring the geometrical properties of the space he or she inhabits can detect, via measurements, that there is a certain distance scale that is a property of the space. On scales much smaller <b>than</b> <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> the space is approximately flat, geometry is approximately Euclidean, and figures can be scaled up and down while remaining approximately similar.|$|E
25|$|As with genera, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} variation {{in the number of}} recorded pitta species. The checklists of Sclater and Elliot {{at the end of the}} 19th century contained 48 and 47 species each. More recent checklists have had fewer <b>than</b> <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> listing just 24 species. Since the 1990s the figure has been between 30 and 32 species; the 2003 Handbook of the Birds of the World recognises 30. One species not recognised by the Handbook is the black-crowned pitta, which is treated as a subspecies of either the garnet pitta or the graceful pitta. Since the puplication of the handbook more splits have occurred; in 2010 the banded pitta was split into three species, one endemic to Java and Bali, one endemic to Borneo and one found in Sumatra and the Thai-Malay Peninsula. A 2013 study found that the red-bellied pitta, a widespread species found from Sulawesi to Australia, was actually a species complex. The study divided the species into 17 new species, although authorities like the IOC have recognised only 10.|$|E

2500|$|Smith captained England in 25 of his 50 Test match appearances, but in {{a period}} rich in batting talent he was rarely {{guaranteed}} a place. His uncertainty against fast bowling was exposed {{by a series of}} low scores in the mid 1960s, and Smith faced considerable press criticism, unusual for the time. Still, he was a good tourist and was made captain of the England tour of India in 1963–64 when Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey were unavailable and without England's top bowlers Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. He lost the toss five times in a row and had so many injuries and illnesses that in the Second Test at Madras Smith had to use three batsmen, two wicket-keepers and six bowlers. When Mickey Stewart was unable to play after the first day because of dysentery he seriously considered calling up the cricket journalist Henry Blofeld, but managed to survive with just 10 men. Smith became the first England captain to draw all five Tests in a series (it was the third time India had done this) and was considered to have done well to avoid defeat. It was his best series with 306 runs (51.00) and when Ted Dexter retired after losing 1–0 to Bobby Simpson's Australia in 1964 Smith was made captain for England's last tour of South Africa before the Basil d'Oliveira Crisis. He won 1–0 against the talented Springboks, the last captain to defeat them in a Test series until 1996–97. It was also a personal success as he took four catches in the vital First Test and 10 in the series. He also made his third and last Test century, a top-score of 121 in England's 442 as they replied to South Africa's 501/7 in the Third Test, and finished with 257 runs (42.83).
