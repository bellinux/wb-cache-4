5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved to be very difficult <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>at</b> night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E

Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who has to visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech he is going <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>at</b> The Waldorf Astoria. Tracy eventually appears on Late Night only to immediately fall asleep after sitting down.|$|E

25|$|The ancient {{library of}} the White Monastery {{is rich in}} many {{categories}} such biblical, hagiographical, liturgical, etc. This provides the researcher with good knowledge about what the monks were reading {{and what they were}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>at</b> different stages of the monastery development. However, the early times are not too well represented in the surviving fragments, This can be either attributed to their frequent use or simply they were victims of time and of decline of the monastery in later times. The dialect of these manuscripts were predominantly in Sahidic Coptic, which was perfected in its literary form by Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite. There were also some bilingual manuscripts. The early ones were in Sahidic Coptic and Greek, while the latter ones had Sahidic Coptic and Arabic. The writing material employed were mostly parchment, because of its prevalence, but some of the later ones were found on paper.|$|E
25|$|During {{the metal}} type era, all type {{was cut in}} metal and could only be printed at a {{specific}} size. It was a natural process to vary a design at different sizes, making it chunkier and clearer <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>at</b> smaller sizes. Many digital fonts are offered {{in a range of}} styles for different sizes, especially designs sold for professional printing use by companies such as Adobe. The art of designing fonts for a specific size is known as optical sizing. Others will be offered in only one style, but optimised for a specific size. Designs intended to be printed small may feature larger lower-case letters, chunkier stroke weights and thicker serifs, while fonts intended for display may be more slender. Optical sizes are particularly common for serif fonts, since the fine detail of serif fonts can need to be bulked up for smaller sizes.|$|E
