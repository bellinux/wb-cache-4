50|$|The maresha is the Gurage name, {{also the}} same word used by the Amhara, for a digging stick that differs in {{construction}} because of its forked form. It is used primarily to dig holes for construction, planting, and harvesting roots and tubers. This tool {{is used as a}} plow to turn over the soil of an entire field before planting. It is used <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>clods</b> of soil in areas where the soil is hard or in areas that may be too steep for plowing, and to dig holes for construction or to transplant domestic plants.

5000|$|In agriculture, a harrow (often {{called a}} set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an {{implement}} for breaking up and smoothing out {{the surface of the}} soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up <b>clods</b> (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing. Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds).|$|R
40|$|Imagine {{that you}} are {{entering}} an unknown field {{and would like to}} estimate the productivity of the unfamiliar soil. You may pick up a handful of soil to evaluate its color and texture. You also can feel how difficult it is <b>to</b> <b>break</b> a <b>clod</b> apart, roll it into a ball or press out a ribbon. After repeating this procedure at different field locations, soil depths and times, you get a feeling of both spatial and temporal soil variability. Some of this variability can explain the non-uniformity of crop yield. If you collect soil samples and send them to a soil-testing laboratory, you can get a standardized measure of soil nutrient levels and other characteristics. The greater the sampling density, the more likely you are to obtain a good representation of the variability of soil properties across the field. This process, however, takes time and money, both when sampling and in the lab, and limits the number of soil samples which can be justified economically...|$|R
5000|$|The {{heavy duty}} disc with large {{diameter}} disc blades of 26", 28", 30", 32", 36", and 40", and with increased disc spacings of 10", 14", and 18" [...] {{are the primary}} tillage tools that are used <b>to</b> <b>break</b> virgin ground, <b>to</b> incorporate residue into the soil {{in preparation for a}} ripper / subsoiler, and <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up a compacted soil in order to increase soil aeration and to promote soil permeability in lower levels of the soil profile. Prior to a planting operation, a secondary disc harrow with narrow disc spacing of 8", 9", and even 10" [...] with disc sizes ranging from 20", 22", 24", to 26" [...] can be used. Other similar secondary tillage tine implements or rotary harrows are also widely used. When choosing secondary tillage equipment, soil type as well as soil moisture content at the time must be considered. Lighter secondary disc harrows are primarily used <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down soil <b>clods</b> into smaller pieces. By so doing, water penetrates more easily into the soil, soil aeration is increased, and the activity of soil biota is enhanced; the final result is a seed bed that is suitable for planting.|$|R
40|$|Wind erosion {{has been}} {{observed}} on some fields shortly after a rainstorm. Chepil (4) noted {{that some of the}} coaxse soil grains left loose on the surface following rainfall contributed to the ini-tial stages of wind erosion. Such coarse grains remain on the surface after dispersal of surface soil by raindrop impact and splash (3, 4). Crust formation associated with rainfall presumably would reduce wind erosion by increasing bulk density and lowering aggregation (8). Soil crust-ing is also associated with soil salinity (2, 3, 7, 9, 10). Wind erodibility of soiIs following rainstorms of various intensities and relatively short dura-tions have not been studied extensively. Little, if any, information exists on the influence of various salts on a soil's susceptibility to move-ment by wind. Reported here are the combined effects of added salts, rainfall intensity, and rainfall dura-tion on wind erodibility and mechanical strength of a sandy soil. MATERIALS AND mTHODS The experimental variables are listed in table 1. The study was a factorial experiment in a com-pletely random design with three replications of each combination. The various salts were added to a Pratt loamy fine sand (table 2) and thoroughly mixed in a cement mixer to produce an electrical conduc-tivity (ECe) of about 12 mmhos. /cm., as de-termined from a saturation extract.

6000|$|My dear honoured friend,--Yours, dated Edinburgh, which I {{have just}} read, makes me very unhappy. [...] "Almost blind and wholly deaf" [...] are melancholy news of human nature; but when {{told of a}} much-loved and honoured friend, they carry misery in the sound. Goodness on your part, and {{gratitude}} on mine, began a tie which has gradually entwisted itself among the dearest chords of my bosom, and I tremble at the omens of your late and present ailing habit and shattered health. You miscalculate matters widely, when you forbid my waiting on you, lest it should hurt my worldly concerns. My small scale of farming is exceedingly more simple and easy than what you have lately seen at Moreham Mains. But, {{be that as it}} may, the heart of the man and the fancy of the poet are the two grand considerations for which I live: if miry ridges and dirty dunghills are to engross {{the best part of the}} functions of my soul immortal, I had better been a rook or a magpie at once, and then I should not have been plagued with any ideas superior <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> of <b>clods</b> and picking up grubs; not to mention barn-door cocks of mallards, creatures with which I could almost exchange lives at any time. If you continue so deaf, I am afraid a visit will be no great pleasure to either of us; but if I hear you are got so well again as to be able to relish conversation, look you to it, Madam, for I will make my threatenings good. I am to be at the New-year-day fair of Ayr, and, by all that is sacred in the world, friend, I will come and see you.|$|R

The main result of the experiments is summarized in a 3 D diagram where the specific energy requirement for soil clod crushing is given in the function of the moisture content and the plasticity index for different clay soils...|$|R
40|$|Enterprise {{costs and}} returns vary over farms {{and over time}} for any {{particular}} farm. Variability stems from differences in: Capital, labor, land and management resources Type and size of machinery complement Cultural practices Size of farm and enterprise Crop yields Input prices Commodity prices Costs can also be calculated differently depending on the intended use of the cost estimate. The information in this publication represents costs and returns of a case study Adams County, Washington farmer using both the low-disturbance V-sweep undercutter conservation tillage * and traditional tillage systems for summer fallow. To avoid drawing unwarranted conclusions from this case study, you should closely examine the assumptions and data used. If these are not suitable for the situation at hand, you should make appropriate adjustments. *The Haybuster TM undercutter implement {{used in this study}} has 32 -inch wide V-shaped blades with 28 -inch spacing between blades (on two tiers) to slice below the soil surface with minimum soil lifting. As a primary spring tillage implement, the undercutter completely severs capillary pores to halt liquid water movement towards the soil surface as required to retain seed-zone moisture in summer fallow. The pitch of each blade can be individually adjusted to ensure uniform horizontal movement (i. e., minimum soil lifting) underneath the soil. This implement can be easily fitted to deliver aqua nitrogen fertilizer at the time of primary spring tillage. Depending on soil texture, farmers may or may not want to attach a finishing implement behind the undercutter <b>to</b> <b>break</b> large soil <b>clods</b> and fill air voids. In addition, the undercutter works well for killing Russian thistles, if needed, after wheat harvest...|$|R

50|$|The {{agreement}} was highly unfavourable to Henry and Edward, {{but it must}} be assumed that they agreed to it under duress, since Edward was held hostage by the barons after the defeat at Lewes. On 15 August the document was dispatched to King Louis IX of France, who previously had been acting as an arbiter between the two parties. Louis had already rejected the terms of the Mise of Lewes; the stricter conditions of the Peace of Canterbury might have been intended to bring pressure on the French king, to help bring about a settlement. King Louis, however, rejected the proposition in angry terms. He was reported to have said that he would rather <b>break</b> <b>clods</b> behind a plough than have this sort of kingly rule. Montfort's government after this gradually started running into problems. In the spring of 1265, Gloucester defected {{to the side of the}} royalists, and Edward managed to escape his captivity. The baronial rule came to an end on 4 August 1265, when Montfort was defeated and killed at the Battle of Evesham, and Henry was restored to full powers.|$|R
40|$|Walking {{around on}} a {{perfectly}} manicured golf course, it's easy to forget most of the plant is below ground. It almost {{goes without saying that}} proper soil management is vital in turf management. The best kind of soil structure for plant growth is granular structure, which resembles cookie crumbs and is usually less than 0. 5 centimeter in diameter. One important soil property that can be easily overlooked is soil structure or tilth. Soil structure refers to the spatial arrangement of soil particles. These aggregates form through physical, chemical and biological processes, which will greatly influence soil quality (Brady and Weil, 2008). Good soil structure is a hallmark of healthy soil. If soils are healthy, then healthy turf can follow. An easy way to determine soil structure quality is to collect surface soil between 5 centimeters (cm) and 10 cm deep. Gently toss the soil in {{the palm of your hand}} <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up the soil. Take a representative soil clod and gently try <b>to</b> <b>break</b> it apart. If the <b>clod</b> <b>breaks</b> or fractures along a plane, it means you have some structure. If the clod tears apart, then it's a clear indication you have very poor or no structure...|$|R
