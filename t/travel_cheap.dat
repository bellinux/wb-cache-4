40|$|Possibly {{unnoticed by}} many, the {{fundamental}} {{notion of what}} it means to be an immigrant is changing rapidly. Aihwa Ong (1999), for example, argues the need for a new category, transnationals, consisting of people who not only hold citizenship or resident status in two countries, but in fact live in both of them, in commuter fashion. All this is of course facilitated by technology—fast air <b>travel,</b> <b>cheap</b> telephone communication, e-mail, and the like. In his book, Virtual Migration: the Programming of Globalization (Duke University Press, 2006), A. Aneesh takes this a step further. The impact of technology is so profound that many now “migrate ” without leaving their home towns. Importation of labor, one of the traditional goals of immigration policy, is now reversed: Modern technological mechanisms now make it easier to move the work rather than move the workers, and offshoring of information technology (IT) work is booming. Contemporaneously, we are seeing an evolution of power, with control flowing now to computers and those who program and run them, a phenomenon Aneesh calls algocracy—government by the computer algorithm. As the work moves abroad from the country to which power is applied, power shifts as well. Take something as simple as withdrawing cash from a bank. Aneesh points out that with an automatic teller machine, no step in the transaction is negotiable, in contrast to one’s traditional interaction with a human teller. We must respond to the questions put to us by the ATM—and only those questions. The same nonnegotiable nature of the process occurs online, when one reviews one’s bank account, submits computerized applications for jobs and schools, purchases goods and services, and so on. Even one’s interaction with humans can be controlled to a large extent by machine. One might call the bank to inquire about an account error, but a machin...|$|E

An econometric study of domestic air fares for 1995 and 2000 is used to address the following questions: How does the level of competition on a particular route or in a particular airport affect fares Does competition from low-cost airlines have an especially large effect on fares Do hub-and-spoke systems make air <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper</b> for the consumer...|$|R

50|$|Between 2006 and 2014, American {{intercity}} buses {{focused on}} medium-haul trips between 200 and 300 miles; airplanes performed {{the bulk of}} longer trips and automobiles shorter ones. For most medium-haul trips curbside bus fares were less {{than the cost of}} automobile gasoline, and one tenth that of Amtrak. Buses are also four times more fuel-efficient than automobiles. Their Wi-Fi service is also popular; one study estimated that 92% of Megabus and BoltBus passengers planned to use an electronic device. New lower fares introduced by Greyhound on traditional medium-distance routes and rising gasoline prices have increased ridership across the network and made bus <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper</b> than all alternatives.|$|R

50|$|If {{the demand}} for energy {{services}} remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy services cheaper, and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper,</b> consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. These are examples of the direct rebound effect.|$|R

50|$|After earlier envisioning Hyperloop, Musk {{assigned}} a dozen engineers from Tesla and SpaceX {{who worked for}} nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system. An early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs. Musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make Hyperloop <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper</b> than any other mode of transport for such long distances. The alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce air drag. The alpha design document estimated {{the total cost of}} an LA-to-SF Hyperloop system at , but this amount is speculative.|$|R

40|$|We {{know that}} several {{chemicals}} {{can be combined}} to form explosives. Therefore, {{we do not want}} these to end up in airplanes together. Similarly, in the architecture of complex systems, it is often possible to combine the results of several system services to acquire illegitimate benefits or disrupt operation. For example, in what is called simboxing, telephone services are purchased from different providers, and a composite service is set up which redirects incoming calls to the service purchased from the target provider, bypassing interconnection fees. Due to their complex nature, such attacks are extremely hard to predict and prevent. This paper provides a first systematic description and classification of the phenomenon of system abuse by service composition, as well as an analysis to identify the most common types of attacks in the design phase. We employ attack trees to express ways to achieve the goal of obtaining a service at a cost lower than the regular amount charged. We use the purchase of railway tickets as a running example, where the atomic services are the rights to travel between two directly adjacent stations. These can potentially be composed in various ways to <b>travel</b> <b>cheaper,</b> for example where there are stations A, B, and C on a railway line, and a single ticket from B to A via C is cheaper than a return ticket from B to C.

50|$|Before {{the start}} of the 21st century, the {{electrodynamic}} tether being oriented at an angle to the local vertical between the object and a planet with a magnetic field cut the Earth's magnetic field and generated a current; thereby it converted some of the orbiting body's kinetic energy to electrical energy.

As part of a tether propulsion system, crafts can use long, strong conductors to change the orbits of spacecraft. It has the potential to make space <b>travel</b> significantly <b>cheaper.</b> It is a simplified, very low-budget magnetic sail. It can be used either to accelerate or brake an orbiting spacecraft. When direct current is pumped through the tether, it exerts a force against the magnetic field, and the tether accelerates the spacecraft.|$|R
