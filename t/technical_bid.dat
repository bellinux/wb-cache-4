The REL-Hyundai consortium was initially disqualified at the <b>technical</b> <b>bid</b> stage as Hyundai did not meet the criteria of $200 million net worth specified in the bid document. However, the consortium challenged the disqualification in the Supreme Court, and the Court granted them 90 days to submit their bid that ended on 15 December 2007.

40|$|Written from a {{professional}} practitioner‟s perspective, this paper examines {{the extent to}} which the approach and examples identified in the context of European Union (EU) procurement rules by projects such as “Innovation Through Sustainable Public Procurement ” (published as “Smart SPP”) might be applicable in other jurisdictions to support its aspiration to provide a globally applicable model of best practice for procuring the innovative technologies required for sustainable development and improved environmental performance. It considers the outcome and recommendations of Smart SPP as a means of engaging with small and medium-sized enterprise and with universities and technical institutions to stimulate research and to enable the commercialization of new technology. It identifies elements of India‟s Public Procurement Bill that would allow adoption of those best practice recommendations to ensure that the legislation, once in force, would have the capacity to move beyond its initial concern with the creation of robust anti-corruption measures to the broader social and economic benefits to be derived from public sector involvement in the innovation process. It concludes, however, that the adoption of an approach similar to that advocated by Smart SPP would create a significant requirement for training and professional development among procurement professionals to accommodate the complexity and sophistication of “outcome specification ” and the evaluation of widely differing <b>technical</b> <b>bids...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The hosting of mega events encapsulates {{different}} {{opportunities and}} benefits for host countries or regions. Event management constitutes {{one of the}} most exciting and fastest growing forms of leisure, business and tourism-related phenomena. Their special appeal stems from the limited duration and innate uniqueness of each event, which distinguishes them from permanent institutions and built attractions. Events and festivals have the ability to attract a large number of visitors for a specific time period to a specific destination. The frequency of events is evident for the success of a tourism destination. The hosting of mega events requires a detailed process of bidding for international events. This study focused on the bidding process for hosting such events, with specific reference to the role of government in the bidding process. The value of this study lies in the key success factors that were identified by a comparative analysis that was done between the FlFA 2006 Soccer Bid between Germany and South Africa. Although South Africa's bid was unsuccessful, the country still delivered an outstanding <b>technical</b> <b>bid</b> and is regarded as a serious competitor for future events. South Africa already proved itself, through hosting the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Two major recommendations were made, including a FlFA World Cup Information Centre and a checklist for successful bidding. The FlFA World Cup Information Centre's aim must be to provide and disseminate information to communities. This will not only encourage community involvement. but also create support for the event. The marketing programme, staff information, maintenance plans, ecological balance, budget concerns, event evaluation process, the role of the organising committee and security matters are the key factors in developing such a centre. The checklist for creating a successful bid cover a number of issues regarding operational planning and management. Master...|$|E
40|$|Some {{extensive}} researches {{have been}} undertaken on raw concrete, structural use {{of concrete and}} concrete production although a less concern has been given on the aspects of optimizing cost, quality and time (CTQ) objectives in concrete production. The degree of control over cost, quality and time overruns by client {{is limited to a}} certain extent during implementation stage of a project associated with more concrete based works due to various reasons. However, during the initial stage of a project (i. e. in initial procurement stage) the client has a sound control over cost and quality aspects of producing concrete. In this study the main objective was to develop a methodology to evaluate the performance of constructors in producing concrete introducing a scoring system in <b>technical</b> <b>bid</b> evaluation since concrete production is an essential and an expensive item in construction projects. First relationships of cost and quality parameters (Unit production cost-U, Wastage- Ws, Concrete strength-S, and Workability- W) were developed against the Rate of concrete production (R - Time parameter) using regression analysis using collected data from few national construction projects. Then a range of R was generated from 5 to 25 (m 3 /Hour) for different 81 constructors, fitting the best curves for above four relationships. The collected data were also analyzed statistically and descriptive statistic results were reviewed including mean, standard deviations, confidential intervals (Cl) at different confidence levels. Then the calculated S, W, U and Ws for above range of R were contrasted separately within their CI at 90 %, 95 %, 99 %, 99. 99 % confidence levels for 81 constructors. The evaluating constructors for each parameter were done giving scores based on the CI within which the calculated parameter lays on for the range of R from 5 to 25 (m 3 /Hour). Finally total score obtained by each constructor (bidder) was determined and reviewed by adding individual scores of S, W, U and Ws with different weightings. The final out put wa...|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of consultant's performance {{is crucial to}} the success of a consulting assignment especially when today's construction projects are becoming more sophisticated, large-scale, and risky. However, since individual clients have developed their own consultant's performance evaluation (CPE) procedures, the sharing of performance information, though desirable, may not be too meaningful as the results of evaluation could be inconsistent. There is a need to examine whether a unified framework can be derived for CPE. The aim {{of this paper is to}} improve the transparency and rigorousness of CPE through the establishment of an evaluating framework for gauging the performance of engineering consultants. In this paper, a comprehensive set of evaluation criteria is identified, and the significance of these criteria is discussed through an empirical survey. Then, a multicriteria model for evaluating the performance of engineering consultants is presented. The results indicate that once an acceptable CPE framework is devised, the performance scores can be utilized for various purposes, including monitor and control, incentive and sanction, preselection, <b>technical</b> assessment, and <b>bid</b> evaluation. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Sri Lanka {{has made}} a {{significant}} development in the telecommunications sector {{since the inception of}} sector reforms in 1991, resulting in a competitive market environment. The results of liberalization have been impressive, with the telecommunications sector growing at one of the fastest paces in Asia. Along with above rapid growth of telecommunication industry, the numbers of antenna towers also have been increased from about 400 (in 1990) up to nearly 5100 towers during the last two decades. During the above boom period of development, some aspects of safety and reliability seem to have been overlooked. This report provides detailed discussion on the technical aspects of steel lattice antenna tower designs, codes of practice and different factors of safety. Postcollapse assessments of four incidences of recently collapsed tall antenna towers in Sri Lanka are also included in this report. Several shortcomings existing in currently available <b>technical</b> specifications, tender <b>bidding</b> processes and construction were also highlighted. The possible solutions and methods for eliminating above mentioned shortcomings are also discussed in detail. The void that exists in telecommunication industry due to the absence of properly qualified structural engineering experts are also highlighted. Further to that, the resulting negative effects such as neglecting public safety, lower reliability of telecommunication network, high possibility of accidents occurring, etc. are discussed in detail. The cost of construction vs safety of antenna towers is discussed with a desk study. Effectiveness of some common practices and beliefs which are influencing current antenna tower constructions are also discussed. Concluding remarks along with several basic recommendations are supplied for correcting the present mistakes while making more reliable telecommunication networks as well as ensuring public safety...|$|R
30|$|To aid {{managers}} in bid/no bid decisions making, many decision methods for bidding {{have been proposed}} to assist the construction managers making better decision-making in an uncertain biding environment. Many scholars have proposed techniques for bid decision-making. However, traditional models for bid decision-making tend to utilize quantitative tools, just as economic models, mathematical programming, etc. which {{managers in}} both theoretical and practical did not show interest in such models (Irtishad 1990). The complexity {{of the problem is}} so overwhelming that even the very experienced contracting managers feel that the bid/no-bid decisions should have a better technique tool for archiving. El-Mashaleh (2013) concluded key bidding variables that are considered by contractors when evaluating bids. Senior managers of contracting industry were interviewed to identify variables that affect biding and data envelopment analysis (DEA) developed to use in the tender decision. Boussabaine and Lewis (2003), proposed a novel tender decision method utility the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. A back-propagation ANN consisting of an input layer with 18 input nodes, two hidden layers and output layer with one node was developed. Chou et al. (2015) proposed an method for estimating project award prices utilizing artificial intelligence (AI)-based bid/no <b>bid</b> <b>technical</b> as well as an auxiliary tool that contract managers can use to make bid/no bid decision-making. This research optimizing AI models that predict bid award amounts for bridge projects. Chou et al. (2013) developed a new bid/no bid decision-making strategy to support the decision-making that is based on a combined framework of the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and regression-based simulation. In a word, new methods of artificial intelligence(AI) have been widely used in tender decision with the increasing development of science and computer technology (Deng et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2015). Among them, the BP artificial neural networks(ANN) algorithm has been extensive used, but the practical application of the algorithm has certain limitations due to it is easily trapped in local minima and the poor convergence performance. In view of some defects existing in the traditional bid/no bid forecast methods and the problem of insufficient predicted sample amount of historical data, this paper developed a novel approach integrating rough sets with GRNN neural network based on NPSO algorithm to bid/no-bid decisions. It can not only overcoming the defects that the network is easy to fall into local minimum, poor convergence and etc., but also improve and optimize the generalization capability and performance of the network through NPSO- GRNN neural network algorithm.|$|R
