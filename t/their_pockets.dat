5|$|As {{part of the}} coaster's major refurbishment, a new, {{original}} storyline {{was added}} with a completely redesigned queue experience that places guests inside a perilous scientific experiment led by General Thaddeus Ross. The entrance features a statue of Hulk holding one of the ride's vehicles over his head, and arching tracks passing over him. These arching coaster tracks came from the original Hulk Roller Coaster. The televisions now show CGI animations of test subjects being exposed to gamma radiation and being transformed into Hulk-like creatures. As of April 2015, riders must pass through metal detectors and security personnel and must rid themselves of all loose items from <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{extension}} of Novardok's unconventional approach entailed {{the establishment of}} numerous branches of the yeshiva. The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without money in <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> simultaneously abstaining from speech and not asking for a ride or even food. Upon reaching a town, they would enter the Beth Midrash, and without a word to anyone, study Torah.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minority}} practices include paper preparations, {{where the}} substance and dilution are written on {{pieces of paper}} and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, {{and the use of}} radionics to manufacture preparations. Such practices have been strongly criticized by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a player}} sinks {{one of the}} opponent's balls there is no penalty. However, the ball is {{considered}} sunk regardless of which pocket it drops in. If a player sinks {{one of his own}} balls (but not the last) in <b>their</b> opponent's <b>pocket,</b> the opponent may drop two balls into <b>their</b> <b>pocket.</b> [...] A player sinking their last ball in the wrong pocket loses the game. [...] If a player causes a ball to leave the table, their opponent may place that ball anywhere on the table (usually in the middle space surrounded by bumpers) and may (depending on local custom) drop two of their balls into <b>their</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} ski resorts have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers {{hands-free}} access to ski lifts.

25|$|Adding {{secondary}} {{actions to}} the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them in <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions. The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than take {{attention away from the}} main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases it is better to include them at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement, rather than during.|$|E
25|$|One {{afternoon}} in June, Bucey was returning from Tête Jaune Cache {{and had just}} passed the Grand Canyon when he spotted a white flag on the river bank.

The passengers turned out to be twenty burly railworkers with their paychecks in <b>their</b> <b>pockets,</b> all of whom {{were on their way to}} Fort George. In particular, South Fort George, where there was a licensed hotel, and a variety of other entertainments, where one could celebrate the end of another work week. However, when the purser approached the first of these men for his fare, the man obstinately refused to pay, even after the purser offered to cash his company paycheck. Fearing that if he let one get away without paying that none would pay, the purser went up to the pilot house and spoke to Captain Bucey.|$|E

500|$|... bout {{five minutes}} later, a most {{incredible}} scene took place. Into the hall sauntered {{about a dozen}} policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They {{did not seem to}} be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.I could hardly believe my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands in <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1789 and 1790 {{there had}} been a spate of highway and house robberies. Gangs of armed men had entered houses {{in the middle of the}} night and taken away all they could carry. Armed patrols were placed around the {{neighbourhood}} to little effect until, at last, a man named James Macnamara was arrested with three others for burglary at the Dog and Partridge Inn on Stretford Road. Macnamara was tried at Lancaster Assizes and sentenced to be hanged on Kersal Moor as a warning to other criminals. A large number of people came to watch the execution but, as Joseph Aston said in his Metrical Records of Manchester [...] "no one could suppose that the example had any use... as several persons had <b>their</b> <b>pockets</b> picked within sight of the gallows and the following night a house was broken into and robbed in Manchester".|$|E

500|$|The film is {{primarily}} presented {{from the perspective}} of the character Dax and his camera, but Nourizadeh also obtained footage by providing the cast and extras with recording devices such as BlackBerrys and iPhones to capture events occurring outside of the perspective or knowledge of the cameraman. This resulted in hours of unusable footage that had to be observed by Nourizadeh and his team to find segments that could be incorporated into the final film. Nourizadeh stated [...] "when you have real material being shot by real people, it then kind of feels like it is. It is found footage. I hated spending 10 hours looking through bits of flip footage – people didn’t press stop, it's like in <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b> But yeah, it was great, man." [...] Other footage was provided from fictional police and news cameras to give a different perspective on the events.|$|E
500|$|The Stasi, East Germany's secret police, {{adopted a}} policy of concealing killings as much as possible. In {{the case of the}} November 1986 {{shooting}} of Michael Bittner at the Wall, a Stasi report commented: [...] "The political sensitivity of the state border to Berlin (West) made it necessary to conceal the incident. Rumours about the incident had to be prevented from circulating, with information passing to West Berlin or the FRG [...]" [...] The Stasi took charge of [...] "corpse cases" [...] and those injured while trying to cross the border, who were transported to hospitals run by the Stasi or the police where they would recuperate before being transferred to Stasi prisons. The Stasi also took sole responsibility for the disposal of the dead and their possessions. Bodies were not returned to relatives but were cremated, usually at the crematorium at Baumschulenweg. Occasionally the cost of the cremations was covered by the victims themselves using money taken from <b>their</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E
500|$|In Western movies, the characters' gun belts {{are often}} worn {{low on the}} hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be {{distinguished}} from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in <b>their</b> <b>pockets</b> and waistbands. Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the [...] "Gun that Won the West", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for [...] "express messengers" [...] and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who {{were in charge of}} overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.|$|E

50|$|Once {{inside a}} Mercedes-Benz vehicle, the SmartKey fob, unlike keyless entry fobs, {{is placed in}} the {{ignition}} slot where a starter computer verifies the rolling code. Verified in milliseconds, it can then be turned as a traditional key to start the engine. The device was designed with cooperation of Siemens Automotive and Huf exclusively for Mercedes-Benz, but many luxury manufacturers have implemented similar technology based on the same idea. In addition to the SmartKey, Mercedes-Benz now integrates as an option Keyless Go; this feature allows the driver to keep the SmartKey in <b>their</b> <b>pocket,</b> yet giving them the ability to open the doors, trunk as well as starting the car without ever removing it from <b>their</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R
