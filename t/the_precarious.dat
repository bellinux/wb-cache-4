5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds {{was adamant}} that Verrières Ridge {{should be taken}} and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} <b>the</b> <b>precarious</b> Allied position. Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations {{and by the time}} the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} CNSA {{during the}} war was {{considered}} extremely successful by contemporaries and modern historians alike. By providing a network of food distribution, the CNSA and CRB managed to avoid a major famine in Belgium during the occupation. Nevertheless, although the CRB and CNSA {{were part of the}} same network, the CRB criticized the CNSA, holding it responsible for occasional thefts of food by the Germans and for providing inadequate security for the shipments. The Belgian arm, however, felt under undue pressure from the CRB. In 1916, Francqui even petitioned the British to allow the CNSA to take full charge of the international network away from the CRB, although this appeal was dismissed because of <b>the</b> <b>precarious</b> position CNSA held within the occupied country. Nevertheless, relations between the two bodies remained generally good.|$|E

5|$|While Montejo was {{preparing}} his considerable expedition, he received news of <b>the</b> <b>precarious</b> {{position of the}} Spanish in Higueras. Fearing {{the collapse of the}} colony, he appointed Alonso de Cáceres as captain-general, and sent him ahead with a small detachment of soldiers, to make his way overland via Santiago de Guatemala, recruiting more soldiers en route. Cáceres was an experienced officer, who had already fought in the conquest of Yucatán. In Santiago, Cáceres recruited a further 20 cavalry, and acquired additional arms and supplies. He arrived in Gracias a Dios with his relief force in late November or early December 1536, and described the settlement as being in a deplorable state. His expedition gave temporary respite, and morale was improved with the news that Montejo would soon be in Honduras. However, there was some political resistance to Cáceres from the town council, appointed by the Alvarados, which wished to see Pedro de Alvarado continue as governor, and Honduras unified with Guatemala, and factional plotting ensued.|$|E
5|$|Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana {{was aware}} of the {{increasing}} number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan army, and made representations to President Museveni on the matter. At the same time, many native Ugandans began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions. He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989. They remained de facto senior officers, but the change caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. In 1990, a dispute in southwestern Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans, led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labelling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens. Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and <b>the</b> <b>precarious</b> Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately. It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion, but did not explicitly support it. In mid-1990, Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, United States and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army. This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda. After two days of discussion, Rwigyema successfully persuaded Museveni that he needed a break following the years fighting, and was allowed to remain in Uganda. Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead, and the RPF leadership felt that in order to avoid suspicion, they {{had no choice but to}} allow him to attend, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.|$|E
