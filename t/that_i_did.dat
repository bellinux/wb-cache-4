5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to talk about the things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I {{do the same things}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E

25|$|Now, as it happened, I had {{confined}} myself {{strictly to}} the business of clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not pretend that I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time, the fact remains <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not give a shot, nor was I armed when captured. I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E
25|$|Ladies and Gentlemen I {{accept the}} flowers as a memento of {{reconciliation}} {{between the white}} and colored races of the southern states. I accept it more particularly as {{it comes from a}} colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. (Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

500|$|Richard Feynman {{likewise}} held {{a favorable}} {{view of the}} house and of his tenure as Telluride House Faculty Fellow. In an interview he described the House as [...] "a group of boys that have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize. In a correspondence with a fellow Telluride associate congratulating him on the Nobel Prize, Feynman said, [...] "It was at Telluride <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> do all that stuff for which I got the prize, so I look back at those days with nostalgia." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2005, Lambis Nikolaou denied Gilady's claims: [...] "All this {{speculation}} surrounding my role in {{the third}} round of voting for the 2012 candidates is totally unfounded.

[...] This statement was confirmed by the IOC voting numbers, which demonstrate that, even if Nikolaou had voted for Madrid, the city would have failed to beat Paris in the third voting round.|$|E
500|$|New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman {{stated that}} the {{settlement}} and payment by Trump [...] "is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university." [...] Trump himself said he settled [...] "for {{a small fraction of}} the potential award" [...] because he was too busy as president-elect to take it to trial. He added, [...] "The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!" ...|$|E

500|$|Henry scored {{his first}} hat-trick in Europe for Arsenal against Roma on 27 November 2002 with the player stating; [...] "It's {{wonderful}} {{to score a}} hat-trick but it's even more important <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so in a game we've won." [...] The result was followed with four consecutive draws – three at home against Roma, Valencia and Ajax. Arsenal only needed a draw to progress into the knockout stages, but lost 2–1 to Valencia at the Mestalla on 19 March 2003. Reflecting later on the Champions League campaign, Wenger commented that [...] "we lost our qualification at home".|$|E
500|$|I {{told him}} to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause {{constantly}} thrown in my face. I {{did not believe that}} a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not want it. [...] "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." ...|$|E
500|$|Koval {{described}} his 57 years of post-spy life living in Russia as [...] "uneventful". His family {{knew he had}} done work for the GRU, but the subject was never discussed. He did not receive any high awards upon his return, a fact that bothered him. Bigger awards went to [...] "career men", he told Kramish. However, he ended his correspondence by {{saying that he was}} not protesting his treatment; [...] " [...] <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not find myself in a Gulag, as might well have happened".

500|$|Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald {{to stand}} for a vacant seat in Kingston, Ontario. It was a {{traditional}} Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it. [...] "I told Mr. King <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people", Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald {{had no choice but}} {{to stand for}} office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E
