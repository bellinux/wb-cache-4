25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> for off-road use. Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 <b>transfer</b> <b>box.</b> The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E

25|$|The EQ2050 {{is based}} on an {{imported}} AM General Hummer H1 chassis. The DFM EQ2050 is powered by a Dongfeng license-built Cummins EQB150-20 110kW/2,700R turbo-charged diesel, {{but it can also be}} fitted with the U.S.-made V8 diesel originally designed for Humvee. Both vehicles have a 5-speed gear box and a 2-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>box.</b> They are both four-wheel drive with independent suspensions and central inflating system. The EQ2050 also has re-designed lights and radiator to make it look differehaint from the original Humvee. DFM has cooperated with AM General Motors on getting American-made parts for the first EQ2050s made.|$|E

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 <b>transfer</b> <b>box</b> gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E
2500|$|Originally the Land Rover was {{a single}} model offering, which from 1948 until 1951 used an [...] {{wheelbase}} and a 1.6-litre petrol engine producing around [...] The four-speed gearbox from the Rover P3 was used, with a new two-speed <b>transfer</b> <b>box.</b> This incorporated an unusual four-wheel-drive system, with a freewheel unit (as used on several Rover cars of the time). This disengaged the front axle from the manual transmission on the overrun, allowing a form of permanent 4WD. A ring-pull mechanism in the driver's footwell allowed the freewheel to be locked to provide more traditional 4WD. This was a basic vehicle: tops for the doors and a roof (canvas or metal) were optional extras. In 1950, the lights moved from a position behind the grille to protruding through the grille.|$|E
50|$|Making Tracks is the {{cooperative}} program between the NWTF and state, federal and provincial wildlife agencies to restore wild turkeys to all suitable habitat in North America. The NWTF works with wildlife agencies coordinating the trap and transfer of wild turkeys. Wild turkey populations {{have more than}} doubled since 1990. In areas where they are abundant, wild turkeys are trapped via nets propelled or dropped over a feeding flock. Trapped birds are individually placed in specialized transport boxes, and then released in areas of suitable habitat with few or no wild turkeys. The NWTF routinely provides trapping equipment, <b>transfer</b> <b>boxes</b> and helps coordinate wild turkey transfers between states, provinces and nations. Since the 1950s, state and provincial wildlife agencies have moved more than 192,000 wild turkeys into suitable habitat across North America. The NWTF, founded in 1973, helped accelerate those efforts by providing trapping equipment, <b>transfer</b> <b>boxes,</b> funding and volunteers. Currently, there are more than 7 million wild turkeys throughout North America.|$|R

5000|$|This second-generation Type 2 {{lost its}} {{distinctive}} split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are Breadloaf and Bay-window, or Loaf and Bay for short. At 1.6 L and [...] DIN, {{the engine was}} also slightly larger. The battery and electrical system was upgraded to 12 volts, making it incompatible with electric accessories from the previous generation. The new model also did away with the swing axle rear suspension and <b>transfer</b> <b>boxes</b> previously used to raise ride height. Instead, half-shaft axles fitted with constant velocity joints raised ride height without the wild changes in camber of the Beetle-based swing axle suspension. The updated Bus transaxle is usually sought after by off-road racers using air-cooled Volkswagen components.|$|R
5000|$|An Eland's gearbox has one reverse and six forward gears. It is crosswise, {{coupled to}} {{both sides of the}} bevel pinion. Drive is {{transmitted}} from the gearbox to two lateral <b>transfer</b> <b>boxes</b> via pinions to the rear wheels and drive shafts that follow the hull to the front wheels. The shafts have extra universal joints beneath the turret. Each shaft drives a second cam type differential which bar either of the two wheel pairs from exerting a speed radically different from the other. In this respect Elands are less likely to experience transmission fouls and tyre wear than other armoured cars with a single central differential. The Panhard electric clutch, a major stumbling block for inexperienced drivers, [...] {{has been replaced by a}} more concurrent hydraulic system for easier maintenance and reduced crew training time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Central {{differential}} is a {{geared mechanism}} located {{between the two}} driving axles thereby providing torque developed by engine in required ratio to both the axle. In ordinary four wheel drive vehicle, there are two differentials one in rear axle and other in front axle along with a <b>transfer</b> gear <b>box</b> in between, which converts it to four wheel drive. A four wheel drive vehicle without a central differential cannot be driven on dry, paved roads in four-wheel drive mode, as small differences in rotational speed between {{the front and rear}} wheels produces extra torque to be applied across the transmission. This phenomenon is known as "wind-up", and can cause considerable damage to the transmission or drive train. But in all wheel drive vehicle <b>transfer</b> gear <b>box</b> is replaced by central differential that transmit the power for all whee...|$|R
