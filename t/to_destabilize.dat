5|$|On 15–16 January 1974, Suharto faced a {{significant}} challenge when violent riots {{broke out in}} Jakarta during visit of Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors was encouraged by General Sumitro, deputy commander of armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. It was reported to Suharto that the riots were engineered by Sumitro who wished <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> the regime utilizing the student unrest, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred as Malari Incident (Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari / Disaster of 15 January). However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who claimed they had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being paid {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival and neighbor. Russian efforts <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E
50|$|Although Awan was defeated, the Elamites {{were able}} to avoid total assimilation. The capital of Anshan, located in a steep and mountainous area, was never reached by Akkad. The Elamites {{remained}} {{a major source of}} tension, that would contribute <b>to</b> <b>destabilizing</b> the Akkadian state, until it finally collapsed under Gutian pressure.|$|R

5|$|Worn {{down by the}} {{communist}} guerrilla war for Vietnamese independence and handed a watershed defeat by communist Viet Minh rebels at the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu, the French accepted a negotiated abandonment of their colonial stake in Vietnam. In the Geneva Conference, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower's United States sent economic aid and military advisers to strengthen South Vietnam's pro-Western regime against communist efforts <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> it.|$|E
5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{security}} agents {{was cut by}} 22% and, by a widespread amnesty, 35,000 detainees across the entire country were released. 9,000 imprisoned for political reasons were freed in all. Hardline Stalinists, such as Jakub Berman, Roman Romkowski and Anatol Fejgin, were removed from power, some arrested. Berman, dismissed in May, by Gomułka's decision was never prosecuted. Under Gomułka, a few perpetrators of Stalinist crimes were prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms. A much broader plan to charge the responsible and verify all of the security apparatus was formally presented by the prosecutors, but the action was not approved by Gomułka, who counted among the Stalinist persecution victims, as did his wife. Gomułka conducted some purges and reforms but did not want <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> the security system, now under his control, by wide-ranging formal prosecutions.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} weather was issued for northern Kansas into southern Nebraska and from eastern West Virginia through Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. An ongoing line of thunderstorms moved east across West Virginia as the atmosphere began <b>to</b> <b>destabilize.</b> The thunderstorms {{resulted in a}} threat for isolated tornadoes in eastern sections of West Virginia, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland. In the central Great Plains region, a warm front extended northeast in northeastern Kansas from a surface low in central sections of Kansas. Strong instability occurred {{in the vicinity of}} the area as a result of surface heating. An intensifying low-level jet stream broke the cap in the region and resulted in the development of thunderstorms. During the afternoon, numerous thunderstorms formed across the Mid-Atlantic States. An EF0tornado was produced from one of the thunderstorms that impacted portions of Chesapeake Beach, tearing off sections of roof and siding from 10to 20single family homes. EF1tornadoes were produced in Culpeper, Clarke and Stafford counties in Virginia. Several other EF0 and EF1 tornadoes formed throughout the Great Plains region.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the German {{government}} hoped <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> British {{rule over}} India by spreading {{rumors that the}} British were unable to redeem for silver all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of silver, caused the price of silver to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase silver to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 silver dollars at $1 per ounce of silver plus {{the value of the}} copper in the coins, and handling and transportation fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new silver dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from silver purchased from American mining companies.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008, US forces began {{accelerating}} their {{move out}} of cities across Iraq, turning over the task of maintaining security to Iraqi forces. The Marines pulled out of both Fallujah and Haditha Dam in November and December. Lance Corporal Brandon Lara from 3rd Battalion 4th Marines was the last American service member killed in Anbar, on 19 July 2009. In early August, a unit of Marines operating in Anbar located and recovered the body of Navy Captain Scott Speicher, who had been missing in action since the 1991 Gulf War. By 6 October 2009, the last two Marine Regiments had left, ending the American combat presence. Experts and many Iraqis were worried that AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> the country. There was a spike {{in the number of}} suicide attacks, and AQI rebounded in strength through November 2009 and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the government.|$|E

5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E
5|$|Upon investigation, {{the crew}} find that Worf's RNA has an unusual quantum {{signature}} and confirm {{that he is}} from a different universe. The crew theorizes that Worf, on his original return from the bat'leth tournament, passed through a time-space fissure, with the shuttlecraft's engines causing Worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes. Data determines that Worf's proximity to La Forge's VISOR caused Worf to shift between universes, and that each universe covers a different possibility. In effect, anything that could possibly happen has done so in a parallel universe, hence the believable changes in the reality that Worf is experiencing. The Enterprise returns {{to the location of}} the fissure, attempting to return Worf to his original universe. The Enterprise is then attacked by a Bajoran ship, which causes the fissure <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> and the various realities to merge, resulting in over 285,000 versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same area of space.|$|E
5|$|Just {{days before}} his death, Walker had tried to bolster the defences of the central and eastern {{sections}} of the 38th parallel by stretching the South Korean forces from Chuncheon to the Korean east coast. Following his instructions, the ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while the ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, the ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division {{in the aftermath of}} the Ch'ongch'on River battle, filled the gap between the ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of the US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength South Korean units. Because the South Korean forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950, most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training, and out of the four South Korean divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy. Taking advantage of the situation, the North Korean forces had been probing the South Korean lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts. On December 27, 1950, the KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on the ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened <b>to</b> <b>destabilize</b> the entire UN eastern front.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{religion}} in individuals' bereavement processes has been studied both empirically and qualitatively and has shown that religion can be a resource in coping with aversive events. Despite this evidence, few research studies have focused on the effects of religious denomination on bereavement and bereavement processes. This study contributes to this under-examined field by shedding light on the bereavement processes of six Quakers and the role that their Quaker faith played in their responses to and understanding of familial loss. Analysis of interviews with these individuals suggests a distinct Quaker response <b>to</b> the <b>destabilizing</b> experience of death, one that involves an acknowledgment and acceptance of uncertainty. This response differs from three commonly identified reactions <b>to</b> <b>destabilizing</b> experiences described as reassessment, revision and rejection of individual's previous cognitive schemas. From this study, it would appear that Quakers' religious cognitive schemas are able <b>to</b> withstand the <b>destabilizing</b> event of death and thus that in the bereavement processes of individual Friends, death affirms their acceptance and knowledge of an uncertain world...|$|R

50|$|CpG island {{methylation}} {{is important}} in regulation of gene expression, yet cytosine methylation can lead directly <b>to</b> <b>destabilizing</b> genetic mutations and a precancerous cellular state. Methylated cytosines make hydrolysis of the amine group and spontaneous conversion to thymine more favorable. They can cause aberrant recruitment of chromatin proteins. Cytosine methylations change the amount of UV light absorption of the nucleotide base, creating pyrimidine dimers. When mutation results in loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor gene sites, these genes may become inactive. Single base pair mutations during replication can also have detrimental effects.|$|R
