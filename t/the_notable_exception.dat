5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were four}} of the {{thirteen}} colonies in British America, located between the New England Colonies and the Southern Colonies. Along with the Chesapeake Colonies, this area now roughly makes up the Mid-Atlantic states (though with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of Vermont, which is reckoned with New England).|$|E
5|$|Much of South Dakota, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of the Black Hills, is {{dominated}} by a temperate grasslands biome. Although grasses and crops cover most of this region, deciduous trees such as cottonwoods, elms, and willows are common near rivers and in shelter belts. In open, uncultivated areas of the plains, grasses such as buffalograss, western wheatgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem and little bluestem thrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} among Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of Jaunutis, who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis. These two brothers {{went on to}} provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland.|$|E
50|$|Most Liberamente members (with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Frattini and Sacconi) {{joined the}} new Forza Italia in November 2013.|$|R
50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> listed below, <b>the</b> Colorado Senate {{operates}} {{in a manner}} quite similar to the United States Senate.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy is}} mostly agrarian with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of a winery, brewery, {{and a gold}} mine in the nearby village of Kazreti.|$|R
5|$|In the east, the Roman–Persian Wars {{continued}} until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau {{agreed on a}} 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of the Balkans, which were subjected to repeated incursions from the Slavs and the Gepids. Tribes of Serbs and Croats were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, {{during the reign of}} Heraclius. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and defeated the new Hunnish threat. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and they agreed to a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Silverthrone {{is part of}} the Pemberton Volcanic Belt, {{which is}} {{circumscribed}} by a group of epizonal intrusions. At another deeply eroded caldera complex called Franklin Glacier Volcano, the Pemberton Volcanic Belt merges with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a northwest-trending belt of volcanic cones and fields extending from near the Canada–United States border east of Vancouver on the British Columbia Coast. The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate. With <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of King Island, all the intrusive and eruptive rocks are calc-alkaline, mainly granodioritic bodies and dacite ejecta.|$|E
5|$|The republic's {{administrative}} divisions {{remained largely}} unchanged from the structure {{used during the}} Soviet era, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of selsoviets—a low-level administrative unit type abolished after the new law on the administrative-territorial divisions had been adopted in May 2000. As of 2014, the republic's administrative-territorial divisions include seven administrative districts (raions) and two republican urban okrugs. The districts have administrative jurisdiction over the inhabited localities located on their territory. Territories of the republican urban okrugs are separate from the districts and include a city/town of the republican significance, {{as well as one}} or several inhabited localities in their vicinity which had historically been administratively subordinated to that city/town.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an applied welfare {{analysis}} {{in the tradition of}} Harberger that confronts <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> to <b>the</b> appropriate use of a single market measure for general equilibrium welfare analysis. We bring together the results of several elaborative studies on Harberger's 1971 essay and present some empirical remedies that address <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> to <b>the</b> appropriate use of estimates made in a single market. A case study involving a U. S. antidumping suit against Canadian exports of potash is presented. Copyright 1996, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the members}} of the Long Parliament {{realised}} that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the Eastern Association), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The Self-denying Ordinance, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of Oliver Cromwell, forbade members of parliament from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation {{for the creation of a}} Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General Thomas Fairfax, which became known as the New Model Army (originally new-modelled Army).|$|E
5|$|The entire {{district}} is densely developed, primarily residential in its {{northern and southern}} portions, with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant open spaces within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main quad at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but {{with a mix of}} office and residential space on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential townhouses. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> to {{this was}} when land was claimed by the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land claimed by Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley, {{in an area that}} is now Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The area was also claimed by Pennsylvania, which refused to {{recognize}} the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor Clinton of New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E
50|$|The city is ostensibly {{ruled by}} an Overlord and a nobility. The Thieves' Guild is influential, too, and {{controls}} Lankhmar's abundant criminal element, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.|$|R

5|$|The trial, {{which was}} held from 22 July to 4 October 1948, was marked by {{numerous}} irregularities. The principal {{witness for the prosecution}} was shot dead three days before the trial, and much of the evidence against the defendants was obtained through torture. All three were found guilty of conspiracy against the state and endangering national security. Although these points were raised at the trial, Ravoahangy was sentenced to death, along with Raseta and four other nationalists, while Rabemananjara was sentenced to life in prison. In July 1949, the convicts' death sentences were commuted to life in prison, and the trio remained imprisoned until they were granted amnesty in 1958. Few individuals, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of Monja Jaona, the founder of Jiny in the south, have claimed responsibility for a leadership role in the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E
5|$|However, Russell also {{received}} negative attention. Constantly provoked by New York Knicks center Ray Felix during a game, he complained to coach Auerbach. The latter {{told him to}} take matters into his own hands, so after the next provocation, Russell punched Felix unconscious, paid a $25 fine and was no longer a target of cheap fouls. With his teammates, Russell had a cordial relationship, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of fellow rookie and old rival Heinsohn. Heinsohn felt that Russell resented him because the former was named the 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year: many people thought that Russell was more important, but Russell also had only played half the season. Russell also ignored Heinsohn's plea to give his cousin an autograph, and openly said to Heinsohn that he deserved half of his $300 Rookie of the Year check. The relationship between the two rookies remained reserved. On the other hand, despite their different ethnic backgrounds and lack of common off-court interests, his relationship with Celtics point guard and fan favorite Bob Cousy was amicable.|$|E
30|$|Country-level {{unemployment}} rates are in general generally more strongly {{correlated with the}} EU aggregate than {{in the case of}} employment growth. The same is true for activity rates, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Denmark, Finland and Sweden.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after her}} commissioning, Littorio was badly damaged during the British air raid on Taranto on 11 November 1940, which put {{her out of}} action until the {{following}} March. Littorio thereafter took part in several sorties to catch the British Mediterranean Fleet, most of which failed to result in any action, <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> being the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, where she damaged several British warships. Littorio was renamed Italia in July 1943 {{after the fall of}} the Fascist government. On 9 September 1943, the Italian fleet was attacked by German bombers while it was on its way to internment. During this action, which saw the destruction of her sister , Italia herself was hit by a Fritz X radio-controlled bomb, causing significant damage to her bow. As part of the armistice agreement, Italia was interned at Malta, Alexandria, and finally in the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal, where she remained until 1947. Italia was awarded to the United States as a war prize and scrapped at La Spezia in 195254.|$|E
5|$|After {{both the}} British Industrial Syndicalist Education League (ISEL), a {{short-lived}} syndicalist organization {{heavily involved in}} the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG {{was the first to}} express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide— the CGT— refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions. Despite these challenges, the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both labor unions and political groups— had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by Karl Roche, Carl Windhoff, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside Jack Wills. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with Jack Tanner. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably Alceste De Ambris of the Italian USI, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided {{on the question of whether}} its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau. The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. The congress was considered a success by most who attended, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the congress did not take place. The Bulletin only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to cease publication.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the primary}} source of {{electrical}} energy is hydroelectric, nuclear, or wind, transferring electricity via the grid can be convenient, since the resource may be too distant for direct heating applications (with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of solar thermal energy).|$|E
30|$|The {{share of}} women in the {{employed}} population varies between 46 and 49 % in almost all countries, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Italy and Japan where the share {{of women in}} employed population is relatively small—around 40 %.|$|R
25|$|The {{changes were}} {{adopted by the}} Royal Mail for the {{purposes}} of postal addresses wherever they were able, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Hereford and Worcester and Greater Manchester.

50|$|In {{an era of}} over-dramatised {{acting in}} Tamil films, Sigappu Rojakkal was one of <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions.</b> <b>The</b> film {{completed}} a 175-day run at the box office. It won two Filmfare Awards in the Best Actor and Best Director categories.|$|R
25|$|In the {{following}} fifty years the Soviet policies towards the Ukrainian language mostly varied between quiet discouragement and suppression to persecution and cultural purges, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> for {{the decade of}} Shelest's leadership in the Soviet Ukraine (1963–1972).|$|E
25|$|European {{countries}} – with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of the United Kingdom, where {{distances and}} lengths are indicated in miles, yards, feet, and inches, and speed limits {{are expressed in}} miles per hour – use the metric system on road signs.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentrations}} of other trace elements vary as well {{according to the}} kind of coal combusted to form it. In fact, in the case of bituminous coal, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exception</b> of boron, trace element concentrations are generally similar to trace element concentrations in unpolluted soils.|$|E
50|$|The Conservatives six {{gains were}} largely a regaining of Labour's 1963 gains, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Beeston, which they already held, and Kirkstall - {{a first for}} the ward, which had been {{monolithically}} Labour since the boundary changes in 1951.|$|R
50|$|For {{more than}} a century localities changed little. The major {{modifications}} were from the colonization of new territories. Until 2002 and 2006, there were no major reorganizations in the municipal history of Quebec, with <b>the</b> <b>notable</b> <b>exceptions</b> of Laval, Mirabel and Bécancour.|$|R
50|$|In {{the area}} {{surrounding}} Peachtree Street, {{very little of}} the original architecture was preserved.
