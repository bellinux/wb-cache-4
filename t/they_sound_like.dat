500|$|For Elvis Costello, The Basement Tapes [...] "sound {{like they}} were made in a {{cardboard}} box. I think [...] was trying to write songs that sounded like he'd just found them under a stone. As if <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> real folk songs—because {{if you go back}} into the folk tradition, you will find songs as dark and as deep as these." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's wide {{international}} success, Parlophone's president Miles Leonard {{has stated}} that one of Coldplay's [...] "secrets" [...] {{is that they have}} never sounded like a parochial UK artist, saying: [...] "Some bands are very proud to be British, but sometimes come across as being very ‘British’. Coldplay never aspire to that; on one hand they sound British but on the other <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a huge global artist." [...] In 2011 Coldplay were hailed as 'rock statesmen'.|$|E
500|$|Adam Farber of Sony Music Entertainment explained: [...] "The vinyl box {{is a real}} {{treat for}} fans, {{especially}} with today's renewed and increased interest in vinyl." [...] It {{is the first time}} that ten of Slayer's studio albums have been mass-produced on vinyl. Dino Paredes of American Recordings relates: [...] "It's been years and years since the Slayer vinyl has been in print — only the two most recent albums are currently available on vinyl, the rest have been out of print for years and very hard to find. These albums sound spectacular — <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> you've never heard them before. Everything about 'The Vinyl Conflict' — the look of it, the feel of it — is very strong, very powerful, very Slayer, from the music to the dripping, bloody pentagram on the front of the box. It's perfect." ...|$|E
60|$|Shots awoke me, I think, distant shots. And <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the ripping {{and tearing}} of cloth for a wound. 'Twas no new sound to me.|$|R
50|$|Grant Morrison, {{the writer}} of JLA, {{deliberately}} designed {{the members of the}} Hyperclan to be as 'kiddy' as possible; Metamorpho even commented that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the names of children's toys.|$|R
25|$|The name arose {{when his}} brother , with voice still unbroken, made queer-sounding appeals for l.b.w. The humorist, Springbok Atholl McKinnon, said <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a dog barking, {{and called him}} Pooch. When Graeme joined the provincial eleven they became Big Dog and Little Dog.|$|R
500|$|NME called Animals [...] "one of {{the most}} extreme, relentless, {{harrowing}} and downright iconoclastic hunks of music {{to have been made}} available this side of the sun", and Melody Maker Karl Dallas described it as an [...] "uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific". [...] Rolling Stone Frank Rose was unimpressed, writing: [...] "The 1977 Floyd has turned bitter and morose. [...] They complain about the duplicity of human behavior (and then title their songs after animals – get it?). [...] <b>They</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they've just discovered this – their message has become pointless and tedious." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] rating and found the negative reaction overly cynical, reasoning that the album functions simply as [...] "a piece of well-constructed political program music... lyrical, ugly, and rousing, all in the right places".|$|E
500|$|Reception to Revelation was positive, {{with some}} critics {{regarding}} the album {{as one of}} Third Day's best albums to date. Andree Farias of Allmusic gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and commented that [...] "Revelation finds Third Day trying new things, but not to the extent that <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a different band". He felt that the change of environment [...] "intimidated [...] for the better", making them not settle for [...] "middle of the road" [...] songs. He described the album's sound as [...] "muscular" [...] and [...] "anthemic... unquestionably populist, yet the closest Third Day has come to replicating the Southern-fried goodness of Time". He regarded Revelation as [...] "the best album Third Day has released this decade" [...] and considered the album a return to the [...] "unbridled fervor" [...] Third Day was characterized by early in their career.|$|E
500|$|Released {{in early}} 1975, Blood on the Tracks {{received}} mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described [...] "the accompaniments [...] often so trashy <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> mere practice takes." [...] In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that [...] "the record {{has been made}} with typical shoddiness." [...] Over the years critics came {{to see it as}} one of Dylan's greatest achievements. In Salon.com, Bill Wyman wrote: [...] "Blood on the Tracks is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years." [...] Novelist Rick Moody called it [...] "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to vocalist/guitarist Mike Vennart: [...] "at the {{beginning}} of 'Ornament/The Last Wrongs' {{there are all these}} weird ambient noises and what it was is that a friend of ours was in the Amazon jungle and recorded all these parrots. <b>They</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> kids laughing and shouting, not parrots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When men do {{not feel}} towards the humblest {{stranger}} {{as if he were}} a brother," [...] said the traveler, in tones so deep that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> those of an organ, [...] "they are unworthy to exist on earth, which was created as the abode of a great human brotherhood!" ...|$|R
50|$|Bill Mitchell {{returned}} to re-word the deep gravelly voice drop-ins and simply said 604 instead of 194.Many presenters were chosen because <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> presenters {{that were already}} on Capital 194. Finally the Capital 194 logo was slightly modified by changing 194's swallow to a seagull (as a symbol of freedom) and obviously changing the number to 604.|$|R
500|$|The song {{featured}} in Mojos 1997 list [...] "Psychedelia: The 100 Greatest Classics", where Jon Savage {{described it as}} an [...] "aural pleasure" [...] that included [...] "mad brass and handclaps so luscious that <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the chewing of a thousand cows". In July 2001, Uncut placed the song at number 43 on its list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Beatles Tracks". Five year later, Mojo ranked it 85th on the magazine's list of [...] "The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs" [...] (between [...] "You Won't See Me" [...] and [...] "Lovely Rita"). The editors credited [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] with inspiring the Krautrock genre, while Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie described it as [...] "a great piece of music" [...] that, in departing from the Beatles' more regimented approach, evokes [...] "the same feeling you get in 'Be-Bop-A-Lula' or a Muddy Waters or John Lee Hooker tune". Writing for the website Ultimate Classic Rock, Dave Swanson considers [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] to be [...] "one of the band's most captivating works from the psychedelic era, {{and one of the}} Beatles' great lost songs".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the album, drummer Crahan touted To My Surprise as [...] "a hybrid of folk, '70s rock fuzz and {{schizophrenic}} grooves". Neil Strauss of The New York Times stated that each song has a unique sound, concluding that <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "pop songs that have been pushed off balance". In another article Strauss includes They Might Be Giants, Weezer and Faith No More as bands with similar-sounding [...] "elements". Rowan Shaeffer of Counterculture, commented on the album's diversity, saying [...] "to say that the [...] is eclectic would be a gross understatement," [...] citing Pink Floyd and Mr. Bungle as evident influences. The Calgary Suns Mike Bell cited [...] "glam, new wave, Beatles pop and country rock" [...] as the sounds the album presents. In his review for Allmusic RobertL.Doerschuk noted that the track [...] "Sunday" [...] makes musical references to the single [...] "Pleasant Valley Sunday" [...] by The Monkees, giving the [...] "happy, strumming guitars and skippy rhythms" [...] as similarities. He also said that they quote [...] "one of the darker verses in the Jim Morrison songbook".|$|E
500|$|... "If I Needed Someone" [...] was {{the first}} Harrison {{composition}} to become a chart hit, {{as a result of}} the Hollies' cover. Their version peaked at number 20 in Britain, but by their standards at the time, it was one of their least successful singles. Many listeners perceived the song as the Hollies attempting to align themselves with the Beatles. In one of his articles covering the Beatles' concurrent UK tour, Alan Smith of the NME quoted Harrison as saying that the Hollies' version was [...] "rubbish" [...] and that [...] "the way they do their records, <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> session men who've just got together in a studio without ever seeing each other before. Technically good, yes. But that's all." [...] Lennon also criticised their treatment of the song, having long disliked the Hollies' sound. These comments incensed Nash, who responded by saying that he was tired of Lennon's continual insults and would [...] "back any of us boys against the Beatles musically any time". In January 1966, at a press conference following his and Boyd's wedding, Harrison laughed off a reporter's question as to whether he had invited the Hollies to the ceremony, adding that the issue had [...] "just got out of hand".|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{finished}} in late 1998 and released in March 1999. The band's next album, Lightbulb Sun, was recorded so closely after the Stupid Dream sessions that Wilson later reflected that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> [...] "two {{parts of a}} double record". Songs from these sessions that were ultimately left off both albums were later compiled onto the b-side album Recordings in 2001.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment he}} had said the words {{he wished he could}} recall them. Their {{substance}} was right enough; it was the sound of them that was wrong. <b>They</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a line from a farce, where the erring husband has been caught by the masterful wife. They were ridiculous. Worse than being merely ridiculous, they created an atmosphere of guilt and evasion.|$|R
60|$|The raven, in {{his little}} basket at his master's back, hearing this {{frequent}} mention of his name {{in a tone of}} exultation, expressed his sympathy by crowing like a cock, and afterwards running over his various phrases of speech with such rapidity, and in so many varieties of hoarseness, that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the murmurs of a crowd of people.|$|R
500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. The Sunday Mirrors Ian Hyland rated the song {{nine out of}} ten stars and described it as [...] "ure class from the ever-smiling teens". According to AllMusic's Dean Carlson, [...] "Soul Sound" [...] is a representation that [...] "the jitters of youth are [...] though tempered by shrewd ambition and a clever and unpredictable production aesthetic". John Mulvey of NME stated that while the song lacked the quality of the trio's debut single [...] "Overload", it [...] "is pretty good nevertheless". He elaborated, [...] "the best thing about Sugababes is how <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> they really can't be arsed with anything, let alone any of this pop star business [...] Enough with the dance routines and shit-eating grins – does this mean total lack of enthusiasm's the way forward for teen pop?" [...] Stylus Magazine writer Scott Plagenhoef described the single as [...] "marvelous lilting [...] hopeful", while Stephen Robinson from Hot Press was less favourable and criticised the song's pop-rock experimentation, which according to him [...] "doesn't work quite so well". Neil Western of the South China Morning Post felt that [...] "Soul Sound", along with the album's title track, [...] "lack sparkle".|$|E
500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> bubble wrap popping." [...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Ken Barnes, {{describing}} the musical style of Radio City, opens by noting {{as a backdrop}} that the band's debut, #1Record, established it as [...] "one of the leading new American bands working in the mid-Sixties pop and rock vein". Radio City, Barnes finds, has [...] "plenty of shimmering pop delights", although [...] "the opening tune, 'O My Soul,' is a foreboding, sprawling funk affair"; Barnes concludes that [...] "Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> the Byrds, sometimes like the early Who, but usually like their own indescribable selves". Radio City was released in February 1974 and, like #1Record, received excellent reviews. Record World reported, [...] "The sound is stimulating, the musicianship superb, {{and the result is}} tight and rollickingly rhythmic." [...] Billboard judged it [...] "a highly commercial set". Rolling Stones Bud Scoppa, then with Phonograph Record, affirmed, [...] "Alex Chilton has now emerged as a major talent, and he'll be heard from again". Cashbox called it [...] "a collection of excellent material that hopefully will break this deserving band in a big way". But just as #1Record had fallen victim to poor marketing, so too did Radio City. Columbia, now in complete control of the Stax catalog, refused to process it following a disagreement. Without a distributor, sales of Radio City, though far greater than those of #1Record, were minimal at only around 20,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|Boozer came up {{with this}} sciurine {{language}} by speculating what sapients without vocal cords would <b>sound</b> <b>like,</b> and decided <b>they</b> would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> chipmunks then explored whether one could make a language composed entirely of unvoiced sounds.|$|R
60|$|What {{the words}} were Joe could not understand, but to him <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> French. He smiled at the absurdity of imagining he had heard a savage speak a foreign language. At any rate, {{whatever}} had been said was trenchant with meaning. The Indians changed from gay to grave; they picked up their weapons and looked keenly on every side; the big Indian at once retied Joe, and then all crowded round the chief.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{bought my}} first Damned album because I thought <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> they'd be really evil," [...] he declares, [...] "and even now their album Machine Gun Etiquette is one I {{keep coming back}} to. I like the attitude, the free rein of it, and on an artistic level I see my music as in the {{alternative}} genre rather than dance music. Techno and electro is an alternative {{that happens to be}} on the peripheries of dance music." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cầu sung dừa Đủ xoài: In {{southern}} Vietnam, popular fruits {{used for}} offerings {{at the family}} altar in fruit arranging art are the custard-apple/sugar-apple/soursop (mãng cầu), coconut (dừa), goolar fig (sung), papaya (đu đủ), and mango (xoài), since <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "cầu sung vừa đủ xài" [...] ( [...] pray for enough [...] to use) in the southern dialect of Vietnamese.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a week of}} the Syrian intervention, Christian leaders {{issued a}} {{statement}} of support. In a 1976 diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks, a US diplomat stated [...] "if I got nothing else from my meeting with Frangie, Chamoun and Gemayel, it is their clear, unequivocal and unmistakable belief that their principal hope for saving Christian necks is Syria. <b>They</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Assad is the latest incarnation of the Crusaders." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{forget what}} the Japanese prints were which I had been sending to [...] Stevenson at his wish, but <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> {{specimens}} of Hiroshigé and [...] Kuniyoshi. The taste {{for these things}} was then quite new and had laid [...] hold on him strongly.|$|E
60|$|He {{had noticed}} the purple ice several days before, and also several mirages in the sky,--mirages {{that looked like}} hills and mountains, but which he knew were only optical delusions. Coming northward, the party had also had a splendid view of the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, that mysterious glow thought to be {{electrical}} or magnetic. Once Andy had {{said that he could}} hear the lights, and that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the low hissing of steam.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{replied the}} ferryman, [...] "but to me his voice <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a frog's croak. I {{know that in}} the Land of Oz animals can speak our language, and so can the birds and bugs and fishes; but in MY ears, <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> merely <b>like</b> growls and chirps and croaks." ...|$|R
5000|$|Louis Armstrong stated [...] "Manuel and Joe King Oliver played {{together}} in the Onward Brass Band, really something to listen to when they played for parades and funerals. They had twelve musicians in their brass band. Eddie Jackson used to really swing the tuba when the band played marches. <b>They</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a forty piece brass swing band." [...] Armstrong would follow the brass band in the second line, as he listened to those early musicians whom he idolized in his youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never lament it, as the creatur's death {{could have}} done neither of us any good, and might have done us harm.

6000|$|Then {{there are}} the good, kind somnambulists who don't prize-fight, who don't play the {{commercial}} game, who don't teach and preach somnambulism, who don't do anything except live on the dividends that are coined out of the wan, white fluid that runs in the veins of little children, out of mothers' tears, the blood of strong men, and the groans and sighs of the old. The receiver is {{as bad as the}} thief--ay, and the thief is finer than the receiver; he at least has the courage to run the risk. But the good, kind people who don't do anything won't believe this, and the assertion will make them angry--for a moment. They possess several magic phrases, which are like the incantations of a voodoo doctor driving devils away. The phrases that the good, kind people repeat to themselves and to one another sound like [...] "abstinence," [...] "temperance," [...] "thrift," [...] "virtue." [...] Sometimes they say them backward, when <b>they</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> [...] "prodigality," [...] "drunkenness," [...] "wastefulness," [...] and [...] "immorality." [...] They do not really know the meaning of these phrases, but they think they do, and that is all that is necessary for somnambulists. The calm repetition of such phrases invariably drives away the waking devils and lulls to slumber.|$|E

He looked so strange--this praefect of Rome--whose judgments everyone feared, whose strict adherence to duty the young elegants of the day were ever fond of deriding.

6000|$|With some solemn words, the purport {{of which}} I {{did not quite}} make out, except that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> swearing, the {{minister}} stood before Thomas, gave me a glance of intelligence and then with an innocent expression of face, the recollection of which to this day fills me with remorse, spilled, as if by accident, the entire contents of the bowl {{on the head of}} my poor friend--that head into the hair of which I had sifted a prodigal profusion of Seidlitz-powders! ...|$|R
2500|$|Genie {{had very}} little control of her voice during this time, so it was [...] {{completely}} monotonic, abnormally high-pitched, and very soft, with many of her early utterances completely silent and others so quiet that <b>they</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> whispers. Throughout 1971 her voice was extremely glottalized, and when she spoke she frequently pronounced only a few sounds; for instance, the word [...] "doctor" [...] <b>sounded</b> more <b>like</b> [...] "dert". Despite knowing how to ask questions, she could only indicate them through facial expressions. Despite the lack of variability in her own voice, she clearly understood different tones of voice in other peoples' speech.|$|R
