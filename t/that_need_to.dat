5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E

Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E

The game was announced and released in Japan on January 6, 2016, and in other terrorities on June 30, 2016. A third game, titled Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, was released 2017. The game adds new kinds of boxes, such as explosive bombs and rocket propelled boxes, as well as box children <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be escorted safely through levels. A physical compilation of all three games, titled , was also released in Japan the same day. The compilation also included a soundtrack CD featuring the music from all three games, {{as well as a}} Qbby Amiibo figure, the latter of which can be used with Goodbye! BoxBoy!.|$|E

5|$|The United States Clean Air Act, {{passed in}} 1990, put mercury {{on a list}} of toxic {{pollutants}} <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on 8 February 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998. However newer data published in 2015 showed that after introduction of the stricter controls mercury declined sharply, indicating that the Clean Air Act had its intended impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be nourished by the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E
