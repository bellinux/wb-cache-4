5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E
