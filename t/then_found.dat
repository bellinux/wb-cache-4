5|$|During the gunfight Norgrove's captors {{dragged her}} outside the {{building}} where she was being held, but she apparently broke away from them. Video footage of the raid showed an explosion in her vicinity; Norgrove was <b>then</b> <b>found,</b> injured, in a fetal position in a gully.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The Cameroonian <b>then</b> <b>found</b> Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E
5|$|For all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was {{by nature}} neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching {{inadvertently}} led to attacks on Jews; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer, with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially {{to the rescue}} of the Holy Land. Bernard, the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany {{to deal with the problem}} and quiet the mobs. Bernard <b>then</b> <b>found</b> Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.|$|E

5|$|Hügel-Marshall {{continued}} {{to study and}} achieved a license in child education and welfare. She <b>then</b> <b>found</b> work in a children's home in Frankfurt am Main, where she worked for twelve years. The home {{reminded her of the}} degrading orphanage she had been sent to and seemed more like a detention center than a school. Working with the other teachers, and over the opposition of the school's management, she was able to make substantial changes and to modernize it during her time there. While working there, she completed a degree in social work and pedagogy.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley <b>then</b> <b>found</b> new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes <b>then</b> <b>found</b> Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E

Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody picked him up, he slept in a ditch. He <b>then</b> <b>found</b> a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver then drove Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.|$|E
5|$|Romney soon {{switched}} Bain Capital's {{focus from}} startups {{to the relatively}} new business of leveraged buyouts: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, then taking steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years. Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but <b>then</b> <b>found</b> deals that made large returns. The firm invested in or acquired Accuride Corporation, Brookstone, Domino's Pizza, Sealy Corporation, Sports Authority, and Artisan Entertainment, {{as well as some}} lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors. Much of the firm's profit was earned from {{a relatively small number of}} deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.|$|E
5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion <b>then</b> <b>found</b> {{at the apex of}} Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{scheduled date}} {{of entry into}} service for the MRA4 was April 2003; however, development proved far more protracted than anticipated. Early on, an independent company, Flight Refuelling Ltd., had been contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford <b>then</b> <b>found</b> that the new wing was flawed, {{which resulted in the}} project being put on hold while another wing design was developed.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} many Yiddish theatres, {{particularly}} around Whitechapel. These developed into professional companies, after {{the arrival of}} Jacob Adler in 1884 {{and the formation of}} his 'Russian Jewish Operatic Company' that first performed in Beaumont Hall, Stepney, and <b>then</b> <b>found</b> homes both in the Prescott Street Club, Stepney, and in Princelet Street in Spitalfields. The Pavilion became an exclusively Yiddish theatre in 1906, finally closing in 1936 and being demolished in 1960. Other important Jewish theatres were Feinmans, The Jewish National Theatre and the Grand Palais. Performances were in Yiddish, and predominantly melodrama. These declined, as audience and actors left for New York and the more prosperous parts of London.|$|E
5|$|While the WRO {{continues}} {{to fight the}} remnants of Deepground, Vincent transforms into Chaos {{in a desperate attempt}} to defeat Omega Weiss. Shelke dives inside Omega to find Lucrecia's Protomateria, and upon finding it, she gives it to Vincent, also telling him that his survival made Lucrecia happy. Vincent then takes control of Chaos and battles Omega. Omega sprouts wings and tries to ascend from the planet, but Vincent manages to destroy it, disappearing in the process. A week later, he is seen visiting Lucrecia's crystalline tomb in the Crystal Cave. He states that both Chaos and Omega have returned to the Planet, and he thanks Lucrecia for being the reason he survived. He is <b>then</b> <b>found</b> by Shelke outside the cave, and she tells him that everyone else is waiting for him.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} {{home from the}} {{sanatorium}} in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, {{he was laid off}} and granted unemployment benefits. He <b>then</b> <b>found</b> work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} progresses, Clay learns that Rip {{also had a}} fling with Rain and is now obsessed with her. When Clay discovers that Julian is {{currently}} Rain's boyfriend, he conspires with Rip to hand Julian over to him. When Julian is <b>then</b> <b>found</b> murdered, Rain confronts Clay {{about his role in}} the affair and is raped by him in response. He later receives a video of Julian's murder from Rip which has been overdubbed with an angry voicemail from Clay as a means to implicate him in the crime. The novel then depicts sequences of the savage sexual and physical abuse of a beautiful young girl and young boy, perpetrated by Clay. Clay experiences no feelings of remorse or guilt for this, for Julian's death, or for exploiting and raping Rain. In the last scenes, it is strongly implied that Blair has been hiring people to follow Clay. In return for his giving her what she wants, she offers to provide Clay with a false alibi that will prevent the police from arresting him as an accomplice to Julian's murder.|$|E
5|$|Celtic <b>then</b> <b>found</b> {{themselves}} {{embroiled in}} a series of controversial matches in the second round against Rapid Wien. Celtic lost the first leg 1–3 in Vienna, but despite rough-house tactics from the Austrians, it was only Celtic's Alan McInally who found himself red-carded. The return match at Parkhead was an even more bad-tempered affair as Celtic raced to a 3–0 lead with goals from Brian McClair, Murdo MacLeod and Tommy Burns, all in spite of Rapid's foul play. The match erupted near the end when Burns was punched by Reinhard Kienast. In the ensuing chaos, coins and at least one bottle were thrown onto the pitch by some Celtic fans. None appeared to hit anybody, but one of the Rapid Wien players, Rudi Weinhofer, was carried off the pitch with his head swathed in bandages. The match finished 3–0, with Celtic winning the tie 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E

After Lisa's hair was {{revealed to be}} green, Zara and Abby accuse Steph of doing the hair wrong on purpose and make her leave the house claiming she was jealous of Lisa's good looks, Steph was devastated about losing her friends. An oblivious Steph did not realised that she is being stalked by serial killer, Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg). It {{was part of a}} storyline that had been running in the background for while. He attacked her, and proceeds by stabbing her in the head and leaving her to die. Steph was <b>then</b> <b>found</b> unconscious and she woke up a week later in hospital where she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Steph {{was the only one of}} Toby's victim to survive an attack.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but <b>then</b> <b>found</b> he did not have time to do so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's {{early life}} was heavily {{influenced}} by {{his relationship with his}} uncle Henry I. Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother William Rufus. In 1106 he invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother, Robert Curthose, defeating Robert's army at the battle of Tinchebray. Henry <b>then</b> <b>found</b> himself in conflict with Louis VI of France, who took the opportunity to declare Robert's son William Clito the Duke of Normandy. Henry responded by forming a network of alliances with the western counties of France against Louis, resulting in a regional conflict that would last throughout Stephen's early life. Adela and Theobald allied themselves with Henry, and Stephen's mother decided to place him in Henry's court. Henry fought his next military campaign in Normandy, from 1111 onwards, where rebels led by Robert of Bellême were opposing his rule. Stephen was probably with Henry during the military campaign of 1112, when he was knighted by the King, and was definitely present at court during the King's visit to the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in 1113. Stephen probably first visited England in either 1113 or 1115, almost certainly as part of Henry's court.|$|E
