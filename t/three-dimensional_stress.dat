40|$|A stress {{distribution}} of composite patch with an aluminum substrate {{was obtained by}} using stress functions and Kantorovich method when the substrate was under uniaxial extension and pure bending moment. The principle of complementary virtual work was applied to obtain the governing equations. The obtained <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>stresses</b> satisfied the traction free conditions at the free edges and the top surface of the patch.

The interlaminar stresses reached maximum at the free edge and decreased quickly at the inner part of the patch. To demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method, cross-ply, angle-ply, and quasi-isotropic laminates patches were studied. Since the proposed analysis accurately predicts <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>stresses</b> in a composite patch not only uniaxial extension case, but also pure bending case, it is promising to use as an efficient tool for analyzing and designing such aerospace structural component.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the fatigue {{behaviour}} of complex, <b>three-dimensional,</b> <b>stress</b> concentrations under multiaxial loadings. Starting from the stress field obtained {{by means of a}} linear elastic analysis and taking advantage of the so-called implicit gradient approach, a safety factor is calculated for high-cycle fatigue. In this first attempt, attention has been focused on the stress-invariant based approaches in the high-cycle fatigue regime. The multiaxial damage evaluation is obtained by analysing the full loading path of the Crossland 5 -dimensional invariant deviatoric stress in Euclidean space by means of the variance reference frame. Explicit analytical solutions of the proposed criterion are given in the case of biaxial sinusoidal loads. The method was validated by comparison with experimental data involving multiaxial in-phase and out-of-phase loading of specimens which contained <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>stress</b> concentrations.

Recently, a unique <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>stress</b> state was mathematically derived to describe the experimental stresses applied to isolated living cells suspended in an optohydrodynamic trap (optical tweezers combined with microfluidics).
