5|$|It is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte's Royal English Opera House for Sullivan's grand opera Ivanhoe in late 1890 {{and early}} 1891, and for André Messager's La Basoche in 1891–92. He {{also worked for}} Carte at the Savoy as {{assistant}} to François Cellier on The Nautch Girl in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan's music and later insisted on programming his concert works when {{they were out of}} fashion in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an oratorio, St. Dorothea (1889), a light opera, Daisy (1890), and a one-act comic opera, Returning <b>the</b> <b>Compliment</b> (1890).|$|E
5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned <b>the</b> <b>compliment</b> by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.|$|E

He opened the scoring in the 17th minute to put them 1–0 up with a shot into the bottom left corner. He scored his second goal in the 56th minute, tapping in from Antonio Valencia's drilled cross across the six-yard box to extend the lead to 3–1. He was later replaced by winger Ashley Young as the match finished 4–1 to the home side. Nani scored his sixth league goal {{of the season and}} provided two assists in a 5–0 away win at Fulham on 21 December. He first advanced on a run down the left flank before crossing for Danny Welbeck to slot home. He then met a Ryan Giggs cross with his head to glance United into a 2–0 lead. He then returned <b>the</b> <b>compliment,</b> squaring for Giggs to put United 3–0 up before half-time.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{cross-cultural}} study of compliments and compliment responses in American and Persian TV interviews. Based on eight video-taped and transcribed interviews of Oprah Winfrey’s programs with celebrities from MBC 4 channel and eight Persian interviews {{conducted by the}} Iranian TV host Reza Rashid Pour with eight Iranian celebrities, the paper investigated the topic and the function of <b>the</b> <b>compliments</b> and <b>the</b> way interlocutors responded to <b>the</b> <b>compliments</b> in <b>the</b> Persian and American TV interviews. The project set out to examine {{the similarities and differences}} in <b>the</b> <b>compliments</b> and compliment responses of English and Persian TV interviews.

5|$|Rather than {{treating}} Prokofiev as {{a fugitive}} or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider {{him as a}} general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned <b>the</b> <b>compliment</b> by registering in France as {{a citizen of the}} Soviet Union, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded VIP status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with the official Soviet concept of art.|$|E

As an actor, Dixon's physical appearance became a problem – he was six foot three inches tall but only weighed 150 pounds, making for a very lanky appearance.

Despite <b>the</b> <b>compliment,</b> Dixon returned home to North Carolina in shame.|$|E
25|$|Off of San Juan, Captain Wise {{realized}} that he must pass the Spanish guns at Morro Castle and sail into the harbor {{to determine if the}} Spanish Fleet was anchored there. Because Yale had not been painted gray, she still looked like a passenger liner. Wise knew that the Spanish government was trying to acquire passenger ships and that one of the vessels potentially available was the Anchor (former Inman) City of Rome, which was almost identical to the Yale. In fact, City of Rome was later chartered by the Spanish. The Captain ordered the Union Jack raised along with City of Rome's recognition signals as Yale passed the fort. After determining that the Spanish Fleet was not in the harbor, Yale dipped her flag in salute as she returned to sea. The Spanish returned <b>the</b> <b>compliment,</b> not realizing that an American auxiliary cruiser was directly under the fort's guns. When out of range, Yale captured the Spanish Steamer Rita and put a prize crew aboard to sail her to Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{function}} of <b>compliment</b> is <b>the</b> establishment or reinforcement of solidarity between {{the speaker and}} the addressee.

However, observing how native speakers respond to <b>the</b> <b>compliments,</b> we would find various ways of responding besides denying. This paper attempts to study the following questions: (1) what type of compliment responses are prevalent in Japanese (2) how native speakers of Japanese <b>complimented</b> shift <b>the</b> way of responding to <b>the</b> <b>compliments</b> depending on <b>the</b> interlocutor's age, status, and sex (3) how language teachers should deal with <b>compliment</b> responses in <b>the</b> classroom.

25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if he could say some words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without a clue that he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one person for a role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning <b>the</b> <b>compliment,</b> Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to make a joke on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E

[...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that it is precisely the isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E
