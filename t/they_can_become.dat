5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are classified}} mainly as baroclinic, because they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient known as frontal zones. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> barotropic late {{in their life}} cycle, when the distribution of heat around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with its radius.|$|E
5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|During their stellar evolution, some stars {{pass through}} phases where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> {{pulsating}} variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, {{expanding and contracting}} with periods ranging from minutes to years, {{depending on the size}} of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.|$|E

5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale {{was to try to}} carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of organisms' {{bodies are}} usually the most {{informative}} type of evidence. The most common types are wood, bones, and shells. Fossilisation is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism {{before they can be}} observed. Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history. There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms. Further, only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus phyla of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.|$|E
50|$|Fish lice {{occasionally}} reach {{high enough}} densities to cause fish kills in aquaculture operations, or more rarely in wild populations of fish. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>become</b> abundant in aquaria, sometimes {{resulting in the}} death of ornamental fish.|$|R
50|$|Anisodus tanguticus is a {{perennial}} plant. It has flowers that are mostly solitary and borne in leaf axils. The flowers are mostly star shaped and radial. Most {{of them are}} nodding but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> sometimes <b>become</b> erect.|$|R

5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E
5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on the}} edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} young, Sam breaks into the orphanage {{he was thrown}} out of to get to Nathan, and tell him some grim news. To make up for the bad part, Sam leads Nathan to the house of Evelyn,a {{historian}} who was legally sold their mother's belongings. They attempt to retrieve the items, but are caught. Evelyn called the police before she knew that the boys were the offspring of Cassandra Morgan, an employee of hers. Evelyn collapses from her lung disease and the boys are associated with her death. They flee, and Sam prompts Nathan that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> explorers, under the new surname of Drake. It is implied that Sam , around 19 or 20 years old was behind bars when Nathan around 14 or 15 years old stole Francis Drake's ring in Columbia, and when he first partnered with Victor Sullivan, he presumably later met Victor but never saw him eye to eye, and distrusted him.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} often curious about divers {{when they first}} enter the water and may {{approach}} quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> dangerous {{in the presence of}} food, and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather than on the reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. Photographing the display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a grey reef shark attacked the researchers' submersible multiple times, leaving tooth marks in the plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks (none of them fatal) attributable to this species.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>become</b> quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
