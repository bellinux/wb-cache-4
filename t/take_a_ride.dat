[...] He also commented on the lyrics saying that [...] "'Let's have some fun, this beat is sick / I wanna <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> on your disco stick' might be the trashiest-yet-awesomest refrain I've heard on a major-label record this year." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized the song for [...] "cheap" [...] lyrics and [...] "painfully enunciat without any resemblance of actual sex appeal". While reviewing The Fame, BBC said that the song sounded robotic in the line [...] "I wanna <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> on your disco stick", though deemed it a brilliant track which [...] "leaves us awarding Gaga the yearbook title of 'pop star most likely to kill'." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy {{believed}} that lines like [...] "I wanna <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>ride</b> on your disco stick" [...] {{was a direct}} reason of Gaga's commercial success.
