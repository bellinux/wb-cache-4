Therefore, the risk from a mixture of phthalates or phthalates and other anti-androgens, may not be accurately assessed studying one chemical at a time. The same may be said about risks from several exposure routes together. Humans are exposed to phthalates by multiple exposure routes (predominantly dermal), while <b>toxicological</b> <b>testing</b> is done via oral exposure.|$|E

50|$|Rall {{developed}} the NIEHS Extramural Program to administer an expanding portfolio of PHS grants and awards {{in environmental health}} science to researchers at colleges and universities throughout the United States. Rall served as the U.S. coordinator of cooperative environmental health programs between the United States and the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, Egypt, Japan, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Italy, Finland, and Spain. As {{a result of his}} work in attempting to strengthen international scientific cooperation, in 1975 the NIEHS was designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Collaborating Center for Environmental Health Effects. In 1980, Rall played a leading role in an effort to establish the WHO's International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), the goal of which is to provide an internationally evaluated scientific basis for the assessment of the risks to {{human health and the environment}} of chemicals.In 1978, the NIEHS was designated as the focal point for the establishment of the NTP, a cooperative effort to coordinate <b>toxicological</b> <b>testing</b> programs within the Department of Health and Human Services, and Rall was appointed its director. Also, during that NTP-formative era, Rall helped establish the 1978 Public Law that initiated the innovative Report on Carcinogens. He was the author of some 200 scientific publications and was awarded the DHEW Distinguished Service Medal of the PHS and the Arnold J. Lehman Award of the Society of Toxicology.

30|$|Based on {{the recent}} experience, reasons for {{non-compliance}} can be various. One example of non-compliance with legal provisions is that the exemptions from the registration requirements are not correctly understood. A very common {{problem is that the}} identity of the substance under consideration is often not clear or even incorrect [10]. Furthermore, the definition of intermediates and the term ‘strictly controlled conditions’ (SCC) is interpreted differently between the authorities and some companies [11]. To avoid unjustified <b>toxicological</b> <b>tests,</b> read-across approaches are made or certain <b>toxicological</b> <b>tests</b> are waived for unjustified reasons. Furthermore, the compilation of registration dossiers is performed very differently by each SIEF and different registrants may comply differently in a way not readily understandable for competent authorities or the downstream users. Non-compliance with the legal framework will occur when these assumptions, and estimations are not disclosed and/or not justified and when the technical dossier and the CSR are inconsistent. A non-exhaustive summary of these discrepancies is summarised in column 3 of Additional file 1.|$|R
