Sales in the United States began in March 2006 as a 2006 model, with the initial U.S. model lineup including the GS 300 (GRS190), featuring a ULEV certified 3.0-liter 3GR-FSE V6 engine, and the GS 430. The GS 300 featured a D4 direct-injection fuel system for all markets except Continental Asia, excluding Singapore, becoming Toyota's first vehicle equipped with direct injection sold in the United States. The 3.0-liter engine was {{also found in the}} Toyota Mark X as well as the Zero Toyota Crown, however the new GS 300 was never offered in the Japanese market. The GS 300, GS 350, and GS 430 engine options were paired to a new 6-speed automatic sequential shift gearbox. An all-wheel drive system was made available in the GS 300, thus becoming the first Lexus sedan to offer such a configuration; the system varied the front/rear wheel <b>torque</b> <b>split</b> anywhere from 50/50 to 30/70 depending on conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic <b>torque</b> <b>split</b> converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E

The new issues include additional optimization criteria, constraints and relevant dynamics to deal with.

State constraints are modified {{to account for}} plug-in hybrid vehicles. Moreover, specific supervisory control problems are recognized to need additional state variables. The latter comprise: engine and catalyst temperature to deal with engine warm-up effects on fuel consumption and after-catalyst emissions; thermal dynamics of heat recovery systems (Rankine or Thermo-Electric Generators, TEGs); and battery temperature, which influences battery performance and aging. It is shown that all these control problems can be treated in an unified fashion by extending the well-known ECMS (Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy), which is an implementation of Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) as formulated by optimal control theory.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{modelling}} and control methodologies {{applied to a}} heavy truck equipped with a parallel hybrid electric drivetrain. The actuator redundancy, typical of the mild-hybrid vehicle configuration, allows the powertrain control system to enhance the vehicle drivability, in terms of smooth driving and promptness, while reducing transient diesel engine emissions, in comparison with conventional pure thermal engine vehicles. The electric motor, characterised by a high-bandwidth torque control, is here utilised not only to dampen the driveline oscillations that arise during rapid torque transients, e. g., when the driver accelerates the vehicle at full load in low gears, but also to keep the engine working with slow torque gradients, as required by transient emission reduction strategies. The driveline is modelled by lumped parameters, considering also the damping effects of the tyres. A detailed non-linear model is used as reference for the performance comparison of different simplified linear models. The best linear model is selected and used {{for the design of}} a LQR-based closed-loop controller aiming at reducing the driveline torsional vibrations.

40|$|Rotorcraft {{transmission}} {{design is}} limited by empirical weight trends that are proportional to the power/torque raised to the two-thirds coupled with the relative inexperience industry has with the employment of variable speed transmission to heavy lift helicopters {{of the order of}} 100, 000 lbs gross weight and 30, 000 installed horsepower. The advanced rotorcraft transmission program objectives are to reduce transmission weight by at least 25 %, reduce sound pressure levels by at least 10 dB, have a 5000 hr mean time between removal, and also incorporate the use of <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> technology in rotorcraft drivetrains of the future. The major obstacle that challenges rotorcraft drivetrain design is the selection, design, and optimization of a variable speed transmission in the goal of achieving a 50 % reduction in rotor speed and its ability to handle high torque with light weight gears, as opposed to using a two-speed transmission which has inherent structural problems and is highly unreliable due to the embodiment of the traction type transmission, complex clutch and brake system. This thesis selects a nontraction pericyclic continuously variable transmission (P-CVT) as the best approach for a single main rotor heavy lift helicopter to target the above mentioned obstacle for drivetrain design and provides advancement {{in the state of the}} art of drivetrain design over existing planetary and <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> transmissions currently used in helicopters. The goal of the optimization process was to decrease weight, decrease noise, increase efficiency, and increase safety and reliability. The objective function utilized the minimization of the weight and the constraint is the tooth bending stress of the facegears. The most important parameters of the optimization process are weight, maintainability, and reliability which are cross-functionally related to each other, and these parameters are related to the torques and operating speeds. The analysis of the <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> type P-CVT achieved a weight reduction of 42. 5 % and 40. 7 % over planetary and <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> transmissions respectively. In addition, a 19. 5 dB sound pressure level reduction was achieved using active gear struts, and also the use of fabricated steel truss like housing provided a higher maintainability and reliability, low cost, and low weight over cast magnesium housing currently employed in helicopters. The static finite element analysis of the <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> type P-CVT, both 2 -D and 3 -D, yielded stresses below the allowable bending stress of the material. The goal of the finite element analysis is to see if the designed product has met its functional requirements. The safety assessment of the <b>split</b> <b>torque</b> type P-CVT yielded a 99 % probability of mission success based on a Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic- petri net analysis and a failure hazard analysis. This was followed by an FTA/RBD analysis which yielded an overall system failure rate of 140. 35 failures per million hours, and a preliminary certification and time line of certification was performed. The use of spherical facegears and pericyclic kinematics has advanced the state of the art in drivetrain design primarily in the reduction of weight and noise coupled with high safety, reliability, and efficiency.
