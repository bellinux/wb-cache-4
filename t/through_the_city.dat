5000|$|The region may {{be defined}} as the {{catchment}} area from which employees and students commute into <b>the</b> <b>city</b> on a daily basis. It is the catchment area from which people choose to visit one city, as opposed to another, for retail shopping and entertainment. Economically <b>the</b> <b>city</b> region may include the hinterland that depends on its wholesale markets, banking facilities, transport hubs and information exchanges. The region needing integration may be seen as the zone from which perishable foods, firewood and building materials supply <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>The</b> economic region can also {{be defined as the}} area managed by exchanges in <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Telephone calls to <b>the</b> region go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> telecom exchange; post goes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> general post office; money transfers go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>city’s</b> financial institutions and internet data passes electronically <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>city’s</b> servers. <b>The</b> area over which “city exchanges" [...] disperse matter can well be called <b>the</b> <b>city’s</b> economic hinterland or region.
