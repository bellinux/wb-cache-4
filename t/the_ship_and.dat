5|$|On October 16, {{with the}} ship's coal stores running low, Captain Budington {{decided to run}} the Polaris aground near Etah.

They built a hut from lumber salvaged from <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> <b>and</b> on October 24, extinguished the ship's boilers to conserve coal. The bilge pumps stopped for good, and the ship heeled over on her side, half out of water. Fortunately, the Etah Inuit helped the men survive the winter.
