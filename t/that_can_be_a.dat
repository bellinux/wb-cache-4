5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

25|$|In Portugal, {{university}} and college attendance before the 1960s, including {{for the period}} of Portuguese monarchy which ended in 1910, and for most of the Estado Novo regime (1920s - 1974), was very limited to the tiny elites, like members of the bourgeoisie and high ranked political and military authorities. In addition, there were few institutions of higher education, low levels of secondary education attainment, and a high illiteracy rate for Western European standards. However, during {{the last decade of the}} Estado Novo regime, from the 1960s to the 1974 Carnation Revolution, secondary and university education experienced the fastest growth of Portuguese education's history. Today higher education, which includes polytechnic institutions and university institutions, is generalized but very heterogeneous, with different tonalities and subsystems. Overcrowded classrooms, obsolete curricula, unequal competition among institutions, frequent rule changing in the sector and increasingly higher tuition fees (inside the public higher education system, although much smaller than private institution fees) <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> financial burden for many students, have been a reality until the present day, though some improvements have been made since the Bologna Process implementation in 2007/2008. The Bologna Process created a more uniform and homogeneous higher educational system, at least within the public {{university and}} polytechnical institutions. Nearly 40% of the higher education students do not finish their degrees, although an undisclosed number of those students are subsequently readmitted into other courses or institutions of their choice. Despite their problems, many good institutions have a long tradition of excellence in teaching and research, where students and professors can attain their highest academic ambitions.|$|E

500|$|In November 2007, The Scotsman {{reported}} that Rowling had threatened {{legal action against}} American computer programmer G. Norman Lippert for allegedly violating her intellectual property rights by producing and publishing the online novel, James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing, an unofficial and unauthorised continuation of the Harry Potter series. [...] Written as a fan fiction project for Lippert's wife and sons, the novel is set eighteen {{years after the end}} of the last official installment in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and describes the adventures of Harry Potter's son, James Sirius Potter, during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A specialist in intellectual property law at Strathclyde University commented that, [...] "If an insubstantial character from a novel is taken and built up by another author in a new story, <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> defence against copyright infringements." [...] However, after Lippert offered Rowling an advance copy of the novel, Rowling dismissed her threat and said she supported the novel and any others like it. Lippert subsequently produced a sequel, James Potter and the Curse of the Gatekeeper. After the novel first appeared online in early November 2007, some Harry Potter fans on the Internet initially speculated that the site might be part of an elaborate viral marketing campaign for an official continuation or spinoff of Harry Potter, one either written or at least approved by Rowling herself. On 9 November 2007, Rowling's agent Neil Blair denied that Rowling was in any way involved with the purported project, and Warner Bros., the studio which owns the rights to the Harry Potter film series, denied that the novel was in any way connected to the official Harry Potter franchise.|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "it played out as it did not just because of Artie and Becky's condition but because of what they’re like as people". VanDerWerff said the story was [...] "handled with just the right level of pathos", and Slezak praised the writers for turning Becky [...] "into a fully realized character, while confronting head-on the dashed hopes and disappointments <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reality for a person with Down Syndrome". Sullivan wrote, [...] "The plot touched on a universal experience, unrequited love, from a very Glee perspective, the treatment of handicapped people as people. It ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed Sue and Becky's touching dynamic." [...] Bell liked Sue in this episode, as she was helping the plot, which in turn made her one-liners [...] "added treats rather than overdone cliches". The use of Helen Mirren to voice Becky's thoughts was highly praised. Poniewozik called it [...] "the kind of ridiculous-but-weirdly-logical move I love from Glee", and Lynch said it [...] "was one of the most charming treats this show has offered in a while".

500|$|The {{film was}} not without its detractors. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It's {{a measure of how}} the film {{operates}} that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like Jaws, characters are simply functions of the action... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as [...] "the sort of nonsense <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good deal of fun". Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that [...] "Jaws is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written." [...] Marcia Magill of Films in Review said that while Jaws [...] "is eminently worth seeing for its second half", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was [...] "often flawed by its busyness". William S. Pechter of Commentary described Jaws as [...] "a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons" [...] and [...] "filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort"; Molly Haskell of The Village Voice similarly characterized it as a [...] "scare machine that works with computer-like precision.... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that [...] "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up", and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, [...] "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide stated that [...] "despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster." ...|$|E
