40|$|In this research, coal {{combustion}} behavior across {{the regions of}} blowpipe, tuyere, and raceway of blast furnace are numerically examined. Three different lance configurations, including a single lance, a double air-cooled coaxial lance, and an oxy-coal lance with different oxygen enrichment patterns, are taken into consideration. The {{coal combustion}} efficiency by the double <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> is 5. 1 % higher than that by single <b>lance</b> <b>injection.</b> From the calculated temperature by the oxy-coal lance, coal ignition is retarded due to the cooling effect of enriched oxygen flowing through the lance annulus, resulting in the moderation of pressure loss within the raceway. Most importantly, the enriched oxygen becomes the combustion enhancer in the downstream of coal plume after ignition is triggered. Consequently, the coal burnout under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> is comparative to that under the double air-cooled <b>lance</b> <b>injection.</b> The performance of blast furnace may be improved with the advantages provided by the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> <b>injection.</b> Compared with the single <b>lance</b> <b>injection,</b> coal trajectories under the oxy-coal <b>lance</b> <b>injection</b> are closer to the tuyere exit due to the higher inertia force of coal particles against hot blast.

The three-dimensional, transient and non-isothermal flow of melt, slag and oxygen has been simulated for a 335 t {{combined blowing converter}} with six-hole <b>top</b> <b>lance</b> and 14 bottom tuyeres. The calculation {{is based on the}} Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the Standard k-ε model. The time-dependent formation of the melt cavities is modeled by the Volume of Fluid (VoF) approach. In order to simulate the stirring gas plumes, individual argon bubbles are released from each bottom tuyere. The bubbles are treated as dispersed phase and modeled using the Discrete Phase Model (DPM). The fundamental flow phenomena such as the penetration of the supersonic oxygen jets, the motion of the phase interfaces, the behavior of the gas plumes and the interaction with the bulk flow as well as the heat transport in the refractory lining are predicted reasonably well. However, the blowing process can only be calculated for a limited process period due to computing-time reasons. Thus, the mixing time, which gives information on the homogenization process, is calculated for pure bottom-blowing. The CFD model provides an efficient tool to describe and further improve the combined blowing process...|$|R
40|$|One way {{to further}} utilize {{produced}} gases {{in an integrated}} metallurgical plant is to replace oil or coal with gas as a reducing agent in a blast furnace. Therefore, it is {{of great interest to}} study the injection of reducing gas into the blast furnace. A fundamental three-dimensional mathematical model has been developed where the injection of the gas by lances into the tuyere is simulated. The model includes the coupled solution of the flow field and the combustion reactions of the gases inside the tuyere. The combustion reactions are modeled using a simple reaction scheme with three possible reactions that can occur. Two different types of fuel gas have been modeled, namely coke oven gas (COG) and basic oxygen furnace gas (BOF). The influence of the following parameters on the predicted velocities, temperatures and composition of the gas at the tuyere outlet are examined in this study: i) comparison between the two types of gases using one <b>injection</b> <b>lance,</b> ii) <b>injection</b> amount of coke oven gas, iii) the use of one or two <b>injection</b> <b>lances,</b> and iv) the influence of the injection angles when using two <b>injection</b> <b>lances.</b> The modeling technique is presented and discussed as well as the implied results. The results show that the coke oven gas is combusted more completely than the BOF gas, which leads to higher flame temperature of the blast. Furthermore, the combustion conditions are better when using two <b>injection</b> <b>lances</b> compared to when using one <b>injection</b> <b>lance</b> and the predicted results are not affected to a large degree when the injection angles are changed. The modeling of the raceway is so far not included in the model, hence the influence of the outlet boundary condition at the tuyere is not reflected in the presented results...|$|R

The process has been operative since 1930 ’s for recovering zinc from lead blast furnace slag. Though slag fuming is a well-established process and has been industrially operative for over eighty years, there is only limited understanding of the process kinetics and fluid flow behaviour inside the slag fuming furnace. The {{purpose of this study is}} detailed fluid dynamic analysis including combustion behaviour, gas-liquid momentum interaction, generation of splashing due to gas injection process in slag fuming furnace, analysis of fuming behaviour at different locations of the furnace by using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling technique. This PhD thesis focuses on the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the zinc slag fuming process. In the first stage of the present research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling study of the <b>Top</b> Submerged <b>Lance</b> (TSL) gas <b>injection</b> process was carried out in a laboratory scale isothermal air-water model. The multiphase flow simulation, based on Euler-Euler approach, elucidated the effect of swirl and non-swirl flow inside the bath. The effects of lance submergence level and air flow rate were also investigated in that phase. The simulation results for velocity fields and generation of turbulence in the bath were validated against existing experimental data from the previous water model experimental study of Morsi et al. [1]. In the next stage of the research, a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of the pilot plant scale <b>top</b> submerged <b>lance</b> slag fuming furnace was developed to investigate details of fluid flow, combustion behaviour, reaction kinetics and heat transfer in the furnace. The model integrates submerged CH 4 combustion at the lance tip and chemical reactions with the heat, mass and momentum interfacial interaction between the phases present in the system. Commercial CFD package AVL Fire 2009. 2 (AVL, Graz, Austria) coupled with a number of user defined subroutines in FORTRAN programming language were used to develop the model. The model is based on 3 -D Eulerian multiphase flow approach and it predicted the velocity and temperature field of the molten slag bath, generated turbulence, vortex and plume shape at the lance tip. The model also predicted the mass fractions of slag and gaseous components inside the furnace. The model was validated by adopting the macro – step validation approach by using the zinc fuming rate against the pilot plant scale experimental study on <b>top</b> submerged <b>lance</b> zinc fuming process carried out by Waladan et al.

The effects of the lance submergence level and the air flow rate also were investigated. The simulation results for the velocity fields and the generation of turbulence in the bath were validated against existing experimental data from the previous water model experimental study by Morsi et al. [1] The model was extended to measure the degree of the splash generation for different liquid densities at certain heights above the free surface. The simulation {{results showed that the}} two-thirds lance submergence level provided better mixing and high liquid velocities for the generation of turbulence inside the water bath. However, it is also responsible for generating more splashes in the bath compared with the one-third lance submergence level. An approach generally used by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system simulations was applied to predict the convective mixing phenomena. The simulation results for the air-water system showed that mean convective mixing for swirl flow is more than twice than that of nonswirl in close proximity to the lance.

Mechanisms of droplet generation and mechanisms of the effect of bottom blowing on droplet generation were investigated in a 2 -D water model, using high speed cinephotography. Two mechanisms of the droplet generation, 2 ̆ 2 dropping 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 swanning 2 ̆ 2, were found, corresponding to low and high jet gas flow rates respectively. Ejection of individual droplets and liquid fragments are characteristics of the 2 ̆ 2 dropping 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 swarming 2 ̆ 2 regions respectively.
