50|$|The movie {{begins in}} The San Francisco Bay Area briefly {{touching}} {{on the history}} of wine and the existence of the prestigious Master Sommelier exam. The film’s main characters, Ian Cauble, Dustin Wilson, DLynn Proctor, and Brian McClintic are introduced along with their various family members, wives, and girlfriends who all vouch for just how invested they really are in preparing for their Master Sommelier diploma. Every one of them has a different motive for wanting to pass, whether it is for their wife’s sake, an obsession with the idea of passing, or simply wanting to be seen as the most dapper guy in a restaurant.

5000|$|The {{complexity}} of the [...] "input-output table" [...] {{can also lead to}} rigidity. Decentralized global supply chains lead to many firms competing for the same inputs and producing the same outputs, but an individual firm does not know whether the other firms and industries will be affected the same way in a shock. Cutting prices in a situation would not necessarily create more demand for a firm's products; it may just lead to lower profits and bankruptcy. Firms face large information requirements in determining how to optimize their pricing. They not only have to know the demand for their own goods and their own costs, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the pricing factors for all their competitors and other firms in the vast market of inputs and outputs. Capital market imperfections lead to more real rigidities. Capital markets may have asymmetric information problems because borrowers are better aware of their situation than lenders. This can lead to firms seeking more external finance during downturns, which drives up the firm's cost and creates another rigidity. Imperfect information can also create rigidity in the consumer market. Consumers may see price as an indicator for quality. Firms may be reluctant to cut their prices if they fear that consumers might start to the product as [...] "cheap".|$|E
5000|$|... 1) Priority of rights, freedom, and {{legitimate}} interests of citizens {{in front of}} the interests of the state. For instance, all citizens have equal rights to access civil service. Application to civil service is voluntary. Civil service takes into account public opinion and publicity, excluding activities with state secrets. 2) The unity of the civil service system. In other words, all three branches of the state power - legislative, executive, and judicial powers - are united and interdependent between each other. 3) Transparency and effectiveness of the activities of public bodies. Compulsory execution of particular decisions by subordinate public bodies and civil servants. Subordinate public agencies and their civil servants are accountable for their performances. All public agencies are accountable in front of people. 4) The principle of meritocracy. It is fair award and promotion of civil servants for their merits and achievements, for exemplary performance of official duties and unblemished public service. They have equal remuneration for the performance of equivalent work. 5) The principle of professionalism of civil servants. Civil servants are considered as Kazakhstani patriots and intolerant to violations. They are personally responsible for improper performance of their official duties. Also <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and keep rules of ethics during their duties. 6) Training of civil servants. Civil servants have legal and social protection. In addition, they have an opportunity for training, retraining and development of necessary competencies.|$|E
