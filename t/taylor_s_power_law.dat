40|$|The {{relative}} importance of Pseudocercospora macadamiae conidia produced from the subepidermal stromata of diseased husk {{and the effect of}} climatic factors on husk spot epidemics were assessed on managed (fungicide-protected) and unmanaged macadamia trees. The spatial pattern of diseased fruit in the tree canopy was quantified using the binary form of Taylor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> <b>law</b> on 54 trees for 4 years. The a and b parameters of the <b>power</b> <b>law</b> showed year-to-year variations in the unmanaged epidemic. This was attributed to differences in climatic conditions and the amount of early infection in the tree canopy. Overall, diseased fruit aggregated, heterogeneity was in excess of the levels expected for a random pattern (a > 1; b > 1), and the degree of aggregation increased with the incidence mean. The rate of increase in disease incidence was significantly lower in the managed rather than the unmanaged epidemic. However, the rates of increase of disease severity were comparable, suggesting that other factors contribute to abscission of diseased fruit. The effect of each climatic factor examined on disease severity wa...|$|R

40|$|Multiple myeloma is a {{plasma cell}} cancer {{that affects the}} bones, immune system, and kidneys. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} impact on the bone, {{specifically}} routine bone remodeling. The bone remodeling process is governed by chemical signaling between several cell populations. In multiple myeloma patients, this process is out of balance. Bone destruction outpaces bone replacement, leaving patients with bone lesions. We describe the cell-signaling network that regulates bone remodeling and explain how it is impacted by multiple myeloma. We then present a series of mathematical models describing the bone remodeling process. We lay a thorough mathematical foundation, starting with the derivation of Savageau 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> <b>law</b> approximations. Next, we introduce a novel one-dimensional moving-boundary partial differential equation model of this biological system.

Image processing techniques, such as the ones presented here, could be used for validation of the models we present.

40|$|Assessing, managing, and {{communicating}} variance and risk {{is fundamental to}} effective ecological decision making. One promising approach is to borrow concepts from financial portfolio management. Ecological populations behave like portfolios in many ways—we can treat the abundance of populations, such as salmon in streams, as financial stock value, and groups of populations, such as salmon within a river catchment, as portfolios. If a group of populations react differently to an environmental event then the probability of sudden decline may be lowered, similar to a diversified financial portfolio. This risk reduction {{has been referred to}} as the portfolio effect. In this thesis I consider three applications of portfolio concepts to ecology. I begin by evaluating ways of estimating portfolio effects and applying these metrics to moth, reef fish, and salmon metapopulations from around the world. I show an inherent bias to a commonly used method, develop a new method based on Taylor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> <b>law</b> of mean [...] variance scaling, and outline recommendations for estimating portfolio effects. Next, I use a portfolio approach to inform conservation priorities for salmon populations under a changing climate. I show that preserving a diversity of thermal tolerances minimizes risk and ensures persistence given long-term environmental change. However, this reduction in variability can {{come at the expense of}} long-term persistence if climate change increasingly restricts available habitat, forcing ecological managers to balance society 2 ̆ 7 s desire for short-term stability and long-term viability. Finally, I take the concept of black swans (extreme and unexpected events) from the financial literature and ask what the evidence is for these events across hundreds of bird, mammal, insect, and fish abundance time series.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{ballistic}} aggregates on deterministic fractal substrates is studied {{by means of}} numerical simulations. First, we attempt {{the description of the}} evolving interface of the aggregates by applying the well-established Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling approach. Systematic deviations from that standard scaling law are observed, suggesting that significant scaling corrections have to be introduced in order to achieve a more accurate understanding of the behavior of the interface. Subsequently, we study the internal structure of the growing aggregates that can be rationalized in terms of the scaling behavior of frozen trees, i. e., structures inhibited for further growth, lying below the growing interface. It is shown that the rms height (h_s) and width (w_s) of the trees of size <b>s</b> obey <b>power</b> <b>laws</b> of the form h_s∝ s^ν_∥ and w_s∝ s^ν_, respectively. Also, the tree-size distribution (n_s) behaves according to n_s∼ s^-τ. Here, ν_∥ and ν_ are the correlation length exponents in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the interface, respectively. Also, τ is a critical exponent. However, due to the interplay between the discrete scale invariance of the underlying fractal substrates and the dynamics of the growing process, all these <b>power</b> <b>laws</b> are modulated by logarithmic periodic oscillations. The fundamental scaling ratios, characteristic of these oscillations, can be linked to the (spatial) fundamental scaling ratio of the underlying fractal by means of relationships involving critical exponents.

40|$|The {{cranberry}} fruitworm, Acrobasis vaccinii (Riley) (Pyralidae), is {{the most}} important insect pest of Massachusetts cranberries. The female lays her eggs individually in the calyxes of developing fruits. Upon hatching, the larva cats its way into the fruit and consumes it, whereupon it moves to another. Because the immatures are protected inside fruits, insecticides target the adult and egg stages. Growers wishing to practice integrated pest management (IPM) engage scouts to collect and check berries for eggs to determine whether spraying is warranted. However, their protocol was devised with limited knowledge of egg distribution or the relationship between eggs found and yield loss. Better understanding of the oviposition behavior of the female and of egg distributions is essential for effective monitoring. ^ The quest to optimize scouting efficiency led me to explore the physical properties of cranberries and their immediate environment in order to identify factors influencing oviposition. Mechanosensory stimuli, including surface texture, conformation, size, geoörientation, and moisture content of the oviposition substrate, are important determinants in insect oviposition site selection, comprehensively reviewed in Chapter 1. In laboratory choice experiments described in Chapter 2, I manipulated the surface texture, conformation and geöorientation of cranberries and showed that physical contact with a natural calyx is important in eliciting oviposition. In field choice experiments, I showed that females are more likely to oviposit on the uppermost berries and on berries growing in abundant foliage. ^ The balance of my research was designed to characterize the egg spatial distribution in commercial cranberry bogs and to develop an empirically-based IPM scouting protocol. Six bogs were intensively sampled and their egg distributions were modeled in Chapter 3 using Taylor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Law</b> (<b>Taylor,</b> 1961), variance = a*meanb. However, exponential and logarithmic versions of the model produced different regressions. Comparisons of their performance demonstrated that exponential models usually produced more satisfactory descriptions of the variance to mean relationship. Analyses of the published data sets Taylor employed, presented in Chapter 4, obtained comparable results. In Chapter 5, I developed and tested a new scouting protocol based on the exponential model, which outperformed the original protocol in field trials. ...|$|R

40|$|Under certain conditions, freely {{decaying}} magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence evolves {{in such a}} {{way that}} velocity and magnetic field fluctuations delta v and delta B approach a state of alignment in which delta v proportional to delta B. This process is called dynamic alignment. Boldyrev has suggested that a similar kind of alignment process occurs as energy cascades from large to small scales through the inertial range in strong incompressible MHD turbulence. In this study, plasma and magnetic field data from the Wind spacecraft, data acquired in the ecliptic plane near 1 AU, are employed to investigate the angle theta(tau) between velocity and magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind as a function of the time scale tau of the fluctuations and to look for the scaling relation similar to tau(1 / 4) predicted by Boldyrev. We find that the angle appears to scale like a <b>power</b> <b>law</b> at large inertial range scales, but then deviates from <b>power</b> <b>law</b> behavior at medium to small inertial range scales.
