5|$|Players {{create a}} {{character}} and travel around Sucia Island, a location Barred {{to the members}} of the player character's sect. Whilst searching for a way off the island, the game's ultimate goal, players can form alliances with the island's inhabitants and complete quests through combat or other means. Geneforge is played in 45° axonometric perspective, movement through the game's environs is real-time but switches to turn-based combat in the game's playing field. The game world is divided up into 77 areas accessible through a world map. The first two areas serve as the game's tutorial; introducing players to navigation, controls and shaping creations. Clearing areas by defeating guardians or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing <b>travelling</b> <b>time.</b> The game has an always-visible auto-map, which begins each area completely darkened, and is revealed as the player explores. As the player's party performs tasks or defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and additional skill points. The player character's skill points can be used to increase their statistics or to improve their aptitude in one of the fifteen available skills. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|With {{the move}} of the {{majority}} of the AIF to France, the base organisation was transferred to the United Kingdom. Most of the training units moved to the Salisbury Plain, establishing depots at Perham Down, Rollestone, Larkhill and Tidworth. When it arrived, the 3rd Division also moved into camps in this area. Command Depots, where men returning from hospitals were sent before being returned to their units, were established at Perham Down, Weymouth, Wool, Dorset and Worgret. Depots for men moving from the United Kingdom to France were established at Étaples. In June 1917, these were swapped with the Canadians for depots around Le Havre, thereby reducing <b>travelling</b> <b>time</b> from the Salisbury Plain. AIF Headquarters was established at Horseferry Road in London and Colonel R. M. McC. Anderson, a businessman, was appointed as its commandant.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{distribution}} {{of different types}} of urban roads, the link and path average <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> and variance estimation methods by analyzing the large-scale <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> dataset detected from automatic number plate readers installed throughout Beijing. The results show that the best-fitting <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution for different road links in 15 min time intervals differs for different traffic congestion levels. The average <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> for all links on all days can be estimated with acceptable precision by using normal distribution. However, this distribution is not suitable to estimate <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variance under some types of traffic conditions. Path <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> can be estimated with high precision by summing the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> of the links that constitute the path. In addition, the path <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variance can be estimated by the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variance of the links, provided that the <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> on all the links along a given path are generated by statistically independent distributions.

40|$|A {{negative}} effect of congestion {{that tends to}} be overlooked is <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty. <b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty causes scheduling costs due to early or late arrival.

In this paper, a network <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution model based on the Johnson curve system is proposed.

We further investigate the network-level <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> reliability by connecting the network reliability measures such as the weighted standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate and the weighted skewness of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate distributions with network traffic characteristics (e. g., the network density). The weighting is done with respect to the number of signalized intersections on a trip. A clear linear relation between the weighted average <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate and the weighted standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate can be observed for different time periods with time-varying demand. Furthermore, both the weighted average <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate and the weighted standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rate increase monotonically with network density.

40|$|<b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> {{reliability}} {{are important}} performance measures for assessing traffic condition {{and extent of}} congestion on a roadway. Most commonly used methods to obtain <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data either produce only estimates of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> or too few <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data points for meaningful analysis. This study focuses on using a new probe vehicle technique, the Bluetooth technology, to collect two weeks of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data on Interstate- 69 in Indianapolis. These data are then used to estimate econometric models, {{which can be used}} to predict freeway segment <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> ^ First, an autoregressive model is estimated based on the collected data. Individual vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> on a freeway segment are expressed as a function of speed, volume, time of day indicators, and previous vehicle <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> In addition to the autoregressive formulation, a duration model is estimated based on the same <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> data. The duration model enables calculation of the probability of the vehicle exiting the segment of the road at any point in time. The estimated models indicate that the rate of vehicles exiting the segment as a function of their <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> rises initially until the inflection point and then decreases. It is hypothesized that the inflection point occurs at the onset of congestion, when longer <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> may not result in a higher probability of exiting the freeway segment. Lastly, a seemingly unrelated regression equation model to predict <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and intervehicle variability is proposed. This model predicts 15 -minute interval <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and the standard deviation of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> based on speed, volume and time of day indicators.

40|$|A common way to {{determine}} values of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and schedule delay is by estimating departure time choice models using revealed preference (RP) data.
