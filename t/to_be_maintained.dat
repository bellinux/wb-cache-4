In April 1997, Elections Canada conducted a final house-to-house enumeration throughout Canada to establish the preliminary National Register of Electors, which was used for the Canadian federal election that June.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{would need}} a {{significant}} manpower expansion of 2,800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships. The Commission {{believed that it was}} unlikely that sufficient Dutch citizens would volunteer, and that as a result Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI. Strong segregation between white and Indonesian sailors was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} lesson learned is {{that a number of}} ecosystems, including the one that contains Yellowstone, are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires. This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988, and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home. While large destructive fires are unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities, they are mandatory in a region such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, if it is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> in a natural manner.|$|E

5|$|BCal {{entered into}} a bid to acquire at least one Concorde. However, BCal {{eventually}} arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required {{a high level of}} aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax. Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage. Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E

5|$|During Operation Desert Storm, Loring's tankers were {{responsible}} for refueling aircraft transiting the Atlantic. It was also used as a stopover for aircraft travelling to the Persian Gulf region due to its vital position. The base was also vital because it allowed planes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained,</b> planes which sometimes {{would be unable to}} reach their destination without maintenance. Between 2 August 1990 and 10 May 1991, more than 1,700 aircraft transiting between America and the Persian Gulf region landed at Loring. These included the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy, C-130 Hercules, C-21A, A-4 Skyhawk, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Boeing 707, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, F-111 Aardvark, P-3 Orion, TR-1A Dragonlady, U-2 Dragonlady, B-52 Stratofortress, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, E-3A Sentry, EA-6B Mercury, and E-8A Joint Stars aircraft.|$|E

A bulwark was built {{on the east side of}} the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town's quay, just to the west. For most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament; following the Restoration, it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s.|$|E

However, so long as the Japanese posed a threat to New Zealand's security, there was still political will for the 3rd Division <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained.</b> With the Japanese no longer a meaningful concern to the country, New Zealand's increasing shortage of manpower resulted in the disbandment of the 3rd Division. As well as providing reinforcements for the 2nd New Zealand Division, at the time engaged in fighting in Italy, it allowed men to return to vital industries in New Zealand.|$|E

Among the aspects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> are her admiration for Audrey Hepburn and her interest in Yale University. However, the series is also noted for its deviations from the source material, including the exclusion of Blair's brother Tyler. The show also explores romances between Blair and multiple male leads, resulting in occasional love triangles. In the fifth season, Blair is revealed to be pregnant with Prince of Monaco, Louis Grimaldi's child. However the child later dies before birth after a car crash Blair and Chuck were in.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes {{proposed}} a freeway along the US 40 corridor {{in order to}} alleviate increased traffic along that route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, which was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify {{the construction of a}} freeway along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E

5|$|Preparations for the {{disposal}} of equipment began {{in the second half}} of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed the military to survey all stocks and indicate any surpluses. General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hindered these preparations as he believed they were premature and that the Army's stocks needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> until Japan was defeated. This position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army, and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their surpluses, but was successful in delaying the Disposal Commission's work until July 1945. As a result, relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945.|$|E
5|$|Sweden, at {{that time}} an expansionist empire with an army {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>maintained</b> by the revenues of occupied territory, was conscious that a direct attack on her main adversary Russia could well result in a Dano-Polish–Russian alliance. Also, Sweden was prevented from forming a Swedish–Polish alliance by the refusal of John II Casimir to drop his claims to the Swedish crown and the unwillingness of the Polish–Lithuanian nobility to make the territorial and political concessions an alliance with Sweden would eventually cost, final negotiations in Lübeck during February 1655 ended without a result. Thus, Sweden opted for a preemptive attack on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to occupy its yet available territories before the Russians.|$|E

The Ebenezer Avery House was the location where the British brought the injured soldiers after the Battle of Groton Heights on September 6, 1781.
