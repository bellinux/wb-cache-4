5000|$|In 2006, {{the station}} added some local air personalities who were {{previously}} at WJMK {{when it was}} an oldies station. Eventually, the station was live and local (which included hosts such as John Landecker, Dick Biondi, Greg Brown, and Danny Lake) except for overnights, when they would continue <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>True</b> Oldies Channel programming. The [...] "True Oldies Channel" [...] programming would be dropped in the Fall of 2012.In 2007, Walt Disney Company sold its ABC Radio radio division, including WLS (AM) and WZZN, to Citadel Broadcasting. From 2007 to 2008, the oldies format was modified to include {{a small amount of}} 1980s' hits and a focus on oldies from 1964 to 1979. The station continued to play a couple pre-1964 oldies per hour. On June 19, 2008, Citadel announced that WZZN would become once again WLS-FM. The WZZN call letters were dropped at Midnight on June 25, 2008, and as of 12:01 a.m. on June 26, 2008, the station has officially been known as WLS-FM. The idea was to bring back the heritage of WLS and its old Top 40 format and jingles. The station now branded as [...] "94.7 WLS-FM" [...] with the slogan [...] "Chicago's Greatest Hits Of All Time." [...] Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.|$|E

These low-cost Unix systems allowed small businesses <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a <b>true</b> multi-user system and share resources (disk, printers) before networking was common.

40|$|Efforts to {{determine}} the etiologies of mood disorders have been hampered by heterogeneity of groups and failures to replicate findings. One strategy for overcoming these difficulties is to subtype disorders based on observable features {{in order to obtain}} more homogeneous groups. The groups obtained by such procedures can then be studied {{to determine}} if they comprise valid subtypes with distinct characteristics and etiologies. The current study examined 100 individuals from 21 multiplex families selected through a proband with mood disorder, as well as 25 control subjects free of Axis I mental disorder. The probands in the main family groups had all met diagnostic criteria for a highly genetic subtype of mood disorder; either rapid cycling bipolar disorder or recurrent unipolar depression. The patterns of psychopathology and normal personality variation were studied in the families of these probands. These data were used to test hypotheses predicting how the family groups would differ from each other and from normal controls. Results confirm that subtypes of mood disorder tend <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>true</b> but are also associated with increased familial risk for panic and substance use disorders. Family members of probands had increased levels of Axis II pathology: relatives of patients with recurrent unipolar depression most clearly showed increased levels of Cluster B problems, especially borderline traits, while relatives of rapid cycling bipolar patients had increased levels of obsessive-compulsive traits. Family members of probands with mood disorder also differed from controls in their pattern of scores on a measure of normal personality variation. Both groups of family members showed an elevation on the Negative Emotionality factor. However, the specific pattern of personality traits which deviated from control scores differed slightly between the two family groups. The significant differences from normal controls seen in the two groups of family members on measures of personality disorder and normal personality held even when considering only those family members who had never had a mood disorder. Study results were consistent with distinct familial subtypes of mood disorder. ...|$|E

50|$|If {{the rotor}} of a {{squirrel}} cage motor were <b>to</b> <b>run</b> at the <b>true</b> synchronous speed, the flux in the rotor at any given place on the rotor would not change, and no current would be created in the squirrel cage. For this reason, ordinary squirrel-cage motors run at some tens of RPM slower than synchronous speed. Because the rotating field (or equivalent pulsating field) effectively rotates faster than the rotor, {{it could be said}} to slip past the surface of the rotor. The difference between synchronous speed and actual speed is called slip, and loading the motor increases the amount of slip as the motor slows down slightly. Even with no load, internal mechanical losses prevent the slip from being zero.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the same}} in the engine-room, when the ships come in for their regular looking-over. Those who love them, which you would never guess from the language, know exactly what they need, and get it without fuss. Everything that steams has her {{individual}} peculiarity, and the great thing is, at overhaul, to keep to it and not develop a new one. If, for example, through some trick of her screws not synchronising, a destroyer always casts to port when she goes astern, do not let any zealous soul try <b>to</b> make her <b>run</b> <b>true,</b> or you will have to learn her helm all over again. And it is vital that you should know exactly what your ship is going to do three seconds before she does it. Similarly with men. If any one, from Lieutenant-Commander to stoker, changes his personal trick or habit--even the manner in which he clutches his chin or caresses his nose at a crisis--the matter must be carefully considered in this world where each is trustee for his neighbour's life and, vastly more important, the corporate honour.|$|R
