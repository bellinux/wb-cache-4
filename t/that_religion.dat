5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated because they make statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> {{is significant}} because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God.

Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for his {{philosophy}} {{though he did not}} accept <b>that</b> <b>religion.</b> It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism.

Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E

5|$|In The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, Durkheim's first {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} the social origin and function of religion as he felt <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> {{was a source of}} camaraderie and solidarity.

5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of <b>that</b> <b>religion.</b> In the opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings are in {{some ways}} similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is {{considered}} single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings {{is the goal of}} a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem.

Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> should be a private matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E

40|$|Few {{seem to have}} {{difficulty}} in distinguishing between religious and secular institutions, yet there is widespread disagreement regarding what "religion" actually means. Indeed, some {{go so far as}} to question whether there is anything at all distinctive about religions. Hence, formulating a definition of "religion" that can command wide assent has proven to be an extremely difficult task. In this article I consider the most prominent of the many rival definitions that have been proposed, the majority falling within three basic types: intellectual, affective and functional definitions. I conclude that there are pragmatic reasons for favouring the formerly popular view that essentialist definitions of "religions" are inadequate, and <b>that</b> <b>religions</b> should be construed, instead, as possessing a number of "family resemblances". In so arguing, I provide a response to the view that there is nothing distinctive about religions, as well as to the recent claim <b>that</b> <b>religions</b> do not exist...|$|R
