25|$|Ford Global Technologies, 2006, patent #7029017, Wheel {{suspension}} for {{a motor vehicle}} with a <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|E
50|$|Suspension {{employed}} <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> both {{front and}} rear.|$|R
50|$|Although the Ford <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were retained, {{the front}} {{suspension}} was made independent.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a four-cylinder 1213 cc ohv {{water-cooled}} engine producing at maximum power [...] at 4,200 rpm. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed prop shaft. Front suspension: Independent using <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> Rear suspension: independent using <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with floating half-axles. Top speed: 105 km/h.|$|R
25|$|ZF {{released}} a concept rear suspension design, in October 2009, using a composite spring-based rear suspension. The strut-based suspension uses a <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> {{to function as}} both ride and anti-roll spring. The ZF concept differs from the system used on the Corvette by using the leaf spring {{as one of the}} suspension links.|$|E
25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate {{rack and pinion steering}} while still using <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> suspension. The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced in the summer of 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the anti-roll bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the anti-roll bar) to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> across the vehicle results in an anti-roll bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter anti-roll bar, and even eliminating the rear anti-roll bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|E
50|$|Springing of the {{coupled axles}} was {{achieved}} using overhung <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The spring elements were linked by equalising beams. On the carrying axles, <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> were used.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{manufactures}} have produced vehicles or concepts utilizing independent front or rear suspensions supported by <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> {{that have an}} anti-roll effect.|$|R
50|$|The brakes {{remained}} mechanically operated {{using the}} Girling rod system with 10 in drums and the chassis still had <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> front and rear.|$|R
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
2500|$|... front it {{consisted}} of double wishbones, with a thick sheet steel (4mm) upper wishbone, lever-arm Houdaille hydraulic dampers, longitudinal torsion bars, and lower location through a transverse leaf spring; {{at the rear of}} swing axles and radius arms, with a <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> and longitudinal torsion bars.|$|E
2500|$|The 8C 2900 was {{designed}} to compete in sports car races {{in general and the}} Mille Miglia in particular. [...] It used the 2.9L version of the 8C engine and was based on the 8C 35 Grand Prix racing chassis. As such, it had an inline 8-cylinder 2.9-litre engine using two Roots type superchargers fed by two updraught Weber carburettors and fully independent suspension with Dubonnet-type trailing arm suspension with coil springs and hydraulic dampers at front and swing axles with a <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The {{front axle}} has {{suspension}} by <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> While Tatra 11 had drum brakes {{only on the}} rear wheels, Tatra 12 had drum brakes all around.|$|R
50|$|The 125 S used a steel tube-frame chassis and had {{a double}} {{wishbone}} suspension with <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> in front with a live axle in the rear. Hydraulic power drum brakes were specified front and rear.|$|R
50|$|Front suspension: {{upper and}} lower <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> curved {{downward}} to raise roll centre. Generous ground clearance and travel. No antisway bar, {{which resulted in the}} lifting of one rear wheel in hard cornering. Kingpins integral with the steering knuckles, turning in sockets pivoted on the <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> eyes.|$|R
2500|$|TVR Number Two {{began with}} the same chassis design found on the first car, using the rear axle, springs, dampers, brakes, and {{steering}} from the Morris Eight, {{as well as the}} same sidevalve Ford engine. However, the front suspension design was changed to use wishbone control arms and a single <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring.</b> The bodywork was again constructed by Les Dale, and it was similar in appearance to the first car. An auto enthusiast local to Blackpool purchased the car for use in competition, although it was eventually registered for road use in 1952. Around this time, the car was refreshed: it received a new body style with a lower nose, and some different instrumentation and equipment (including a tachometer from a Supermarine Spitfire and Marchal headlamps from a Delage.) ...|$|E
2500|$|For 1964 {{significant}} engineering changes occurred, {{while the}} model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged. The engine displacement was increased from [...] {{by an increase}} in stroke. The base engine power increased from , and the high performance engine increased from [...] The Spyder engine rating remained at [...] despite the displacement increase of the engine. 1964 saw an improvement in the car's swing axle rear suspension {{with the addition of a}} <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear roll stiffness and foster more neutral handling. Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy duty suspension was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} the T43 design {{was replaced by}} the Mark III version of the [...] "Formula Two" [...] chassis. Maddock and the Coopers upgraded the existing design by switching the front suspension for an improved double wishbone suspension arrangement with coilover shock absorbers, in place of the older cars' <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> design. New step-up gears in the transaxle allowed Maddock to lower the engine (now including Climax's stretched [...] FPF in the works Formula One car), reducing the centre of gravity of the new Cooper T45 (Mark III) by mounting the dry-sump engine much lower. Maddock credited this particular innovation to Jack Brabham, who received the suggestion from his Australian friend, Ron Tauranac. Brabham and Cooper contributed other detail improvements, but Maddock left the fundamental chassis frame virtually unaltered from the T43. The T45 was immediately successful. In the hands of Maurice Trintignant, Rob Walker's new T45 won the very next World Championship round, the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|The {{front wheels}} are driven through a four-speed gearbox with column shift, with {{synchromesh}} {{on the upper}} three gears. Suspension at the front is provided by two <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> and at the back by three torsion bars each side.|$|R
50|$|The new XC90 has a {{redesigned}} chassis {{with double}} wishbone front suspension {{and a new}} integral link rear axle incorporating <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> of lightweight material. The new XC90 can also be equipped with electronically controlled air suspension with a choice of five modes.|$|R
50|$|All 1907 models {{featured}} half-elliptic springs at {{the rear}} as well as <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs,</b> and while shaft drive appeared that year, chain drive was retained on luxury models until 1911. In 1908, the Type 32 was the company's first to offer an L-head monoblock engine.|$|R
2500|$|In 1935, {{to compete}} with Mercedes Benz and Auto Union, Enzo Ferrari (Race team manager) and Luigi Bazzi (Designer) built a racer with two 3.2 (3.165-litre) engines, one {{in the front and}} one in the rear, giving 6.3litres and [...] The {{drivetrain}} layout was unusual. The two engines were connected by separate driveshaft to a gearbox with two input shafts, and two angled output shafts, so each of the rear wheels had its own driveshaft. It could never quite succeed against the Mercedes W25 B of Rudolf Caracciola, and was hard on fuel and tyres. The gain in speed was offset by increased pit times. On May 12, 1935, two were entered in the Tripoli Grand Prix driven by Nuvolari and Chiron who finished fourth and fifth. Chiron managed a second at the following 1935 Avus race. On June 16, 1935 Nuvolari drove a specially prepared Bimotore from Florence to Livorno and set a new speed record [...] with an average speed of over [...] After that it was sidelined in favour of the Tipo C. It was the first racer to use the Dubonnet independent trailing arm front suspension. The V12 was under development, but was not race ready. It was noticed that the Bimotore had a traction advantage on rough ground, so a version of the Bimotore chassis with the independent Dubonnet front end, and a new independent rear with swing axles with radius rods and a <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> was used for the Tipo C 3.8s.|$|E

50|$|The {{tubular steel}} chassis was a short-wheelbase {{version of the}} 1800 saloon, {{featuring}} <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>sprung</b> independent suspension at the front and a live axle with semi-elliptic springs at the rear. The rear track was wider than the front by some 4 inches. Brakes were hydraulic.|$|R
50|$|Clemons' later four {{cylinder}} chassis included deep-sectioned {{side rails}} with a raised section {{over the front}} axle, which carried the oil tank. The rear section was deep-skirted. The front and rear cross-members were tubular with <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> and ‘Hartford’ type shock absorbers fitted length wise along the chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} was by {{the traditional}} Ford <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> front and rear and the engine drove the rear wheels through a three-speed gearbox which, right from the start, featured synchromesh between the top two ratios. The maximum speed was just under 60 mph (95 km/h) and fuel consumption was 32 mpgimp.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} consisted of equalising beams with coil springs; the equalising beams were {{located within the}} bogie 'sandwich type' side frame, whilst the secondary suspension utilised a two bolsters per bogie incorporating four <b>transverse</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>springs.</b> The locomotive weight was carried on four sliding elements on the bolster, with a center pivot used to transfer tractive forces.|$|R
