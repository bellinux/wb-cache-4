5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E

After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had spent so much <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E

5|$|Hamar was {{the center}} for skating sports during the 1994 Winter Olympics. The other venue in town was Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, which {{featured}} the short track speed skating and figure skating events. Vikingskipet held ten speed skating events, five for men and five for women. Norway's Johann Olav Koss took three golds, in the men's 1,500 meters, 5000 meters and 10000 meters. In the latter two, he finished ahead of fellow countryman Kjell Storelid. The men's 500 meters was won by Russia's Aleksandr Golubev ahead of fellow countryman Sergey Klevchenya, while the men's 1000 meters was won by American Dan Jansen. Koss and Jansen won their olympic golds setting new world record <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> distances. For women, American Bonnie Blair defended her two 1992 golds in 500 meters and 1000 meters. Austria's Emese Hunyady won the 1500 meters ahead of Russia's Svetlana Bazhanova and Germany's Gunda Niemann. However, Bazhanova took gold ahead of Nemeth-Hunyady on the 3000 meters, with Germany's Claudia Pechstein in third. Pechstein {{would go on to}} win the 5000 meters ahead of Niemann.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

5|$|There were twenty number-one albums on {{this chart}} in 2001, {{including}} the first Spanish language album by Christina Aguilera, which spent five weeks at the top in 2001 and 14 weeks in 2000 and won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. Ricky Martin, Marco Antonio Solís, Conjunto Primavera and Los Tigres del Norte hit the top spot for the second <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> careers, respectively. Singer-songwriter Marc Anthony with Libre achieved his third chart-topper on this list. Grupo Bryndis became the third act to release two number-one albums in the same year, after Tex-Mex performer Selena on 1995 and 1996 (see: Top Latin Albums of 1995 and Top Latin Albums of 1996) and Enrique Iglesias in 1999 (see: Top Latin Albums of 1999).|$|E
25|$|Although the {{screenplay}} for Raging Bull was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote Mean Streets), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including Jay Cocks (who {{went on to}} co-script later Scorsese films The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro. The American Film Institute chose Raging Bull as the No. 1 American sports film on their list of the top 10 sports films. In 1997, the Institute ranked Raging Bull as the 24th greatest film of all <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. In 2007, they ranked Raging Bull as the 4th greatest film of all <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) list.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decade}} {{preceding}} Unix, computers had grown enormously in {{power to the}} point where computer operators were looking for new ways to get people to use their spare <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> machines.

25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{emphasis}} was put on toys that had an educational purpose to them, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah's Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> hands, {{which led to the}} application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} cricket {{in the mid}} and late 19th century was {{assisted}} {{by the development of}} the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.|$|E

25|$|Later the District {{became the}} site of the battles around Rostov in November 1941 where the Germans {{suffered}} defeat, and the Battle of Stalingrad, which has been described as the most ferocious battle to date. Following the conclusion of the Battle of the Caucasus, the North Caucasian Front and the headquarters of the 56th Army were disbanded in accordance with a Supreme Command directive of the 20 November 1943. The Independent Coastal Army was formed, for the second <b>time,</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> base.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{cellular}} phones, {{such as the}} iPhone, has created the inability to be in social isolation, and the potential of ruining relationships.

25|$|An {{organised}} domestic cricket league {{was first}} {{established in the}} 1903–04 season, and was won during its inaugural year by the Army Ordnance Corps.
