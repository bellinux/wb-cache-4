5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> as a man that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling {{her that he was}} in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.|$|E

25|$|When Gladstone came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> {{in later}} years, he was {{astonished}} to find that Parnell was ignorant even of the basic facts of Irish history.

25|$|During {{the late}} 1890s, {{he had begun}} making use of the Șărcăleanu alias in his polemic articles, which became a {{particular}} topic of dispute after his confrontation with Dioghenide (who first speculated that Stere {{was the author of}} Șărcăleanus articles). Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper Naționalul, consequently pressured Stere to indicate who Șărcăleanu was ("We wish <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him,</b> does he wear sidelocks or is he a Judaisized Romanian?"). Similar calls were voiced by Vieața, who alleged that Stere himself was a Russian Jew.|$|E

25|$|Ralph Mershon never married. He died February 14, 1952, in Coconut Grove, Florida. His Papers are {{preserved}} by Ohio State University Archives. In 1956 Ohio State University Press published a two volume biography by Edith D. Cockins, who was registrar of the University from 1895 to 1944. From the account, she came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> first when the alumni association was invigorated by his Presidency. The first volume recounts Mershon's life and engineering projects, {{the second is}} an edited and annotated collection of his writings. His suggestions {{for the improvement of}} the patent system are found on pages 142 and 143 of volume one.|$|E
25|$|Eventually Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep {{the mouse}} reach the world's end, where Aslan {{appears as a}} lamb before {{transforming}} into a lion (a scene that refers to John 21:12, where Jesus appears after his resurrection and makes a breakfast of fish for his disciples). He shows Reepicheep {{the way to his}} country and helps the children return home. He tells Edmund and Lucy that, like Peter and Susan, they have become too old to return to Narnia, and that they must instead come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> in their world—a relatively direct reference to the Christian theme of the series. He does not say whether Eustace will return to Narnia.|$|E

25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George who seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about {{when and how}} to {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I was in a position <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him.</b> I regret that I had not a chance <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>him</b> better." ...|$|E
