25|$|During the 1930s, many Nationalist Party {{leaders and}} wide {{sections}} of the Afrikaner people came strongly {{under the influence of}} the Nazi movement which dominated Germany from 1933 to 1945.

Many Nationalists, moreover, believed that the opportunity to re-establish their lost republic would come with the defeat of the British Empire in the international arena. The more belligerent Hitler became, the higher hopes rose that a new era of Afrikanerdom was about <b>to</b> <b>dawn.</b>|$|E
