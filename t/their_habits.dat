5|$|Auks are seabirds {{which are}} superficially similar to {{penguins}} with their black-and-white colours, their upright posture {{and some of}} <b>their</b> <b>habits,</b> but the living species are able to fly. There are about 23 species worldwide, four of which are rare vagrants in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, {{are more}} {{restricted}} in <b>their</b> <b>habits,</b> but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but {{can happen in}} great numbers to exhausted adults after large storms, an event known as a wreck, where they provide prized sightings for birders.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were also very shrimp-like in <b>their</b> <b>habits.</b> They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphidromus are {{arboreal}} — in other words, they are tree snails. However, more {{detailed information on}} <b>their</b> <b>habits</b> is still lacking. The general feeding habits of these snails are unknown, but a few species are known to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae. Amphidromus themselves are preyed upon by birds, snakes, and probably also by smaller mammals such as rats.|$|E

5|$|Each June, on Garter Day, {{the members}} of the Order, wearing <b>their</b> <b>habits</b> and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an {{investiture}} ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their wives. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.|$|E
5|$|Offshore: A third {{population}} of killer whales {{in the northeast}} Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, {{it may be that}} they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about <b>their</b> <b>habits,</b> but they are genetically distinct from residents and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.|$|E
5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and <b>their</b> <b>habits</b> are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, the Islamic {{concept of}} hell may {{resemble}} {{the concept of}} Catholic doctrine of Purgatory, for Jahannam just punishes people according to their deeds, and releases them after <b>their</b> <b>habits</b> are purified.

25|$|Bird eye size is broadly {{related to}} body mass. A study of five orders (parrots, pigeons, petrels, raptors and owls) showed that eye mass is {{proportional}} to body mass, but as expected from <b>their</b> <b>habits</b> and visual ecology, raptors and owls have relatively large eyes for their body mass.|$|E
