5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant.|$|E

5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its {{extensive use of}} asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot {{be used due to}} the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E

5|$|The Jugal Region, or Neala, is {{a region}} of the wing that is usually a small {{membranous}} area proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section of the wing and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves to yoke the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary and recently developed part of the wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid.

Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies.

It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Results are {{presented}} of a quantitative biostratigraphic {{study of the}} calcareous nannofossils from the upper Miocene Metochia section (Gavdos Island, Greece) located in the eastern Mediterranean. The study allows {{the completion of the}} calcareous nannofossil Zonal Scheme for the Mediterranean Neogene. Parts of the scheme have already been proposed earlier for the Plio-cene-Pleistocene (Rio et al. 1990 b) and for <b>the</b> latest Oligocene <b>to</b> early late Miocene (Fornaciari and Rio 1996, Fornaciari et al. 1996). The Metochia section proved to be a suitable section for high-resolution biostratigraphic studies. It has a detailed planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy and a robust chronology <b>based</b> on <b>the</b> astronomical calibration of the sedimentary cycles (Krijgsman et al. 1995, Hilgen et al. 1995). Age estimates for the nannofossil biohorizons recognized in the section were obtained through direct correla-tion to this astrochronology. Five out of seventeen biohorizons were selected for biostratigraphic purposes and <b>to</b> define <b>the</b> (sub) zonal boundaries. They are (in stratigraphic order) : LO (Last Occurrence) of Discoaster hamatus Martini and Bramlette 1963, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Subzone MNN 10 a, dated at 9. 53 Ma; FCO (First Consistent Continuous Occurrence) of Discoaster pentaradiatus (Tan 1927) Bramlette and Riedel 1954, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Subzone MNN 10 b, at 9. 37 Ma; PB (Paracme Beginning) of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus (Gartner 1967) Gartner 1969, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Zone MNN 11 a, at 8. 76 Ma; FO (First Occurrence) of Amaurolithus spp. (A. primus (Bukry and Percival 1971) Gartner and Bukry 1975), equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Subzone MNN 11 b, at 7. 42 Ma, and FO of Nicklithus amplificus (Bukry and Percival 1971) Raffi Backman and Rio 1998, equivalent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Subzon...|$|R

5|$|The tower-keep had {{a modest}} entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the {{surrounding}} moat, which initially reached right up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, {{which was in}} contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, {{and would have been}} difficult for an attacker to drain. On {{the east side of the}} castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in a 2016 study, examination of melanosomes preserved in the specimen of Psittacosaurus preserved with integument indicated that the animal was countershaded, likely due to preferring a habitat in dense forests with little light, much like many modern species of forest-dwelling deer and antelope; stripes and spots on the limbs may represent disruptive coloration. The specimen also had dense clusters of pigment on its shoulders, face (possibly for display), and cloaca (which may have had an antimicrobial function), as well as large patagia {{on its hind legs}} that connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail. Its large eyes indicate that it also likely had good vision, which would have been useful in finding food or avoiding predators. The authors pointed out that there might have been variation in coloration across the range of the animal, depending on differences in the light environment. The authors were unable to determine which species of Jehol Formation Psittacosaurus the specimen belonged to due to the way the skull is preserved, but ruled out P. mongoliensis, based on hip features.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls {{has been compared to}} those of modern frogs and salamanders, but the presence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth in small, paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth, but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. Calcification resumes at the base, leaving an area {{in the center of the}} tooth uncalcified. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils.|$|E

5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convection zone, where it again picks up heat {{from the top of the}} radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
5|$|The colour {{alone is}} not a {{reliable}} guide to determine the species, as some scarlet robins (P.boodang) take on an orange hue, but while male scarlet and red-capped robins (P.goodenovii) have red breasts and black throats, the flame robin's breast plumage extends right up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill. It is also a little slimmer and has a smaller head than the scarlet robin, and is clearly larger than the red-capped. Females of the respective species are harder to tell apart. Those of red-capped, rose and pink robins are all smaller, with wing lengths less than , smaller than the smallest flame robin. The female scarlet robin has a more pronounced red flush to the breast and the spot on the crown above the bill is more prominent and white rather than off-white.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E
