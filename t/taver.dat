5000|$|Although This Day Forward {{seems to}} be {{permanently}} defunct, nearly all of its members {{have been involved in}} various musical endeavors since 2003. Mike Shaw and Mike Golen are working on a musical tentatively titled Chateau, which is expected to be released in late 2016. Shaw has also done guest vocals for local band A Trunk Full of Dead Bodies on an unreleased track called [...] "The First to Dance" [...] which also featured Rachel Minton of Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer. Gary has re-entered the working world, while Frangicetto and Ekstrom have teamed up with former Saosin vocalist Anthony Green to form the well-known Circa Survive. Vadim <b>Taver</b> had teamed up in an acoustic emo side project called Superstitions of the Sky with former Hot Cross guitarist Josh Jakubowski even before This Day Forward had split up. He also appeared on Hot Cross's 2004 EP Fair Trades and Farewells, Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer's first full length [...] "Jalopy Go Far" [...] and played guitar and performed lead vocals in Marigold before leaving and moving to California in summer 2006. In 2010, <b>Taver</b> released his debut solo album Expand, Escape on Falling Leaves Records.|$|E

Guitarist Vadim <b>Taver</b> {{said in an interview}} with http://silentstagnation.de/ [...] "This was a good analogy to our music because it's hard to capture the energy, power, and emotion of music on recordings. Sometimes people pull it off, but overall it's not the same as seeing a band perform live, and that was the meaning behind the quote." ...|$|E

50|$|The now {{dilapidated}} Gowri Vilasam {{is built}} in the architectural style of the Tirumala Naikas, which has some features of the Rajaputana arts. There was a clock on the front gate of the facade on the southern side of this place, no longer in a working condition. Within the palace is the Temple of Sri Raja Rajeshwari, with the deity Raja Rajeswar of the Royal House of Sivaganga.

The temple also has a statue of the king Kandumekki Woodaya <b>Taver.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The band re-released {{the album}} on Eulogy Recordings, after {{originally}} releasing it on Break Even records. The band {{thought it was}} a good decision at the moment, but ended up regretting it because they [...] "all hate that record". The reasoning behind this, says guitarist Vadim <b>Taver</b> in an interview with silentstagnation.de [...] "Because those songs were written 4-5.5 years ago. The kind of music it is, is not what the band is feeling right now. We're not a mosh-metalcore band anymore. That's what we were in high school. Most of those songs are horribly written." ...|$|E
50|$|On February 12, Texas {{was set to}} {{reportedly}} hire Purdue {{defensive backs}} coach <b>Taver</b> Johnson; however, Texas would eventually hire Arkansas defensive backs coach Clay Jennings on February 17 to fill the same vacant position at Texas. Concurrently, the Longhorns hired two other coaches to fill Texas coaching vacancies, including former Toledo Rockets co-offensive coordinator Anthony Johnson as a running backs coach on February 13 and former Indianapolis Colts running backs coach Charlie Williams as a wide receivers coach on February 15. Around the same time, Texas A&M pitched an offer to Longhorns defensive line coach Brick Haley, though Haley decided {{to stay with the}} Longhorns.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{document}} of civil suit {{brought before the}} courts in 1904, the names of five trustees who looked after the temple from 1892 till 1904 are Veerasamy, Murugan Chettiyar, Govindasamy Pillai, Veleritta <b>Taver</b> and Meyappah. The temple came under The Mohamedan and Hindu Endowments Board in 1906. From then onwards the temple has been administrated by the management committee appointed by the Endowment Board. It appears that {{from the beginning of}} the Endowments Board's administration, a few temples and other institutions have been clustered and left under the care of this management committee: Arulmigu Sri Balathandayuthapani Temple in Waterfall (Hilltop), the Arulmigu Sri Ganesha Temple in Waterfall, the Arulmigu Sri Mahamariamman Temple in Queen Street, Hindu Cemetery and Cremation Ground in Batu Lanchang and a Hindu Funeral Rites Ground in Jalan Air Itam. From 1967 onwards, the board is known as the Hindu Endowments Board, which is currently managing this temple.|$|E
50|$|While {{with the}} Cleveland Browns and the North Carolina Tar Heels, three of Davis' {{assistant}} coaches {{went on to}} serve as head coaches in some capacity. Everett Withers replaced him as the head coach at North Carolina for the 2011 season. Withers is currently the head coach at Texas State University. The secondary coach in Cleveland under Davis, Todd Bowles served as the interim {{head coach of the}} Miami Dolphins in 2011 and is now the head coach for the New York Jets. Davis' special teams coach in Cleveland in 2004, <b>Taver</b> Johnson, served as the interim head coach of Arkansas for a brief time during the spring following Bobby Petrino's departure and currently is the cornerbacks coach.Bruce Arians served as offensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns under Davis from 2001-2003. After stints as the offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts, Arians served as the interim head coach for the Colts and is now head coach of the Arizona Cardinals.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Transient Effects, Vadim <b>Taver,</b> a friend of the band and former guitarist of the metal band A Life Once Lost (also from the Philadelphia area) joined This Day Forward, and in 2002, this new lineup went on to release the Kairos EP. While Transient Effects had been a {{progression}} from the first release but had stayed more or less true to the same style, Kairos was a definite shift. The riffs were often more subtle and not strictly metal-influenced, and the songs, while still generally heavy, were interspersed with many softer parts. In addition, Shaw varied the vocals greatly, incorporating clean singing and an almost spoken-word-like yelling in addition to his original throaty scream. The album was well received by critics and featured Thursday's Geoff Rickly doing guest vocals {{at the end of the}} song [...] "Sunfalls and Watershine," [...] which received a fair amount of play on college radio stations.|$|E
50|$|The Companion to the Monarch's Own Herald {{is always}} a Grove-Born Stallion, and is {{considered}} {{the leader of the}} Companions. This Companion, currently Rolan, has the ability to bond with a second Herald if the Monarch's Own dies; as Rolan has Chosen both Talamir and Talia (Arrows of the Queen). The Monarch's Own is also subject to this; if his or her Companion dies, it is possible for the Herald to bond to a newly arrived Grove-Born Companion. Also, presumptive Monarch's Own who are also Heralds are only temporarily bonded to their first Companion; though the exact nature of this bonding is not explored (Magic's Promise). The Monarch's Own Companion is not a reborn Herald, they may be true Avatars. <b>Taver</b> was Monarch's Own Companion from the time of Vanyel until his death during the Tedrel Wars several hundred years later, alongside King Sendar. Rolan appeared shortly after and Chose Herald Talamir to stay as Queen's Own.|$|E
5000|$|Arkansas {{head coach}} Bobby Petrino {{was fired in}} early April for lying about his affair with an Arkansas {{employee}} after a motorcycle accident that he had on April that left him four broken ribs, a cracked vertebra in his neck and numerous abrasions on his face. In the press conference announcing the termination, Arkansas Athletic Director Jeff Long said, [...] "(Petrino) {{made the decision to}} mislead the public, (and it) adversely affected the university and the football program." [...] In Petrino's place, Assistant Coach <b>Taver</b> Johnson will serve as interim coach through the end of spring practice. After the firing of Bobby Petrino in April 2012, there was considerable media speculation that Smith would return to Arkansas. This was confirmed on April 23 when multiple media outlets reported that Smith had indeed agreed to succeed Petrino. He was introduced as Arkansas' 29th full-time head coach the next day. Smith signed a 10-month contract, leading to speculation that he was only taking the post on an interim basis for the 2012 season. The Razorbacks' formal announcement described him as [...] "head coach," [...] without any qualifiers; however, it also indicated that Smith's hiring would allow Arkansas to hire [...] "a head coach {{for the future of the}} program" [...] in a more appropriate timeframe following the 2012 season.|$|E
5000|$|This Day Forward {{signed to}} Equal Vision Records in late 2002 with new guitarist Brendan Ekstrom (formerly of 200 North) {{by which time}} they had already {{completed}} several US tours, and {{in the following year}} released In Response. This album strayed even farther from their initial sound, largely abandoning the screams and incorporating more traditional song structures as well as softer backup vocals by <b>Taver.</b> As a result, the band was predictably accused of selling out by some fans, though others still consider it their best and most original work. In the months following the album, the band toured extensively, playing with bands such as Thursday, Murder by Death, Sincebyman, and Christiansen before announcing their breakup in November. The reasons for this are not well known. Among the rumors circulating were that some members were dissatisfied with In Response or disillusioned with the hardcore scene, but none of these appeared substantiated, although at one of their final shows with Poison the Well, Mike walked offstage {{in the middle of a}} song after a fight broke out, saying [...] "and then you wonder why bands break up." [...] The band played the final leg of their last tour in December with Alexisonfire, ending with their last show at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, a cherished local music venue where they had played early in their career.|$|E

40|$|Three {{long-term}} {{temperature data}} series measured in Portugal were studied {{to detect and}} correct non-climatic homogeneity breaks and are now available for future studies of climate variability. Series of monthly minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) temperatures measured in the three Portuguese meteorological stations of Lisbon (from 1856 to 2008), Coimbra (from 1865 to 2005) and Porto (from 1888 to 2001) were studied to detect and correct non-climatic breaks. These series, together with monthly series of average temperature (<b>Taver)</b> and temperature range (DTR) derived from them, were tested in order to detect breaks, using firstly metadata, secondly a visual analysis, and thirdly four widely used homogeneity tests: von Neumann ratio test, Buishand test, standard normal homogeneity test, and Pettitt test. The homogeneity tests were used in absolute (using temperature series themselves) and relative (using sea-surface temperature anomalies series obtained from HadISST 2. 0. 0. 0 close to the Portuguese coast or already corrected temperature series as reference series) modes. We considered the Tmin, Tmax and DTR series as most informative {{for the detection of}} breaks {{due to the fact that}} Tmin and Tmax could respond differently to changes in position of a thermometer or other changes in the instrument's environment; <b>Taver</b> series have been used mainly as control. The homogeneity tests showed strong inhomogeneity of the original data series, which could have both internal climatic and non-climatic origins. Breaks that were identified by the last three mentioned homogeneity tests were compared with available metadata containing data such as instrument changes, changes in station location and environment, observation procedures, etc. Significant breaks (significance 95 % or more) that coincided with known dates of instrumental changes were corrected using standard procedures. It was also noted that some significant breaks, which could not be connected to known dates of any changes in the park of instruments or stations location and environment, were probably caused by large volcanic eruptions. The corrected series were again tested for homogeneity; the corrected series were considered free of non-climatic breaks when the tests of most of monthly series showed no significant (significance 95 % or more) breaks that coincide with dates of known instrument changes. Corrected series are now available within the framework of ERA-CLIM FP 7 project for future studies of climate variability (<a href="[URL]...|$|E
