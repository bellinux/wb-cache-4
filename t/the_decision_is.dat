5|$|In August 2016, the US {{government}} granted {{permission to}} US-based start-up Moon Express {{to land on}} the Moon. This marked {{the first time that a}} private enterprise was given the right to do so. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a precedent helping to define regulatory standards for deep-space commercial activity in the future, as thus far companies' operation had been restricted to being on or around Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to have been killed by their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, but overall the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. In both cases <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> presented as that of some form of council.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} believe their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E

5|$|On 9 April 2014, the FA Council {{announced}} its decision, carried by a 63.5% vote of its members, {{to reject the}} club's application for a name change. The club responded by stating it will appeal the decision. However, {{since there is no}} appeal process with the FA and its Council, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> final. On 11 September 2014, Allam confirmed an appeal has been submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He also held a news conference confirming the club had been put up for sale due to the English FA's decision on 9 April 2014.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria can {{be grown}} in the {{laboratory}} on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases {{can be grown}} in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about six months after <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> made as to what strains of virus {{to include in the}} new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when {{it may be difficult to}} acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.|$|E

5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> later rescinded. Harry is whisked {{off by a}} group of wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because of the trouble that doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one and a half billion BGN for the aircraft alone. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> controversial. Those {{opposed to}} it found the {{reasoning}} poor, considered <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> to <b>be</b> destabilizing of patent law, and expressed concern about long-term effects on medicine.|$|R

5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E
25|$|A three member {{panel of}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit {{reversed}} and remanded the District Court decision. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> particularly relevant to patent law because it set the precedent for treatment of electronic information under the Federal Circuit's public accessibility precedents for prior art. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> also notable for an impassioned dissent-in-part filed by Judge Kimberly A.
