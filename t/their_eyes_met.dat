2500|$|After {{two months}} of interrogations, Rîmaru {{admitted}} to 23 very serious crimes. In fact, he {{had been arrested for}} only three murders; the rest (another murder, six attempted murders, five rapes, one attempted rape, and seven thefts of various degrees) he or his father confessed to. On one hand, he tried to convince the authorities that he was not responsible on the grounds of insanity, and that he did not realize the women would die; on the other hand, he insisted he was guilty, asking to be taken to the scenes of his crimes. During police lineups, victims brought in to identify him would tremble when <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> his, despite there being no danger to them now. Allegedly, for the public at large, Rîmaru's name itself inspired a vague dread; rîmă/râmă means [...] "earthworm" [...] in Romanian.|$|E
60|$|Still {{they came}} from below, boat after boat, in endless procession. The uneasiness of Bill and Kink increased. They stole speculative, {{tentative}} glances at each other, and when <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> looked away in embarrassment. Finally, however, <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> and neither looked away.|$|E
60|$|She {{started at}} his voice, which {{she seemed to}} know, and <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b> <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> and a great light of {{happiness}} shot into her sweet face and shone there till it was covered up and lost in the warm blush that followed.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, when Enriquez {{appeared}} with Chu Chu she ran towards her with outstretched arms. Chu Chu protruded {{about six inches}} of upper lip in response--apparently under the impression, which I could quite understand, that her mistress was edible. And, I may have been mistaken, but <b>their</b> beautiful <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> in an absolute and distinct glance of intelligence! ...|$|R
6000|$|There fell {{between them}} on this a silence of some minutes, after {{which it would}} {{probably}} {{not have been possible}} for either to say if <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>met</b> while it lasted. This was at any rate not the case as Vanderbank at last remarked: [...] "Your brass, my dear young lady, is pure gold!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently Chandraprabha, {{weary of}} sport, left her friends, and singing a lively air, tripped {{up the stairs}} leading to the summer-house. Aroused {{by the sound of}} her {{advancing}} footsteps, Manaswi sat up; and the princess, seeing a strange man, started. But <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>met,</b> and both were subdued by love--love vulgarly called [...] "love at first sight." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b> She {{saw that}} he hated her--and felt relieved.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised her}} willow-patterned tea-cup; Soames did the same. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met,</b> {{and there}} was {{singularly}} little tenderness in their eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> all <b>met</b> as {{each had}} {{glanced at the}} tea-table, where Emilia and Gerald were looking over a report together, but Geraldine shook her head. She was sure that Gerald {{did not think of}} his cousins {{otherwise}} than as sisters, but she was by no means equally sure of Emilia, to whom he was certainly a hero.|$|R
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>met.</b> The bishop {{recalled}} with an agonized distinctness every moment, every error, of that shameful encounter. He {{had been}} too surprised to conceal the state of affairs from the pitiless scrutiny of those youthful eyes. He had instantly made as if to put the cigarette behind his back, and then as frankly dropped it....|$|R
60|$|Then <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>met,</b> he {{had seen}} her sudden start, had felt his heart sink like lead. She was a {{creature}} of common clay after all! His eyes rested for a moment upon her companion, a man well known to him, though of a class for whom his contempt was great, and with whom he had no kinship. She was like this then! It was a pity.|$|R
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b> Langmaid {{looked down}} at the tip of his cigar.|$|E
60|$|This pleased Daffy and Marjorie, and <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> for a moment.|$|E
60|$|This time <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b> The truth {{dawned on}} her--and he saw it.|$|E
60|$|His Uncle sat {{looking at}} him for some time in silence. When <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> at last <b>met,</b> he began at once to pursue the theme that had {{occupied}} his thoughts, aloud, {{as if he had}} been speaking all the time.|$|R
60|$|They {{were within}} twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to avoid his sight. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> instantly <b>met,</b> and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then if we both do--!" [...] She {{had already}} {{turned to the}} fire, nearer to which she had moved, and with a quick gesture had jerked the thing into the flame. He started--but only half--as to undo her action: his arrest was as prompt as the latter had been decisive. He only watched, with her, the paper burn; after which <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> again <b>met.</b> [...] "You'll have it all," [...] Kate said, [...] "from New York." ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met,</b> and at {{the same}} moment they burst out laughing.|$|E
60|$|Laverick {{turned toward}} Zoe. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> and he read their message of terror.|$|E
60|$|Her clear firm tones {{had their}} effect on him; he looked up. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She could {{scarcely}} move her head for pain and heaviness, {{her eyes were}} strained and sore, {{and she was very}} weak. A curious passive inattention had such possession of her, that the presence of her little sister in the room did not attract her notice for some time. Even when <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>met,</b> and her sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at her in silence, and suffering her timidly to hold her passive hand, before she asked: ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the success}} of The Love of Siam, the {{chemistry}} between Mew, played by Witwisit Hiranyawongkul and Tong, played by Maurer, has been an issue and a trending topic. Hiranyawongkul has told reporters that he and Maurer are just good friends, and credited the film's editing for their seeming chemistry on-screen: [...] "Usually, when having dialogue in the movie, we were facing different cameras." [...] On the set, <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> usually <b>met</b> the film crews', who helped make sure they acted with the right expressions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{there is}} the parson, Doctor Chrysostom. He's a gentleman, at any rate.' At this Mrs. Ponto looked at Miss Wirt. After <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>met</b> and they had wagged their heads at each other. They looked up to the ceiling. So did the young ladies. They thrilled. It was evident I had said {{something}} terrible. Another black sheep in the Church? thought I with a little sorrow; for I don't care to own that I have a respect for the cloth. 'I--hope there's nothing wrong? ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met,</b> Jonas retreated a few paces, and Montague sprang out of bed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> for a moment, and a spot {{of color}} burned in her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> for a moment. Then {{he looked}} away. He {{would say no}} more.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{that he has}} done, [...] His {{mind that}} is fire, [...] His body that is sun, [...] Have set my head higher [...] Than all the world's wives. [...] Himself on the wind [...] Is the gift that he gives, [...] Therefore womenkind, [...] When <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> have <b>met</b> mine, [...] Grow cold and grow hot, [...] Troubled as with wine [...] By a secret thought, [...] Preyed upon, fed upon [...] By jealousy and desire. [...] I am moon to that sun, [...] I am steel to that fire, ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} for your disappointment,' he continued, glancing into her face. <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> having <b>met,</b> became, as it were, {{mutually}} locked together, {{and the single}} instant only which good breeding allows as the length of such a look, became trebled: a clear penetrating ray of intelligence had shot from each into each, giving birth {{to one of those}} unaccountable sensations which carry home to the heart before the hand has been touched or the merest compliment passed, by something stronger than mathematical proof, the conviction, 'A tie has begun to unite us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a full}} {{irony in}} this, on his own part, that he saw her resist the impulse to take up. [...] "I'm {{perfectly}} justified in what I've asked," [...] she quietly returned. [...] "It's doing beautifully for you." [...] <b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> again intimately <b>met,</b> and the effect was to make her proceed. [...] "You're not a bit unhappy." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> in {{a hostile}} glare. The flush on the little man's face deepened.|$|E
60|$|<b>Their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> {{in a long}} gaze, {{and then}} their hands in a close clasp.|$|E
60|$|He raised himself {{upon his}} knees, {{and for a}} moment <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> for the last time.|$|E
6000|$|So strangely and so sweetly. All the ruin, [...] All, {{all their}} handiwork is blown away [...] As though the {{mountain}} air had blown it away [...] Because <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> have <b>met.</b> They cannot hear, [...] Being folded up and hidden in their dance. [...] The dance is changing now. They have dropped <b>their</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] They have covered up <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> as though <b>their</b> hearts [...] Had suddenly been broken--never, never [...] Shall Dermot and Dervorgilla be forgiven. [...] They have drifted {{in the dance}} from rock to rock. [...] They have raised their hands as though to snatch the sleep [...] That lingers always in the abyss of the sky [...] Though they can never reach it. A cloud floats up [...] And covers all the mountain head in a moment. [...] And now it lifts and they are swept away. [...] I had almost yielded and forgiven it all-- [...] This is indeed a place of terrible temptation.|$|R
60|$|And {{there he}} stopped, for {{he saw the}} working of her face. Otherwise they hardly spoke of their loss even to one another. It went down deeper than they could bear to utter, and <b>their</b> hearts and <b>eyes</b> <b>met</b> if <b>their</b> lips did not. Only Lord Northmoor lay too dejected to make the steps {{expected}} in the recovery of strength {{for a few days}} after the grievous revelation, and on the day when at last he was placed on a couch by the window, his wife collapsed, and, almost unconscious, was carried to her bed.|$|R
60|$|Between Eve and her parent, {{there had}} always existed a {{confidence}} exceeding that {{which it is}} common to find between father and daughter. In one sense, they had been all in all to each other, and Eve had never hesitated about pouring those feelings into his breast, which, had she possessed another parent, would more naturally have been confided to the affection of a mother. When <b>their</b> <b>eyes</b> first <b>met,</b> therefore, they were mutually beaming with an expression of confidence and love, such as might, in a measure, have been expected between two of the gentler sex. Mr Effingham folded his child to his heart, pressed her there tenderly for near a minute in silence, and then kissing her burning cheek he permitted her to look up.|$|R
