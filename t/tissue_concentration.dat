In the present study, we examined the possible effects of Zn exposure on the bioaccumulation of Cd and Cu in three populations of the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. We found that Zn exposure significantly enhanced the <b>tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cd and Cu in all populations, and the <b>tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cd and Cu were highly and positively related to the <b>tissue</b> Zn <b>concentration.</b> Furthermore, the enhanced bioaccumulation of Cd and Cu resulted mainly from their increasing accumulation and distribution in two subcellular fractions (i. e., metallothionein-like proteins and metal-rich granules). <b>Tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cd and Cu in the natural Zn-contaminated oysters also covaried with <b>tissue</b> Zn <b>concentration,</b> and prediction analyses revealed that Zn exposure was a significant contributor to tissue Cd and Cu concentrations. Therefore, we concluded that the increased Zn bioavailability in ambient waters not only increased the <b>tissue</b> Zn <b>concentration</b> but also enhanced the overall bioaccumulation of Cd and Cu. This study strongly demonstrates that contamination of metals in oysters may result from concurrent exposure to other metals. Thus, environmental managers should consider the possible exposure to other metals such as Zn in order to interpret/predict the <b>tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> of toxic metals in oysters...|$|R

Patients received a single 500 -mg dose intravenously before surgery. Plasma and <b>tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> of meropenem were highest at ∼ 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated.

Examining tissue residues of these contaminants in biota is basic to ecotoxicology, both for understanding the movement of contaminants within organisms and through food chains, and for understanding and quantifying injuries to organisms and their communities. This book provides guidance on interpreting <b>tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> of environmental contaminants. <b>Tissue</b> <b>concentrations</b> have long been used both to identify the cause of toxicity in animals and as a measure of the severity of toxicity.
