5|$|The Intelligence Support Activity (ISA, <b>The</b> <b>Activity)</b> <b>is</b> {{the support}} branch of JSOC and USSOCOM. Its primary {{missions}} are to provide Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) mainly for Delta and DEVGRU's operations. Before the establishing of the Strategic Support Branch in 2001, the ISA required {{the permission of}} the CIA to conduct covert operations, which considerably lessened its effectiveness in its support of JSOC operations as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf have been actively monitoring the seismicity there since the 1980s and {{have found a}} consistent low level of activity, but a primary characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> that there are multiple sequences of earthquake swarms. Three swarm events, beginning {{in the north and}} ending in the south gulf, have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1,000 events occurred over a three-month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat Deep (in the northern gulf) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale. A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4.3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the Arogonese Deep. The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern Arogonese Deep (in the southern gulf) with the highest magnitude of 6.1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of hare coursing across the different {{states of the}} USA is not always clear. Animal Place, a California-based animal rights group which opposes coursing, claims that <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> legal in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming but illegal in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin. The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field coursing is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. Washington state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} <b>the</b> {{speaking}} <b>activities</b> with Japanese students which are {{offered to the}} learners in the beginners' level of the Japanese Language Course. First, the Japanese language program of Kanazawa University is described then the outline and objectives of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>are</b> listed. These are followed by {{an explanation of the}} practical procedures for <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> in each class. Finally, the results of <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> given. To determine this outcome, observation by Japanese language instructors, comments from the Japanese students and results from a questionnaire given to the Japanese language students were analyzed. The outcome revealed that <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> valuable for improving the Japanese language skills of Japanese language learners. The results also found that <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> instrumental in improving the communication skills of the Japanese students and cultivating their interest in intercultural exchange...|$|R

25|$|This sexual {{practice}} is variously called asphyxiophilia, autoerotic asphyxia, hypoxyphilia. The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when {{the act is}} done by a person to themselves. Colloquially, a person engaging in <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called a gasper.|$|E

25|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysts}} for hydrogenation {{are more}} common industrially. As in homogeneous catalysts, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal, i.e. the coordination sphere. Different faces of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities, for example. Similarly, heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports, i.e. the material upon with the heterogeneous catalyst is bound.|$|E
25|$|Small, M-class stars (with 0.1–0.6 solar masses) that exhibit rapid, {{irregular}} variability {{are known}} as flare stars. These fluctuations are hypothesized {{to be caused by}} flares, although <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> much stronger relative {{to the size of the}} star. The flares on this class of stars can extend up to 20% of the circumference, and radiate much of their energy in the blue and ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs {{carefully}} in paper {{and put them}} into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> not dissipated. The container must not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E

The United States national bandy team has taken part in the Bandy World Championships since 1985 and is also regularly playing friendlies against Canada.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of fox hunting {{claim that}} <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> not {{necessary}} for fox control, arguing that the fox is not a pest species and that hunting does not and cannot {{make a real difference}} to fox populations. They compare the number of foxes killed in the hunt to the many more killed on the roads. They also argue that wildlife management goals of the hunt can be met more effectively by other methods such as lamping (dazzling a fox with a bright light, then shooting by a competent shooter using an appropriate weapon and load).|$|E
25|$|There are divers {{who enjoy}} {{specific}} underwater activities but {{are unable to}} find anyone who shares the specific interest sufficiently to dive with them, and where <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> incompatible with a less than dedicated buddy. The option of simply not diving is not a practical solution, as the diver is then almost permanently prevented from pursuing the interest. Diving with buddies who get bored or tired quickly also {{does not lead to}} enhanced enjoyment for either party. When the underwater activity is of interest only to one person, diving solo is the only option that allows the activity to be undertaken.|$|E

25|$|Early {{papers on}} {{geosynthetics}} (as {{we know them}} today) in the 1960s documented their use as filters in the United States and as reinforcement in Europe. A 1977 conference in Paris brought together many of the early manufacturers and practitioners. The International Geosynthetics Society (IGS) founded in 1982 has subsequently organized a worldwide conference every four years and its numerous chapters have additional conferences. Presently, separate geosynthetic institutes, trade-groups, and standards-setting groups are active. Approximately twenty universities teach stand-alone courses on geosynthetics and almost all include the subject in geotechnical, geoenvironmental, and hydraulic engineering courses. Geosynthetics are available worldwide and <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> robust and steadily growing.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, {{the court}} held that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to {{regulate}} non-commercial activities. In these cases, Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. Subsequently, in Gonzales v. Raich, the court interpreted the Interstate Commerce Clause combined with the Necessary and Proper Clause to empower the federal government to arrest, prosecute, and imprison patients who used marijuana grown at home for medicinal purposes, even where <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> legal in that particular state. Thomas dissented in Raich, again arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause.|$|E
25|$|The West Side {{continues}} to be home to third and fourth-generation Mexican immigrants, as well as 21st-century first-generation Mexican immigrants. The Neighborhood House {{continues to}} serve the needs on {{the residents of the}} lower West Side. Since the lock and dam system on the Upper Mississippi River was completed in the 1950s, flooding on the West Side flats has become a rarity, and quality housing for low- and middle-income families has been built there. Much of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> now geared toward preserving Mexican traditions, with programs to celebrate music, ballet, and history of the Mexican immigrants in Saint Paul.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> illegal but often overlooked by the miners. [...] Lat brings the result of his labour back to his father, expecting praise. [...] Instead, he is punished for neglecting his studies and future. [...] After overhearing his parents' laments and being shown the family's rubber plantation, Lat finds the will to push himself to study. [...] He is rewarded for his efforts, passing a [...] "special examination" [...] and qualifying for a [...] "high-standard" [...] boarding school in Ipoh, the state capital.|$|E
500|$|The {{time and}} {{duration}} of <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> also taken into account when determining unreasonableness. Activities may be reasonable at one time but not at another; in Halsey v Esso Petroleum, filling oil tankers at 10am was held to be reasonable, but the same activity undertaken at 10pm was unreasonable. A private nuisance is normally a [...] "continuing state of affairs", not a one-off situation; there are exceptions, such as in De Keyser's Royal Hotel v Spicer, where piledriving at night was considered a nuisance. In such situations, the normal remedy is to grant an injunction limiting {{the time of the}} activity. Another exception was found in British Celanese v AH Hunt Ltd, where an electronics company stored foil strips on their property which blew onto adjoining land, causing the power supply to a nearby yarn manufacturers to be cut off. A similar incident had occurred 3 years earlier and the defendants had been warned to store their strips properly; it was held that even though the power cut was a one-off event, the method of storing the foil strips constituted a continuing state of affairs, and the defendants were liable.|$|E
