5|$|Before {{leaving the}} Army, Buckner helped {{an old friend}} from West Point and the Mexican–American War, Captain Ulysses S. Grant, by {{covering}} his expenses at a New York hotel until money arrived from Ohio {{to pay for his}} passage home. On March 26, 1855, Buckner resigned from the Army to work with his father-in-law, who had extensive real estate holdings in Chicago, Illinois. When his father-in-law died in 1856, Buckner inherited his property and moved to Chicago <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> <b>it</b> himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E

5|$|Bolstered {{by some of}} his successes, in 1940 Narayan {{tried his}} hand at a journal, Indian Thought. With {{the help of his}} uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a {{thousand}} subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan's inability <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> <b>it,</b> and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, Malgudi Days, was published in November 1942, followed by The English Teacher in 1945. In between, being cut off from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan's books started selling well and in 1948 he started building his own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the screenplay for the Gemini Studios film Miss Malini (1947), which remained the only screenplay by him that was successfully adapted into a feature film.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} weaving of fine kersies and later serges was {{introduced}} to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the fleeces would be combed and sorted. John Lane {{was one of the best}} known local cloth merchants (see Lane's Aisle in the section on St Andrew's church below). In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King's Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and 'many spinners'. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and worsted cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. <b>To</b> <b>manage</b> <b>it</b> she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts. Later the business evolved into machine knitted garments.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} how the senior management of two banks, Banco Comercial Português (BCP) and Continental Bank have each chosen to align information technology (IT) with their businesses. While BCP <b>manages</b> <b>IT</b> in-house, Continental Bank has chosen a very different route - it became the first major bank to completely outsource all of its IT in 1992. Despite their apparently diametrically opposed approaches <b>to</b> <b>managing</b> <b>IT,</b> both banks face the problem of effectively linking IT to their business strategies. This paper describes the particular approach used by each bank for aligning IT with its business and draws some general conclusions from a comparative analysis of their experiences. ...|$|R
