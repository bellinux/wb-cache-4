The experimental strain data obtained with the hole drilling technique is converted into meaningful residual stresses in the inelastic range. The hole drilling technique (ASTM Standard Test Method E 837) is the most simple and reliable methodology to predict the residual stresses in the structures and components. But this method in the present form {{can be used to}} predict the residual stresses within the elastic range. The inherent assumption of constant stress field around the hole in the standard ASTM method is present in this case also, but this limitation can be overcome with more data on variation of the strain field near the narrow gap weld zone and refined analysis is possible. ANN database is generated with the help of non-linear finite element analysis by numerically simulating the hole drilling operation for various magnitudes of residual stresses with a range of biaxiality ratios. For the present problem 1 / 16 ” hole diameter with a gauge length of 1 / 8 ” around the hole is used to sense the numerical strain field around the hole. The gauge location is at r/a = 3. 08, where r is the distance of hole center to gauge mid point and a is the hole radius [1]. This analysis approach assumes that stress field is constant for a small region of strain gauge (~ 3 mm) as has also been used in the residual stress estimation in the standard ASTM method. Further, this database after network training is used to analyze measured strain data on a 6 -inch diameter welded pipe. The ANN predictions are reconfirmed with non-linear finite element analysis.

A key factor to a successful foam cement job is an optimized cement slurry design. To achieve optimal slurry design the project engineer is working in close collaboration with the onshore cement laboratory. In laboratory testing, the foam stability is an important factor. In recent years it is claimed that the foam stability results from the cement laboratory seems not to fully match with the actual results in the field.

It is customary to install the throttles in joints of pipelines (in teejoints and cross <b>tees)</b> or in <b>joints</b> of pipelines with pneumatic automation devices Presently, in designing the pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones a gas mass flow through a throttle is calculated by a known equation derived from the Saint-Venant-Vantсel formula for the adiabatic flow of ideal gas through a nozzle from an unrestrictedly high capacity tank. Neglect of gas velocity at the throttle inlet {{is one of the}} assumptions taken {{in the development of the}} above equation. As may be seen in practice, in actual systems the diameters of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted can be commensurable. Neglect of the inlet velocity therewith can result in an error when determining the required throttle diameter in design calculation and a flow rate in checking calculation, as well as when measuring a flow rate in the course of the test. The theoretical study has revealed that the flow velocity at the throttle inlet is responsible for two parameter values: the outlet flow velocity and the critical pressure ratio, which in turn determine the gas mass flow value. To calculate the gas mass flow, the dependencies are given in the paper, which allow taking into account the flow rate at the throttle inlet. The analysis of obtained dependencies has revealed that the degree of influence of inlet flow rate upon the mass flow is defined by two parameters: pressure ratio at the throttle and open area ratio of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted. An analytical investigation has been pursued to evaluate the extent to which the gas mass flow through the throttle is affected by the inlet flow rate. The findings of the investigation and the indications for using the present dependencies are given in this paper.

40|$|Dealing {{with steel}} moment {{resisting}} frames (MRFs), {{the latest version}} of Eurocode 8 allows us to dissipate the seismic input energy in connections provided that their characteristics under cyclic loads are certified by means of experimental testing. Within the beam-to-column joint typologies to be used in seismic resistant steel frames, the double split <b>tee</b> <b>joint</b> (DST) represents an interesting solution due to its easy fabrication and repair after a destructive seismic event. Nevertheless, the cyclic behavior of this joint typology is usually characterized by pinching and strength degradation phenomena due to the plastic engagement of the rectangular T-stubs which compromises the use of DST joints as dissipative elements. Within this framework, in this paper, in order to improve the hysteretic behavior of this connection typology, a new type of dissipative DST joint is presented. In particular, the proposed dissipative T-stub is designed substituting the rectangular T-stubs with the so-called Xshaped T-stubs, whose flange plates are cut into an hourglass shape similar to that of ADAS dampers. In particular, in the paper, a model that is able to predict the resistance of the proposed X-shaped T-stubs accounting for moment–shear interaction is developed and rules for designing the optimum shape of dissipative DST joints are proposed. Finally, the results of an experimental activity on real scale joints are presented aiming to verify the reliability of the proposed design approach and to compare the cyclic behavior of classical and X-shaped DST joints evidencing the benefits provided by the proposed dissipative joint...|$|E

A review of existing flow loops worldwide revealed that specialized areas of research such as liquid loading in gas wells are still lacking dedicated test facilities. This project presents the design of a new dedicated facility to be located at the TowerLab at the Richardson building with adequate operating conditions to reproduce the flow regimes encountered prior to and after the onset of liquid loading in gas wells. The facility consists of a compressed air system, pipelines for air and water, a pressure vessel containing glass beads, an injection manifold, and flow control and monitoring devices. Our results show that three compressors working in parallel is the most technical and economic configuration for the TowerLab based on the overall costs provided by the supplier, the footprint but most importantly the flexibility. The design of the pressure vessel required a cylindrical body with top and bottom welded-flat head covers with multiple openings to minimize its weight.

30|$|The risers are {{generally}} connected {{at right angles}} to the manifold, thus forming a <b>tee</b> <b>joint</b> at each connection which leads to local disturbances. A varying local pressure drop for a flow through such a manifold results in an uneven flow distribution through the whole collector. Wang and Yu[5] developed a numerical model to calculate the isothermal flow distribution using mass and momentum equations at each branch of the header system. Wang and Wu[6] proposed a discrete numerical model and demonstrated the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector for U- and Z-configurations by taking into account the effects of buoyancy and longitudinal heat conduction. Jones and Lior[7] developed a discrete hydrodynamic model, and the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations were solved numerically. For negligible buoyancy effects, they investigated the effects of geometrical parameters of the collector such as the ratio of riser to manifold diameter, number of risers, and length of risers on the flow nonuniformity. Fan et al.[4] carried out CFD calculations to estimate the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector consisting of 16 risers connected in U-configuration, having a tilt of 40 °. The influences of flow rate, fluid properties, collector tilt, and collector inlet fluid temperature were investigated. Later, for the same collector, Fan and Furbo[8] studied the buoyancy effects on fluid and temperature distribution by means of CFD calculations. They found that at a certain low flow rate, buoyancy effects are of the same order as the pressure drop in the risers or even larger, which results in a more nonuniform flow distribution. The pattern of flow distribution reverses as compared to the case of high flow rate (25 l/min) with negligible buoyancy effects. Glembin et al.[2] experimentally investigated the flow distribution in a horizontally placed coaxial vacuum tube solar collector consisting of 60 parallel vacuum tubes connected in U-configuration. They adopted a procedure where flow distribution was calculated from the measured tube outlet temperatures for a range of inlet temperatures and mass flow rates.|$|E
40|$|Although {{industrial}} piping {{systems and}} their components {{have been found}} highly vulnerable under earthquake events, there exists an inadequacy of proper seismic analysis and design rules for these structures. Current seismic design Standards and Codes {{are found to be}} over-conservative and some components, e. g., elbows, bolted flange joints and Tee joints, do not have detailed design guidelines that take into account earthquake loading. Thus, a clear need for the development of improved seismic design rules for such systems is evident. In this respect, numerical and experimental studies on piping systems and their components subjected to earthquake loading could be useful. As a result, valuable information, such as seismic capacities and demands under different limit states, could be utilized for the amendment of relevant design Codes and Standards. This thesis undertook a numerical and experimental investigation on a typical industrial piping system and some of its components in order to assess their seismic performance. In particular, the following issues have been pursued: (i) design of two non-standard Bolted Flange Joints (BFJs) suitable for seismic applications; (ii) experimental testing of the designed BFJs under monotonic and cyclic loading in order to check their leakage, bending and axial capacities; (iii) finite element analysis of a piping system containing several critical components under seismic loading; (iv) implementation of a pseudo-dynamic and real time testing schemes to test the piping system under seismic loading; and (v) pseudo-dynamic and real time tests on the piping system under several levels of earthquake loading corresponding to both serviceability and ultimate limit states. The above-mentioned activities were attained in this thesis. In particular, two different non-standard BFJs, comparatively thinner than the Standard ones, were designed, and their performance was examined through a number of monotonic and cyclic tests. Experimental results exhibited a favourable performance of the BFJs under bending and axial loading and moderate internal pressure; a good capacity in terms of strength, ductility, energy dissipation and leakage was observed. Performance of a typical full-scale industrial piping system containing several critical components, such as elbows, a bolted flange joint and a <b>Tee</b> <b>joint,</b> under realistic seismic loading was investigated through extensive numerical and experimental activities. The techniques of pseudo-dynamic and real time testing with dynamic substructuring –hybrid testing- were adopted to carry out experimental activities on the piping system under several limit state earthquake loading suggested by performance-based earthquake Standards. Implementations of hybrid tests were challenging mainly because the piping system was endowed with distributed masses and subjected to distributed earthquake forces, for which these experimental techniques have been considered inadequate so far. A number of mode synthesis techniques, namely the Craig-Bampton and SEREP methods, were discussed and their effectiveness was analysed for the realization of these tests. A characterization of the actuators {{to be used in the}} experimental tests was performed based on a transfer function. Relevant hybrid tests were successfully executed and they displayed a favourable performance of the piping system and its components; they remained below yield limits without any leakage even for the collapse limit state...|$|E

In past, the application of dampers has been widely investigated within the development of supplemental energy dissipation strategies, with the aim to improve the energy dissipation capacity of the primary structure and to reduce the structural damage by concentrating the energy dissipation supply in fuses located in zones of the structure where high relative displacements are expected. Conversely, the strategy studied in the FREEDAM project is based on the application of damping devices, specifically friction dampers, under a new perspective. In fact, they are conceived as elements included in connections with the aim to completely substitute the traditional dissipative zones of MRFs, i. e. the beam ends. To this scope, beam-to-column joints are equipped with friction dampers constituted by steel plates and friction pads pre-loaded with high-strength bolts, that can be located either at the level of both flanges, or at the bottom flange level only, or on additional haunches which can be used to increase the lever arm of the damper. In particular, the connection studied in the FREEDAM project is realized as a modification of the classical detail of a Double Split <b>Tee</b> <b>Joint</b> (DST) where, in substitution of the bottom Tee element, a symmetrical friction damper is introduced which is realized pre-loading friction pads located between the webs of a couple of angles used to fasten the beam to the column and the beam flange or the lowev plate of an eventual beam hunch, which is slotted in order to allow the sliding of the damper. With this connecting system, under bending actions, the joint is forced to rotate around a rotation center located at the base of the upper T-stub web and the energy dissipation supply is provided by the alternate slippage of the lower beam flange on friction pads. In this way, provided that the steel components of the connection are properly over-strengthened, the joint resistance and the rotation capacity can be easily governed by calibrating the preload applied to the frictional interfaces and realizing slotted holes whose length provides an adequate stroke for the dissipative device. The main feature of this connection is that, even under the occurrence of destructive seismic events, the only damage is due to the consumption of the friction pads, while all the steel elements are completely preserved obtaining, in this way, a connection able to withstand destructive seismic events without any damage to the steel parts, namely a FREE from DAMage connection. Clearly, in order to accurately control the design of such a connection typology, the knowledge of the value of the friction coefficient of the material employed to realize the friction pads is of paramount importance. Therefore, among all the possible materials, it is necessary to select those able to develop high values of the friction coefficient and a stable behavior under cyclic loading conditions. In this paper, the main results of preliminary analyses devoted to select the best materials to be employed as friction pads in the FREEDAM connections are presented. To date, twelve tests on eight different materials combined with stainless steel plates have been realized. The tests performed, mainly devoted to evaluate the behavior of the friction interfaces in terms of static and kinetic friction coefficient and in terms of degradation, are inspired to the sliding test proposed by EN 1090 - 2 adopting the loading protocol suggested by the EN 12159 for the qualification of seismic devices. The initial value of the friction coefficient and its evolution during the tests, have been determined for the different materials by monitoring the values of the forces of the bolts used to apply the pre-load to the friction interface and the value of the sliding force. The obtained results are presented both in terms of force-displacement curves and in terms of friction coefficient, providing a comparison between the performances of the analyzed interfaces in terms of energy dissipation supply...|$|E
