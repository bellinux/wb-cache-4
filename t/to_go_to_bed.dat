25|$|After {{many years}} of being held on Mondays at 9:00pm Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30pm Eastern/5:30pm Pacific. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> earlier. For many years the film {{industry}} had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office. The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, {{to the point where}} some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January or early-February ceremony held on a Sunday would have to compete with National Football League playoff games such as the Super Bowl.|$|E

25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E

500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he would like you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably {{different from the rest of}} the album.|$|E
500|$|In an October 1974 radio {{interview}} with Alan Freeman, Harrison recalled writing [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] while preparing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and mentioned it as a composition {{that had come}} easily to him. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison states that his inspiration for the song was [...] "Japa Yoga meditation", whereby mantras are sung and counted out on prayer beads. Musically, the composition has elements of gospel and rock music; Leng describes it as [...] "gospel-drenched" [...] and cites Harrison's production of [...] "Sing One for the Lord", which Preston recorded with the Edwin Hawkins Singers in early 1970, as a [...] "catalyst" [...] for the new composition. The song opens with a descending guitar riff, later repeated after each chorus, which ends on the melody's root chord of B major.|$|E

500|$|Plans {{called for}} a first {{appearance}} at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who {{was director of the}} Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas {{for the first time since}} their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he [...] "looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self". Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with her. Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.|$|E
500|$|The book {{proved to}} be popular enough to be printed in two more editions and in 1796 Rückerschöld's first genuine {{cookbook}} was published, Den Nya och Fullständiga Kok-Boken ("The New and Complete Cookbook"). It was far larger than her previous work, over 300 pages, and included recipes for more refined dishes. Nevertheless, Rückerschöld tried to hold fast to her frugal ideals. In the foreword to the book, she described Cajsa Wargs cookbook as being too extravagant, though this is partially excused because {{it was written in}} a time of more abundance and by an author used to the lavish resources of a wealthy kitchen. In the book Rückerschöld continued to promote her goal that all women should be skilled homemakers and cooks; without such knowledge, they {{would not be able to}} fulfill their duties as women. Other than recommendations in the foreword, the book also contained a short chapter with descriptions of fictitious housewives that served as warning examples about neglecting housework in favor of beautification, reading, religion, or doing the chores of the servants. The ideal housewife is embodied only by the final example, Beningnia. By being humble, studious and knowledgeable, and being first to rise and last <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> she becomes [...] "the pride of her husband, pinnacle of the household, joy of servants, delight of friends, assuager of the poor, solace of the inconsolable, haven of the oppressed, and, finally, the envy of mean-spirited neighbors".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene of Act 2, Fleance meets his father, who asks him to take his sword and tells him he is {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> due to the [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, however, Banquo demands the sword be returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king. Doing so would make the throne more available for Fleance, and would fulfill the Three Witches' prophecy that his sons would become kings. Since Banquo's good nature is revolted by these thoughts, he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance {{to be sure he}} does not act on them. Still, he is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands their return. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams {{have nothing to do with}} him killing the king, but that they have revealed to him Macbeth's bloody nature. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night, but when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had these dark dreams about Macbeth, takes back his sword as a precaution. In any case, this scene adds to the dark, uncertain, unsettling tone of the play. Fleance and his father are not even certain of what time it is throughout, as Fleance says when asked at the beginning of the scene [...] "The moon is down; I have not heard the clock." ...|$|E

500|$|No one {{doubted that}} Lim, Tan, and Hoe {{had killed the}} children. [...] Their defence was based on convincing the judges that medically, the accused were not in total control of {{themselves}} during the crimes. [...] The bulk of the trial was therefore a battle between expert witnesses called by both sides. [...] Dr Wong Yip Chong, a senior psychiatrist in private practice, believed that Lim was mentally ill {{at the time of}} the crimes. [...] Claiming to be [...] "judging by the big picture, and not fussing over contradictions", he said that Lim's voracious sexual appetite and deluded belief in Kali were characteristics of a mild manic depression. [...] The doctor also said that only an unsound mind would dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police. [...] In rebuttal, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, said that Lim was [...] "purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure". [...] In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a [...] medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with him. [...] Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional. [...] Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control. [...] Lastly, Lim had consulted doctors and freely taken sedatives to alleviate his insomnia, a condition which, according to Dr Chee, sufferers from manic depression fail to recognise.|$|E
