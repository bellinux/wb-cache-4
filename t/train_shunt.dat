From 1952, the higher powered EW class locomotives were the preferred locomotive for use on passenger trains and for use on this line because of the gradients and curves.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a <b>Train</b> <b>Shunting</b> problem which occurs in cargo train organizations: We have a locomotive travelling along a track segment {{and a collection}} of n cars, where each car has a source and a target. Whenever the train passes the source of a car, it needs {{to be added to the}} train, and on the target, the respective car needs to be removed. Any such operation at the end of the <b>train</b> incurs low <b>shunting</b> cost, but adding or removing truly in the interior requires a more complex shunting operation and thus yields high cost. The objective is to schedule the adding and removal of cars as to minimize the total cost. This problem can also be seen as a relaxed version of the well-known List Update problem, which may be of independent interest. We derive polynomial time algorithms for <b>Train</b> <b>Shunting</b> by reducing this problem to finding independent sets in bipartite graphs. This allows us to treat several variants of the problem in a generic way. Specifically, we obtain an algorithm with running time O(n^{ 5 / 2 }) for the uniform case, where all low costs and all high costs are identical, respectively. Furthermore, for the non-uniform case we have running time of O(n^ 3). Both versions translate to a symmetric variant, where it is also allowed to add and remove cars at the front of the train at low cost. In addition, we formulate a dynamic program with running time O(n^ 4), which exploits the special structure of the graph. Although the running time is worse, it allows us to solve many extensions, e. g., prize-collection, economies of scale, and dependencies between consecutive stations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Train</b> <b>shunting</b> {{planning}} for the Netherlands Railways is a complex planning problem that is performed by about 130 full-time planners. It concerns the planning of day-to-day shunting operations at the large stations in the railway network. In our study, the central question is: how can the planners be supported in their task with an advanced planning system? In contrast with the traditional way to design a scheduling support system, we based our system on an extensive task analysis. We describe {{the results of the}} task analysis, the design paradigm of task-oriented scheduling algorithms, and the resulting prototype. 1...|$|R

Especially during the night, the trains have to be parked in a shunting depot {{in such a way that}} the operations in the next morning can start as smoothly as possible. The general problem is very difficult and includes many subproblems. We focus on the following subproblem: how to arrange the trains in a “correct” order on the available tracks by avoiding shunting operations for outgoing trains of the morning. We discuss different cases of the problem, and we propose both algorithmic solutions and heuristic approaches...|$|R
