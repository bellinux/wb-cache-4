Figure  2 shows the maximum temperature recorded near the coring shoe (Tmax) and hydrate/gas phase boundary temperature (Tf) in Holes C 0008 A and C 0008 C. In some cases, the maximum temperature exceeded that of gas hydrate stability, which could have led to hydrate dissociation. However, this only means that the frictional heat energy is converted into gas internal energy. When all the excess heat is used up, the dissociation process simply stops, and further dissociation, leading to {{a decrease in the}} formation temperature from its original state, will never occur. If, on the other hand, no excess heat is used for hydrate dissociation, the temperature decay curve follows that of ordinary sediments. Thus, there is also no reason for excess heat to remain around the sensor, leading to a temperature increase. This is supported by the absence of correlation between Tmax and the residual temperature curves in Figure  2.|$|E

In contrast to this, 8 -MOP accumulated in the lower corium and subcutis and reached concentrations higher then those found in the upper corium and epidermis. This accumulation of the drug is a consequence of the in vitro conditions and its amount is proportional to that amount that under in vivo conditions would have been taken up by the capillary system. Penetration was dependent on vehicle characteristics and was found to increase with increasing polarity of the vehicle.

The cervical spine is the most complicated articular system in the body. The pedicles of the cervical spine are short and thick and become the most critical part during the screw insertion process.

Disturbances applied for short duration get decayed before they could reach the thermocline, whereas medium and long duration disturbances evolve into a ``falling spike'' or ``stalactite-like'' structure and destabilize the thermocline. Rayleigh Taylor instability is observed inside the storage tank. The effect of the duration, velocity and temperature of the disturbance on thermocline thickness and penetration length are studied.

This flow of gases is driven by pressure differences, which are in turn caused by heating by the spent fuel. In this analysis, the timing and size of holes in the containers are assumed to be given. A better means of predicting the time distribution and sizes of penetrations in nuclear waste containers is needed. For the purposes of far-field transport calculations, we have adopted release rates that are shown to be bonding for the large range of hole sizes studied. The transport of released {sup 14 }CO{sub 2 } has been analyzed by transport in equivalent porous medium. The peak {sup 14 }CO{sub 2 } concentration in pore gas at 350 m above the repository does not depend on the time of hole occurrence, although the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> obviously affects the arrival and duration of exposure to {sup 14 }C.

Despite a long line of Victorian Court of Appeal decisions which have reaffirmed the Morgan principle, the court has construed s. 37 AA(b) (ii) of the Act as leaving open the possibility of an acquittal {{despite the fact that the}} accused acted with an awareness that one or more factors that are statutorily deemed as negating consent under s. 36 (a) -(g) of the Act were operating at the time of his or her sexual penetration; specifically, the court held that the foregoing factors do not necessarily preclude a jury from finding that the accused acted in the genuine belief that the complainant was consenting.

ValentThe hemibiotrophic {{rice blast}} fungus Magnaporthe oryzae {{undergoes}} complex morphological development throughout its infection cycle. From 8 - 20 {{hours after a}} fungal spore lands on a leaf surface, the fungus differentiates a complex appressorium that punctures the host cuticle. By ~ 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), the fungus grows inside an epidermal cell as a primary hypha, and by 36 hpi the fungus has differentiated specialized biotrophic invasive hyphae (IH) that are filling the first-invaded cell and moving into neighbor cells. Throughout its life cycle, IH invade living rice cells although invaded cells appear dead when the fungus moves into the next cell. Biotrophic invasion must be mediated by fungal effectors, proteins that pathogens secrete inside live host cells to control them. However, {{little is known about}} blast effectors, and the low fungal biomass in early infection stages complicates identification of effector genes, as well as identification of rice genes controlled by effectors. The characterized AVR-Pita effector gene is specifically expressed in planta, but it was not clear how its gene expression pattern changed in different infection stages. We found that AVR-Pita is first expressed around the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration.</b> AVR-Pita is highly expressed in IH developing in asymptomatic tissue from 36 hpi to as late as 7 days post inoculation when lesions are maturing. Using inoculated rice sheaths, we successfully enriched for infected tissue RNA that contained ~ 20 % IH RNA at 36 hpi. We compared IH gene expression to expression in mycelium from pure culture using a whole-genome M. oryzae oligoarray, and we compared infected rice gene expression to expression in mock-inoculated tissue using a rice oligoarray. Rice genes that were induced > 50 -fold during infection were enriched for genes involved in transferring information from sensors to cellular responses. Fungal genes that were induced > 50 -fold in IH included known effectors and many IH-specific genes encoding hypothetical secreted proteins that are candidate effectors.
