50|$|Chloroxylenol is not {{significantly}} <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans, is practically non-toxic to birds, and is moderately <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> freshwater invertebrates. It is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> fish and cats {{and should not}} be used around them. It is a mild skin irritant and may trigger allergic reactions in some individuals.|$|R
5000|$|Chronic (avian reproduction) {{studies show}} no effects {{at the highest}} levels tested in mallards (NOEC) = 1000 ppm) or quail (NOEC = 10 ppm). The {{metabolite}} MB 46136 is more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> the parent than avian species tested (very highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> upland game birds and moderately <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> waterfowl on an acute oral basis).|$|R
50|$|Tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate is also <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> wildlife, {{including}} {{fish and}} aquatic invertebrates. It is also assumed by the Environmental Protection Agency <b>to</b> be <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> birds.|$|R
5000|$|Acute {{studies of}} estuarine animals using oysters, mysids, and {{sheepshead}} minnows show that fipronil is highly acutely <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> oysters and sheepshead minnows, and very highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mysids. Metabolites MB 46136 and MB 45950 are more toxic than the parent to freshwater invertebrates (MB 46136 is 6.6 times more toxic and MB 45950 is 1.9 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> freshwater invertebrates).|$|R
50|$|Sodium fluoroacetate is <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> all obligate aerobic organisms, {{and highly}} <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mammals and insects. The oral dose of sodium fluoroacetate {{sufficient}} to be lethal in humans is 2-10 mg/kg.|$|R
50|$|Starlicide or gull {{toxicant}} is {{a chemical}} avicide {{that is highly}} <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> European starlings (thus the name) and gulls, but less <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> other birds or to mammals such as humans and pets.|$|R
50|$|Rotenone is {{classified}} by the World Health Organization as moderately hazardous. It is mildly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans and other mammals, but extremely <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> insects and aquatic life, including fish. This higher toxicity in fish and insects {{is because the}} lipophilic rotenone is easily taken up through the gills or trachea, but not as easily through the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. Rotenone is <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> erythrocytes in vitro.|$|R
40|$|Bioassays were {{conducted}} to determine the toxicity of monoterpenoids to the tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi (Rennie), and its honey bee, Apis mellifera L. host. Compounds assayed included one terpene hydrocarbon (d-limonene), one terpene aldehyde (citral), one terpene ketone (pulegone), and four terpene alcohols (carvacrol, menthol, thymol, and α-terpineol). The effects of exposure time, temperature, and humidity were examined for citral and menthol fumigations. ^ In topical application studies, only citral and α-terpineol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Citral was 7. 0, 5. 0, and 3. 5 more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at the LD 10, LD 50, and LD 90, respectively. α-Terpineol was 3. 5 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at the LD 10; however, differences were not significant at the LD 50 or LD 90. In fumigation studies, menthol and citral were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> tracheal mites. Menthol was 52. 0, 18. 8, and 5. 7 times more toxic at the LD 10, LD 50 and LD 90, respectively. Citral was 2. 9 (2. 5 - 3. 3) times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at all concentrations estimated. Thymol and carvacrol were numerically more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites, although the differences were not significant statistically. ^ Menthol exhibited the greatest margin of safety in fumigation studies; however, menthol and thymol were more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honey bees than other monoterpenoids. While menthol toxicity to adult mites was high, toxicity to eggs and larvae was limited. Menthol efficacy was not diminished by high or low humidity; however, bee mortality was reduced when applications were made at high relative humidity. Menthol toxicity to both bees and mites increased at higher temperatures. ^ Citral was the only compound assayed that was more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites than bees in both topical and fumigant application studies. In fumigation studies, citral was highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> all mite life stages. Citral was more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> mites at high temperatures, while bee toxicity increased at lower temperatures. Maximum mite control was achieved eight times faster with citral than menthol in fumigation assays. ...|$|R
50|$|On March 15, 2017 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) {{announced}} recommendations proceeding from a {{risk assesment}} of glyphosate performed by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assesmant (RAC). Their recommendations maintained the current classification of glyphosate {{as a substance}} causing serious eye damage, and as a substance <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> aquatic life. However, the RAC did not find evidence implicating glyphosate to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, as <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> reproduction, nor as <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> specific organs.|$|R
25|$|Auxins are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> {{plants in}} large concentrations; {{they are most}} <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, {{synthetic}} auxin herbicides, including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, have been developed and used for weed control.|$|R

5000|$|An early-lifestage {{toxicity}} {{study in}} rainbow trout found that fipronil affects larval growth with a NOEC of 0.0066 ppm and an LOEC of 0.015 ppm. The metabolite MB 46136 is more toxic than the parent to freshwater fish (6.3 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> rainbow trout and 3.3 times more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> bluegill sunfish). Based on an acute daphnia study using fipronil and three supplemental studies using its metabolites, fipronil is characterized as highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> aquatic invertebrates.|$|R
5|$|Venom that is <b>toxic</b> only <b>to</b> {{a certain}} taxon, or {{strongly}} <b>toxic</b> only <b>to</b> a certain taxon, {{has been found}} in a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity to a certain taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|R
2500|$|Aggressively searching out, removing, and {{destroying}} the brood in infested trees {{is the best}} way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. Carbaryl, permethrin and bifenthrin are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. Carbaryl is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. [...] It is moderately <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> wild birds and partially <b>to</b> highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> aquatic organisms. Permethrin is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by permethrin. [...] Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> beneficial insects. Bifenthrin is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> birds and aquatic ecosystems than permethrin, as well as extremely <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> beneficial insects.|$|R
