500|$|The album's {{title track}} and lead single [...] "Eazy-Duz-It", written by MC Ren, {{opens with a}} woman acclaiming Eazy-E's style. Eazy then {{interrupts}} saying [...] "Bitch shut <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>up,</b> get the fuck outta here." [...] This {{is followed by a}} bass line provided by Dr. Dre. Soon, Eazy begins to rap about himself and things that he does. The song declares that Eazy is a [...] "hardcore villain" [...] who collects money from his prostitutes, and feels great when his [...] "pockets are fat." [...] The chorus, repeated three times, states that he [...] "is a gangsta having fun". The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap, including gunshots, and references to several drugs.|$|E
500|$|On May 12, 2009, Eminem {{released}} his sixth studio effort, Relapse, {{which included a}} song titled [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad".

[...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at his comments. Following Cannon's comments, Eminem responded sarcastically. He clarified that the song was actually [...] "wishing the couple the best", and that it was a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well. He later commented that he respected Cannon for his response, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife.|$|E

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>up,</b> and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

2500|$|A boycott by musicians {{saying they}} would not stage {{performances}} in Arizona was co-founded by Marco Amador, a Chicano activist and independent media advocate and Zack de la Rocha, the lead singer of Rage Against the Machine {{and the son of}} Beto de la Rocha of Chicano art group Los Four, who said, [...] "Some of us grew up dealing with racial profiling, but this law (SB 1070) takes it to a whole new low." [...] Called the Sound Strike, artists signing on with the effort included Kanye West, Cypress Hill, Massive Attack, Conor Oberst, Sonic Youth, Joe Satriani, Rise Against, Tenacious D, The Coup, Gogol Bordello, and Los Tigres del Norte. [...] Some other Spanish-language artists did not join this effort but avoided playing in Arizona on their tours anyway; these included Pitbull, Wisin & Yandel, and Conjunto Primavera. [...] The Sound Strike boycott failed to gain support from many area- or stadium-level acts, and no country music acts signed on. [...] Elton John very publicly opposed such efforts, saying at a concert performance in Tucson: [...] "We are all very pleased to be playing in Arizona. I have read that some of the artists won't come here. They are fuckwits! Let's face it: I still play in California, and as a gay man I have no legal rights whatsoever. So what's <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> <b>up</b> with these people?" [...] By November 2010, Pitbull had announced a change of heart, playing a show in Phoenix because large parts of the law had been stopped by the judicial action. My Chemical Romance, an original Sound Strike participant, supposedly dropped out and scheduled a show in the state as well [...] (however, the following day the show was cancelled and the band apologized, explaining that it was an error with tour scheduling and it should not have been booked in the first place due to [...] "the band's affiliation with The Sound Strike" [...] ). De la Rocha said Sound Strike would continue despite the injunction against large parts of SB1070 in order to battle Arizona's [...] "racist and fear mongering state government" [...] and until the Obama administration stopped participating in federal actions such as the 287(g) program, Secure Communities, and other U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies.|$|E

500|$|The {{album is}} {{primarily}} sample-based and instrumental, as recording and production followed a lo-fi and downtempo aesthetic. Gadget also assisted in vocal production for the album's three vocal tracks, [...] "Organism", [...] "It Gets Heavy" [...] and [...] "Getting It Together". In contrast to Guerrero's previous studio album A Little Bit of Somethin (2000), production for Soul Food Taqueria was more polished, despite Guerrero stating {{that he is}} [...] "still down with <b>the</b> <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> 4 track action" [...] upon the album's release.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} Pelagial is multi-dimensional. [...] The first, most literal, level {{involves}} a {{journey from the}} surface to the lowest depth zone of the ocean, with the album's movements getting progressively darker and more claustrophobic to mimic the diminishing light and increasing atmospheric pressure. [...] However, at a second, allegorical level, the ocean layers serve as an extended metaphor for a journey into the inner depths of the psyche. [...] Guitarist and songwriter Robin Staps described this aspect of Pelagial as a movement [...] "towards the essence and origins of our desires, wishes, dreams, and all <b>the</b> <b>fucked</b> <b>up</b> attributes inside of our own inner selves that generate and shape them" [...] and {{said that there are}} [...] "a lot of Freud-like references" [...] in the lyrics and song titles.|$|R

5000|$|For All <b>the</b> <b>Fucked</b> <b>Up</b> Children is a 1995 {{release from}} the neo-psychedelic trio Spacemen 3. The record {{consists}} of what claims to be Spacemen 3's first ever recording session, from 1984. The music sounds like a primitive version of the group, the dominating sound of the record is a slow, droning psychedelic blues performed with spare instrumentation. A drum set is matched {{with a pair of}} distorted electric guitars, all of which provide a swirling foundation for Jason Pierce's vocals. The album's liner notes is an early review by Gary Boldie, where he contemplates the city of Rugby and finds it an odd source for this new sound, and while he declares Spacemen 3 as the [...] "all singing, all dancing answer to the problems of a grey 1985," [...] he admits they are still raw, a little too repetitive, and need time to blossom.|$|R

2500|$|Despite having played {{fewer than}} ten gigs, Spacemen 3 decided {{to produce a}} demo tape. In 1984 they made their first studio {{recordings}} at the home studio of Dave Sheriff in Rugby. This material – which included early iterations of the songs [...] "Walkin' with Jesus", [...] "Come Down Easy" [...] and [...] "Thing'll Never be the Same" [...] – was used for a short demo tape entitled For All <b>The</b> <b>Fucked</b> <b>Up</b> Children Of <b>The</b> World We Give You Spacemen 3. They got a few hundred cassette copies made and produced their own artwork and booklet to accompany it, selling the tapes for £1 at a local record shop. Spacemen 3's music at this stage had a loose, swampy Blues feel; some songs included harmonica and slide guitar, and their style sounded akin to The Cramps. These early demo recordings, which Kember later recalled as being [...] "really dreadful", would later be released unofficially in 1995 on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label, thus providing an insight into the band's embryonic sound.|$|R
