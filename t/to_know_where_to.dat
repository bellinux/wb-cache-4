5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{or not a}} {{bystander}} intervenes {{may have}} to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs. If the bystander is familiar with the environment, they are more likely <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> get help, where the exits are, etc. Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are not familiar with the surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation.|$|E
25|$|The growing fame of Cayce {{along with}} the {{popularity}} he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities. Even though Cayce was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give his readings, which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful. A cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market; however, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant's offer. Some wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> hunt for treasures while others {{wanted to know the}} outcome of horse races. Several times he was persuaded to give such readings as an experiment. However, when he used his ability for such purposes, he did no better than chance alone would dictate. These experiments allegedly left him depleted of energy, distraught, and unsatisfied with himself. Finally, he decided to use his gift only to help the distressed and sick.|$|E

500|$|The {{many changes}} of captain {{over the summer}} {{reflected}} uncertainty in the English cricketing establishment {{as to how to}} respond to the drubbing the team was receiving from the West Indies; the selectors [...] "did not seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> turn, either for a new captain or for a settled team".|$|E
500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] is one {{of those}} songs that's in the DNA of so much going on these days that it's hard <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> start. Its tape collage alone makes it one of the first tracks to use {{sampling}} really successfully. I also think that Brian Eno's idea of the studio-as-instrument comes from this kind of recording.|$|E
500|$|On 25 November 2014, it was {{announced}} that Goodrem had agreed to reprise her role for Neighbours 30th anniversary celebrations. Goodrem began filming that day and tweeted her excitement about Nina making a guest appearance. Her return featured during three episodes starting from 16 March 2015. Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that the theme of music would tie into the character's return. It was later confirmed that Nina returns to Erinsborough after her relationship with Jack ends. Goodrem said she understood what her character was going through, saying [...] "I have experienced the feelings Nina is going through. I've had those moments where you question where you are going and you have to look back <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> move forward." [...] The singer and actress said her return to Neighbours felt [...] "natural" [...] and she instantly knew what Nina would be wearing the moment she went into wardrobe.|$|E

500|$|Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote a mixed review, {{writing that}} the film is [...] "beautifully filmed and flashily edited", but that it [...] "has nothing to offer." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times, gave the film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "There are times when the director doesn't even seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> put the camera. Scenes unravel without dramatic point. No amount of breathless editing and fancy graphics can disguise the amateur nature of the enterprise." [...] In The Philadelphia Inquirer, Roger E. Hernandez criticized the film for its portrayal of Cubans. Hernandez wrote, [...] "The main problem here was the accents. The characters {{were supposed to be}} Cuban, but, with the exception of salsa star Celia Cruz, none sounded it." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times criticized Glimcher's direction, writing in his review, [...] "...when it comes to directing dramatic sequences, he is on his own and lacking in resources to make what drama there is come to a coherent or meaningful point." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far {{one of the most}} loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

2500|$|USA Today concluded: [...] "Sexy, {{witty and}} unabashedly peculiar, True Blood is a blood-drenched Southern Gothic romantic parable {{set in a}} world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights.

2500|$|Swarming is {{advantageous}} to less powerful countries and groups, {{because it allows}} them to balance their disadvantage in firepower and numbers. Despite being less technically advanced, Communist forces made good use of swarming in Asia during the Cold War. The Chinese were able to make up for their lack of firepower by attacking from all sides and then quickly advancing to the rear. The Vietcong were famous from attacking from all directions out of nowhere and then quickly disappearing. When they did come into close contact, they used a technique called [...] "hugging the belt", which meant they were too close for the US to employ air and artillery support. If the attackers [...] "hugged" [...] at several points, [...] "pulsing" [...] their attacks, they both neutralized external fire support, but also made it difficult for the US commander <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> commit reserves.|$|E

50|$|The {{casualties}} were primarily believed due {{to have occurred}} {{as a result of}} non-fire retardant transition tents.
