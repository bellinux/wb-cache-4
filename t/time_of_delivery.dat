25|$|The studies {{comparing}} {{the levels of}} sertraline and its principal metabolite, desmethylsertraline, in mother's blood to their concentration in umbilical cord blood at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> indicated that foetal exposure to sertraline and its metabolite is approximately {{a third of the}} maternal exposure. Concentration of sertraline and desmethylsertraline in breast milk is highly variable and, on average, is of the same order of magnitude as their concentration in the blood plasma of the mother. As a result, more than half of breast-fed babies receive less than 2mg/day of sertraline and desmethylsertraline combined, and in most cases these substances are undetectable in their blood. No changes in serotonin uptake by the platelets of breast-fed infants were found, as measured by their blood serotonin levels before and after their mothers began sertraline treatment.|$|E
25|$|Kapil Dev was a fast bowler. However, a fluent run-up and a {{gather that}} was {{perfectly}} side-on at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> {{meant that the}} outswinger came naturally to him. Usually bowled at a length and direction that always troubled the right-hander, this beautifully bowled delivery {{was the source of}} most of Kapil Dev's victims as he sought to beat the bat on the outside edge, either caught on the off-side cordon or indeed LBW and bowled in case the ball missed the edge. The side-on action meant that, for the first few years, this was the only delivery he could bowl. The deliveries that held their lines or came into the right-hander came through natural variations off the pitch. However, as he gained maturity and indeed his litheness receded, the action became less side-on and he developed an inswinger too. A highly skillful bowler, he noted in the mid-1980s that the only delivery he could not bowl at will was the leg-cutter.|$|E
500|$|The risk of {{transmission}} from mother to baby is highest {{if the mother}} becomes infected around the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before {{the birth of the}} child. In contrast, the risk falls to 3% if the [...] infection is recurrent, and is 1–3% if the woman is seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2, and is less than 1% if no lesions are visible. Women seropositive for only one type of HSV are only half as likely to transmit HSV as infected seronegative mothers. To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal. The use of antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.|$|E

2500|$|Vasa previa {{is present}} when {{unprotected}} fetal vessels traverse the fetal membranes over the internal cervical os. These vessels may be from either a velamentous insertion of {{the umbilical cord}} or may be joining an accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe to the main disk of the placenta. If these fetal vessels rupture the bleeding is from the fetoplacental circulation, and fetal exsanguination will rapidly occur, leading to fetal death. It is thought that vasa previa arises from an early placenta previa. As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta tissue surrounding the vessels over the cervix undergoes atrophy, and the placenta grows preferentially toward the upper portion of the uterus. This leaves unprotected vessels running over the cervix and in the lower uterine segment. This has been demonstrated using serial ultrasound. Oyelese et al. found that 2/3 of patient with vasa previa at delivery had a low-lying placenta or placenta previa that resolved prior to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, when Samuel {{has become}} an adult, the Philistines attack Eben-Ezer, {{eventually}} capturing the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites and kill Eli's sons, who accompany the Ark to battle as priests. (The Israelites had brought the Ark with them to battle under the premise {{that there was no}} possible way God would allow it to enter enemy hands, an assumption that proved to be incorrect.) Eli, who is nearly blind, is unaware of the event until he asks about all the commotion. Eli, sitting in a chair, is told what has happened by a soldier who has fled the battle. In reaction to the news that the Ark of God has been captured, Eli falls backwards out of the chair and dies from a broken neck, on the 10th day of Iyar. [...] He was a Judge of Israel for a total of 40 years, and dies at the age of 98.

She names the boy Ichabod, saying The Glory has departed from Israel- because of the capture of the Ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.|$|E

6000|$|First {{among the}} little {{classics}} {{of the world}} stands the Gettysburg Address. At {{the time of its}} delivery {{it does not seem to}} have been generally accepted as a notable utterance. By many of the newspaper correspondents it was referred to as [...] "remarks by the President," [...] and some of the papers contained no comment upon it. By others it was dismissed with a few words of mild praise. Even after the death of Lincoln there was no general agreement as to its supreme merits as a part of our national literature. Conflicting stories still pass current in books and articles on Lincoln about its composition, and original reception. An examination of the testimony shows that the following facts may be accepted as fairly proved. The greater part of the address was written in Washington after very careful preparation, and profound reflection. The address was read from MS., but with some variations that apparently occurred to the speaker at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Mr. Everett did not clasp the President's hand while he expressed a willingness to exchange his hundred pages for the twenty lines just read.

In this paper we present a novel kernel-level technique of detecting keyloggers. Our approach operates {{through the use of}} a decoy keyboard.

We developed a statistical model of the typing profiles of real users, which regulates the <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> emulated keystrokes.

Malware are detected in a second order fashion when data leaked by the decoy keyboard are used to access resources on the compromised machine.
