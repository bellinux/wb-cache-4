500|$|Though it was optimistic, the Restudy noted, It is {{important}} to understand that the 'restored' Everglades of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. While it certainly will be vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system.

It will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. But it will be a successfully restored Everglades, because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which defined the [...] original Everglades, and which made it unique among the world’s wetland systems.

They also {{realize that their}} equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current equipment {{for the rest of}} the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{is also an}} {{advocate}} {{for the importance of}} films being shown in large screened cinema theaters as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, [...] "The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music business—and no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage." [...] In 2014, Christopher Nolan wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal where he expressed concern that as the film industry transitions away from photochemical film towards digital formats, the difference between seeing films in theaters versus on other formats will become trivialized, leaving audiences no incentive to seek out a theatrical experience. Nolan further expressed concern that with content digitized, theaters of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to track best-selling films and adjust their programming accordingly; a process that favors large heavily marketed studio films, but will marginalize smaller innovative and unconventional pictures. In order to combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers.|$|E
500|$|When Grant {{took office}} in 1869, the nation's policy towards Indians was in chaos, with more than 250,000 Indians being governed by 370 treaties. Grant promised in his inaugural address to work toward [...] "the proper {{treatment}} of the original occupants of this land—the Indians." [...] He appointed Ely S. Parker, a Seneca Indian, {{a member of his}} wartime staff, as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to serve in this position. With his familiarity of Indian life, Parker became the chief architect of Grant's Peace Policy. In April 1869, Grant signed a law establishing a Board of Indian Commissioners to oversee spending and reduce corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1871, he signed a bill ending the Indian treaty system; the law now treated individual Native Americans as wards of the federal government, and no longer dealt with the tribes as sovereign entities. Grant believed that Indians, given opportunities for education and work, could serve alongside white men. His Peace Policy aimed to replace entrepreneurs serving as Indian agents with missionaries and aimed to protect Indians on reservations and educate them in farming. [...] "My efforts in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> directed," [...] Grant said in his second inaugural address, [...] "by a humane course, to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization... Wars of extermination... are demoralizing and wicked." ...|$|E

[...] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, [...] "FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport." ...|$|E
2500|$|In what is {{sometimes}} referred to as Hume's problem of induction, he argued that inductive reasoning, and belief in causality cannot ultimately be justified rationally; our trust in causality and induction instead results from custom and mental habit, and are attributable to only the experience of [...] "constant conjunction" [...] rather than logic: for we can never, in experience, perceive that one event causes another, but only that the two are always conjoined, and to draw any inductive causal inferences from past experience first requires the presupposition that <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> like the past, a presupposition which cannot be grounded in prior experience without already being presupposed. Hume's anti-teleological opposition to the argument for God's existence from design is generally regarded as the most intellectually significant such attempt to rebut the teleological argument prior to Darwin.|$|E

[...] Mediate, who has battled many physical problems throughout his career, nevertheless played superbly, and took the heavily favored Woods to an 18-hole playoff (and one extra sudden-death hole) before losing.

2500|$|Edgar Percival's {{aircraft}} were {{renowned for}} their graceful lines and outstanding performance. As a noted test pilot, Percival continued to fly his own creations; in 1935, he flew a Gull from England to Morocco {{and back to}} England, winning the Oswald Watt Gold Medal. He was the first pilot to fly from Britain to Africa and back in one day. He left Gravesend at 1.30am and returned to Croydon at 6.20pm. [...] "Day trips in <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> as commonplace as trips to Margate" [...] {{he said in a}} broadcast at nine o'clock. Other famous aviators were associated with Percival aircraft; in 1933, Charles Kingsford Smith flew a Percival Gull Four named Miss Southern Cross from England to Australia in the record breaking time of 7 days, 4 hours and 44 minutes. [...] The New Zealand aviator, Jean Batten, also used the Percival Gull to fly from England to Australia in October 1936. A pure racing derivative of the Gull series, the Percival Mew Gull flown by other illustrious pilots such as Alex Henshaw and Tom Campbell Black would go on to set many speed and distance records in the 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|As the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance {{stated in}} his 1897 Small Arms {{report to the}} Secretary of the Navy, [...] "In making what may appear a radical {{departure}} in its selection of a caliber smaller than as yet adopted elsewhere...the Bureau is convinced it is {{looking to the future}} … it is surely wise to attempt to advance with one stride as far as existing conditions allow toward the goal to which the world is moving with slow steps." [...] The report went on to list the advantages of the smaller 6mm caliber: greatly increased velocity, flatness of bullet trajectory, reduced recoil, a 100% increase in penetration compared to the former [...]45-70 Government cartridge, and the ability to carry twice the number of cartridges per individual sailor or marine. The report acknowledged, however, that the 6mm round had two principal disadvantages: first, as a small-caliber round, the 6mm bullet would not sufficiently wound an enemy to put him out of action, and second, the [...] "shock" [...] or stopping power of the smaller bullet would not [...] "stop the onset of excited men at short range." [...] In answer to these objections, the report gave three responses: first, [...] "the battle of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fought at long range, and men will not live to come to close quarters with an enemy who stands his ground"; second, [...] "99 percent of wounded enemy soldiers were unlikely to investigate the severity of their wound, but simply retire to the rear", and last, [...] "the explosive effect of a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet against the human body—the bullet tumbles or fragments to produce devastating wounds against bone or fluid-filled organs—would be more incapacitating at all ranges than wounds made by a slow-moving bullet of large caliber.|$|E
