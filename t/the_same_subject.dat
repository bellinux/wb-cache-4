Another {{unrelated}} film production based on the same stage play was Nandlal Jaswantlal's Anarkali, starring Bina Rai and Pradeep Kumar, which became the highest grossing Bollywood film of 1953.|$|E
5|$|De temporibus, or On Time, {{written in}} about 703, {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the principles of Easter computus. This was based on parts of Isidore of Seville's Etymologies, and Bede also included a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome's translation of the bible. In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject,</b> On the Reckoning of Time, which was influential throughout the Middle Ages. He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus.|$|E

5|$|John Rice, a boy actor {{with the}} King's Men, {{may have played}} Lady Macbeth in a {{performance}} of what was likely Shakespeare's tragedy at the Globe Theatre on 20 April 1611. The performance was witnessed and described by Simon Forman in his manuscript The Book of Plays and Notes thereof per Formans for Common Policy. His account, however, does not establish whether the play was Shakespeare's Macbeth or a work on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject</b> by another dramatist. The role may have been beyond the talents of a boy actor {{and may have been}} played by a man in early performances.|$|E
5|$|Levin was {{commissioned}} by the BBC to visit musical festivals around the world, broadcasting a series of talks about them. Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject.</b> By {{the time it was}} published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or be a father. She concluded that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into {{the wall of a}} gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Shafi'i {{school of}} thought accepts qiyas as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, {{considered}} it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur'an and sunnah. According to Shafi'i, if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject.</b> Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject</b> matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|An {{academic}} career required a doctorate, so in 1921 Urey {{enrolled in a}} PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis. His initial attempt at a thesis was on the ionization of cesium vapor. He ran into difficulties, and an Indian physicist published a better paper on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject.</b> Urey then wrote his thesis on the ionization states of an ideal gas, which was subsequently published in the Astrophysical Journal. After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater. At the conclusion of his stay, he traveled to Germany, where he met Albert Einstein and James Franck.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, French art of {{the period}} often {{depicted}} women with low necklines and slender corsets; however, the mutilation by the French royal family of the Correggio depiction of Leda and the Swan and their apparent destruction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo paintings of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject,</b> show that nudity could be controversial in France also. In northern Europe it was seen as acceptable to portray artfully draped nudes. Examples include Rubens's Minerva Victrix, of 1622–25, which shows Marie de' Medici with an uncovered breast, and Anthony van Dyck's 1620 painting, The Duke and Duchess of Buckingham as Venus and Adonis.|$|E
5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject,</b> drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
5|$|At least 25 laureates have {{received}} the Nobel Prize for contributions {{in the field of}} organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry. Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subject,</b> in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals, including four women: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009). There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded.|$|E

40|$|Crosstalk is {{a leading}} source of error in motion {{analysis}} [1 - 2]. Due to incorrect flexion axis direction that develops from marker placement error, crosstalk results in a strong, anatomically incorrect correlation between flexion-extension (FE) and adduction-abduction (AA) motions [1 - 2]. Thus, crosstalk limits the ability of biomechanical models to reflect the “true” motion of the knee. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a post-hoc correction for crosstalk in prior gait studies [1 - 2]; however, previous studies have not proposed a method to determine PCA corrected knee axes. Further, {{it is not clear}} how PCA should be implemented in motion analysis studies that involve several exercises, on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subjects,</b> involving a relatively high range of flexion angles. The long-term goal of this study is to determine accurate knee kinematics in a variety of exercises performed by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subjects.</b> This study tests two hypotheses: (1) PCA corrects for crosstalk between FE and AA angles in gait and cycling and (2) PCA corrected knee axes are similar for gait and cycling. The aims are to (1) determine PCA corrected knee angles in gait and cycling for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subjects</b> and their corresponding FE-AA correlations, (2) develop and implement an algorithm for determining PCA corrected knee FE and AA axes, and (3) compare the PCA corrected FE and AA axes for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>subjects</b> to determine if they are similar in gait and cycling...|$|R
