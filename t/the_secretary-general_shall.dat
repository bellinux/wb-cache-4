Nevertheless, this more abstract description has not prevented the office holders from speaking out and playing important roles on global issues to various degrees.

If a permanent member vetoes a candidate, it is not counted as a veto of a Security Council Resolution, as the Security Council is only making a recommendation and not passing a Resolution.|$|R
