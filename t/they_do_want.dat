5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it. Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> the information.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the newer}} {{programs}} initiated by the University of Ottawa is the Free Store. The Free Store is a location in which students can drop off items they no longer want and pick up items <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> for free. The reason this was created was to reduce consumption by offering free items to students who no longer want items {{that may be used}} by someone else. Items that are dropped off include clothing, textbooks, electronics, and office supplies. The Free Store is located at 647 King Edward. In 2007, the Office of Campus Sustainability coined the term “Gratuiterie” as the French translation to their Free Store. Since then, the concept of la Gratuiterie has gained widespread popularity in France, namely in Grenoble where the first Gratuiterie appeared. Since then France has seen a boom of “Gratuiteries” around the country.|$|E

50|$|Some {{adolescent}} girls bind their breasts {{as they enter}} puberty. This is done usually for reasons of modesty (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> others to see them), embarrassment (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> others to know they have started developing), or desire to be as they previously were (<b>they</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to have breasts yet). This has potential risks, as the developing tissue may conform to the restricted shape, resulting in permanent deformity. Breast binding in {{adolescent girls}} may be a symptom of body dysmorphic disorder.|$|R

[...] The rooms Longfellow rented were the same ones once used {{personally}} by George Washington while it was his headquarters. He proudly wrote to his friend George Washington Greene: [...] "I live in a great house which looks like an Italian villa: have two large rooms opening into each other. They were once Gen. Washington's chambers".|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{notes that}} Bell was [...] "both more lively and more honest" [...] than {{political}} statements in his time. He quotes six examples of her writing, the shortest {{of which is}} [...] "No one knows exactly what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>want,</b> least of all themselves, except that they don’t want us." [...] He quotes Bell's colleague, T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia), as saying that she was [...] "not a good judge of men or situations", and observes that [...] "If there was no ideal solution, however, there were still clear mistakes. Bell should never have acquiesced in {{the inclusion of the}} Kurdish-dominated province of Mosul in Iraq." [...] However, Stewart praises her 1920 White Paper, comparing it to General Petraeus's report to the US Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Blizzard {{will support}} the game through various updates, such as the {{competitive}} mode that was added in June 2016, and potential changes to how the Play of the Game is selected to showcase non-attacking-based Heroes. Other updates will come from monitoring the game and adjusting various attributes of the Heroes to better manage their expectations they had in designing the game {{and in response to}} player feedback. For example, one of the first planned updates was to change the strength of McCree's alternate fire [...] "Fan the Hammer" [...] ability, which could do a great deal of damage to most targets. Blizzard felt this attack should be lethal to most of the Heroes but should not be able to take out Tank-based characters in a single shot, and reduced the damage to address this. Similarly, Symmetra had major character update in late 2016 that gave her additional abilities including a second Ultimate ability, the changes made in response to Blizzard's observations that she had been infrequently selected by players. Kaplan said that while <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to promote lesser-played heroes, their goal of these updates is not to strive for equal selection rates for all heroes, but to work with the fluctuations in the meta-game as new heroes are introduced and new strategies by players are developed to counter new heroes or updates made to other heroes. Kaplan described their overall approach in these post-release adjustments as part of a [...] "balance triangle", weighing the various statistics they collect, the feedback and general attitudes from the player base they monitor, and their own personal opinions and gut feelings where the balance should be. Not all three points are equally weighed, but they consider avoiding allowing one of these areas overwhelm the other two.|$|E

60|$|It {{is of no}} use {{proving to}} any man or to any nation that they have got all they should want, if they have not got all that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>want.</b> If a servant desires to go, it is of no avail to show him that he has all he can desire in his present place. The Northerners {{say that they have}} given no offense to the Southerners, and that {{therefore}} the South is wrong to raise a revolution. The very fact that the North is the North, is an offence to the South. As long as Mr. and Mrs. Jones were one in heart and one in feeling, having the same hopes and the same joys, it was well that they should remain together. But when it is proved that they cannot so live without tearing out each other's eyes, Sir Cresswell Cresswell, the revolutionary institution of domestic life, interferes and separates them. This is the age of such separations. I do not wonder that the North should use its logic to show that it has received cause of offense but given none; but I do think that such logic is thrown away. The matter is not one for argument. The South has thought that it can do better without the North than with it; and if it has the power to separate itself, it must be conceded that it has the right.|$|E
6000|$|But {{he found}} it much more {{difficult}} to obtain comfort when he weighed the arguments brought forward against the abominations of such a borough as that for which he sat, and reflected that if Mr. Turnbull brought forward his clause, he, Phineas Finn, would be bound to vote against the clause, knowing the clause to be right, because he was a servant of the Government. The arguments, even though they appeared in the People's Banner, were true arguments; and he had on one occasion admitted their truth to his friend Lady Laura,--in the presence of that great Cabinet Minister, her husband. [...] "What business has such a man as that down there? Is there a single creature who wants him?" [...] Lady Laura had said. [...] "I don't suppose anybody does want Mr. Quintus Slide," [...] Phineas had replied; [...] "but I am disposed to think the electors should choose the man <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>want,</b> and that at present they have no choice left to them."

[...] "It is defended by tradition," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. [...] "And by its great utility," [...] said Lady Laura, bowing to the young member who was present, and forgetting that very useless old gentleman, her cousin, who had sat for the borough for many years. [...] "In this country it doesn't do to go too fast," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. [...] "And then the mixture of vulgarity, falsehood, and pretence!"

The light {{projected}} upon her innocence by his tone {{was so strong that}} the girl blushed, and he went on more tenderly: [...] "It's a pretty sight, the way you and your sister take that sort of thing for granted. Do you think property grows on you like a moustache? Well, it seems as if it had, on your father. If I owned the Reverberator I wouldn't be stumping round here; I'd give my attention to another branch of the business. That is I'd give my attention to all, but I wouldn't go round with the delivery-cart. Still, I'm going to capture the blamed thing, and I want you to help me," [...] the young man went on; [...] "that's just what I wanted to speak to you about. It's a big proposition as it stands, but I mean to make it bigger: the most universal society-paper the world has seen. That's where the future lies, and the man who sees it first is the man who'll make his pile. It's a field for enlightened enterprise that hasn't yet begun to be worked." [...] He continued, glowing as if on a sudden with his idea, and one of his knowing eyes half-closed itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked consecutively. The effect of this would have been droll to a listener, the note of the prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate hope. But it was not droll to Francie; she only thought it, or supposed it, a proof of the way Mr. Flack saw everything on a stupendous scale. [...] "There are ten thousand things to do that haven't been done, and I'm going to do them. The society-news of every quarter of the globe, furnished by the prominent members themselves--oh THEY can be fixed, you'll see!--from day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every breakfast-table in the United States: that's what the American people want and that's what the American people are going to have. I wouldn't say it to every one, but I don't mind telling you, that I consider my guess as good as the next man's on what's going to be required in future over there. I'm going for the inside view, the choice bits, the chronique intime, as they say here; what the people want's just what ain't told, and I'm going to tell it. Oh they're bound to have the plums! That's about played out, anyway, the idea of sticking up a sign of 'private' and 'hands off' and 'no thoroughfare' and thinking you can keep the place to yourself. You ain't going to be able any longer to monopolise any fact of general interest, and it ain't going to be right you should; it ain't {{going to continue to be}} possible to keep out anywhere the light of the Press. Now what I'm going to do is to set up the biggest lamp yet made and make it shine all over the place. We'll see who's private then, and whose hands are off, and who'll frustrate the People--the People THAT WANTS TO KNOW. That's a sign of the American people that <b>they</b> <b>DO</b> <b>want</b> to know, and it's the sign of George P. Flack," [...] the young man pursued with a rising spirit, [...] "that he's going to help them. But I'll make the touchy folks crowd in THEMSELVES with their information, and as I tell you, Miss Francie, it's a job in which you can give me a lovely lift." ...|$|E
