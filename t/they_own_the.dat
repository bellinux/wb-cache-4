5|$|Davies {{moved into}} writing adult {{television}} dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts {{of religion and}} sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk, his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene. Following this, his adult series in the 2000s include Bob & Rose, which portrayed a gay man who {{fell in love with}} a woman; The Second Coming, which focused on the second coming and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view; Mine All Mine, a comedy about a family who discover <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> entire city of Swansea; and Casanova, an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova.|$|E

25|$|The royalty, nobility, and gentry of Europe {{traditionally}} have many names, including phrases for the lands that <b>they</b> <b>own.</b> <b>The</b> French developed {{the method of}} putting the term by which the person is referred in small capital letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who {{is known as the}} Marquis de Lafayette. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.|$|E
25|$|On 28 September 2007, Gaston Hebert, {{the then}} apostolic {{administrator}} of the Diocese of Little Rock, stated that (per the 11 July Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) six Arkansas nuns were excommunicated for heresy (the first in the diocese's 165-year history). They refused to recant the doctrines of the Community of the Lady of All Nations (Army of Mary). The nuns {{are members of the}} Good Shepherd Monastery of Our Lady of Charity and Refuge in Hot Springs. Sister Mary Theresa Dionne, 82, one of the six, said they will still live at the convent property, which <b>they</b> <b>own.</b> <b>The</b> sect believes that its 86-year-old founder, Marie Paule Giguere, is the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary.|$|E

25|$|On March 30, 2005, the Athletics {{were sold}} to a group fronted by real estate {{developer}} Lewis Wolff, although the majority owner is John J. Fisher, son of The Gap, Inc.'s founder. Wolff, though a Los Angeles businessman, had successfully developed many real estate projects in and around San Jose. The previous ownership had retained Wolff to help them find an adequate parcel on which to construct a new stadium. Because of Wolff's background, rumors {{that he wanted to}} move the team to San Jose surfaced periodically upon his purchase of the team. However, any such plans were always complicated by the claims of the cross-bay San Francisco Giants that <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> territorial rights to San Jose and Santa Clara County.|$|E
500|$|In {{the time}} near his mother's death, Davies {{returned}} to Swansea {{several times and}} reflected {{on the role of}} family. During one visit, he realised that he had not yet written a series set in Wales; hence, he started creating a series about a family who discovers that <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> entire city of Swansea. The Vivaldi Inheritance, later renamed Mine All Mine, was based on the tale of the Welsh pirate Robert Edwards and his descendants' claim to [...] of real estate in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The series was a departure from his trend of experimental social commentary; it was instead designed to be a mainstream comedy that utilised Welsh actors: Davies and Red Productions even planned a cameo appearance by Academy Award-winning Swansea-born Catherine Zeta-Jones.|$|E
500|$|Many {{residents}} of the Corbett-Terwilliger and Lair Hill neighborhoods, over which the tram passes, were concerned the cars would be an invasion of privacy and lead to lower property values. [...] Initially, residents were promised that overhead power lines would be buried {{as part of the}} project, but as cost overruns mounted, this plan was scrapped. [...] Neighborhood opponents of the tram have cited other reasons for opposing the tram's construction, including the fact that the North Corbett neighborhood is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] Some residents filed a lawsuit against the city and OHSU, claiming that <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> [...] "airspace" [...] above their properties. [...] The city later offered to purchase homes directly under the tram route at fair market value.|$|E

500|$|After {{reading an}} article about the iLoo, Andrew Cubitt, {{inventor}} of the similarly named i-Loo, wrote to The Inquirer stating that iLoo [...] "sounds remarkably similar... it now seems that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo, the same as mine!" [...] Cubitt {{went on to say that}} [...] "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons". The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University. In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted [...] "As it was designed at the university, <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{television}} mini-series, The Legend of Billy Sing, was in post-production as of 2010. Despite {{some reports}} {{that it was}} based on Hamilton's book, the author maintained that he was never contacted by the film makers. Although Sing and his father were partly Chinese and fully Chinese, respectively, the mini-series portrayed them with actors of European ancestry. The director, Geoff Davis, was criticised for this decision. Politician Bill O'Chee, a member of the Billy Sing Commemorative Committee, said, [...] "When a person dies, all that is left is their story, and you can’t take a person’s name and not tell the truth about their story." [...] Davis has said, [...] "Whatever [...] genetic background, his culture was Australian. To me, he's very representative of every Australian whose parents were not born here. ... A lot of people are sitting at the back of this bus attacking the driver. A lot of people feel <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> story of Billy Sing. But they've probably got more resources than me—if they want to tell that story, then tell it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nokota Horse Registry is {{the breed}} registry, {{organized}} by the Nokota Horse Conservancy. There was briefly a second registry: a Minnesota-based organization called the Nokota Horse Association. [...] In October 2009, the two registries disputed which {{had the right to}} the Nokota breed name, with the Association claiming that <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> legal trademark to the name. The Registry sued, contending that they created the name and had a longer history with the breed. A US District Court ordered that the Association cease registering horses until the matter was settled, and the association disappeared from public view soon after. In the fall of 2009, another organization, the North Dakota Badlands Horse Registry, was created. This organization registers horses that have been removed from the park in recent years, stating that these horses are not accepted by the Nokota Horse Registry. [...] As of March 2011, approximately 40 horses had been registered. These horses tend to be of a slightly different phenotype and genotype than the horses registered by the Nokota Horse Registry due to the additional blood from different breeds released into the park.|$|E

SCO disavows claiming that <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> code IBM wrote, rather comparing their [...] "control rights" [...] to an easement, rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that [...] all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at Control of derivative works.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2015, {{following}} Twitter postings by Malamud teasing {{the upcoming}} release of Baby Blue, the Harvard Law Review Association threatened {{legal action against}} the project, as it believed that the name Baby Blue had a confusing similarity to the [...] "Bluebook" [...] trademark, and requested {{a copy of the}} publication to perform intellectual property examinations under a presumption that it may be substantially similar to the copyrighted work. Sprigman objected to the trademark claims, feeling that [...] "the idea <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> name 'blue' for a manual for legal citations is ridiculous." [...] Following the threats, a group of over 120 Yale Law School students issued a letter in support of the Baby Blue project. In response to the trademark concerns, the name of the guide was changed to The Indigo Book on March 31, 2016.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Teodoro Agoncillo, a Filipino {{historian}} from the University of the Philippines, mentions that the collaboration enabled the Spanish to readily subjugate the Indios (natives of the Philippines) by a potent combination of {{secular and religious}} might. The successful Legazpi conquest of the Philippines in 1565 recognized the power of clergy by bringing along Augustinian friar, navigator and priest Andrés de Urdaneta, to help control the natives. Other Spanish rulers acknowledged the importance of clergy. A Mexican viceroy (quoted in Agoncillo) said that in each friar in the Philippines, they had a captain and a whole army. However, Church involvement had numerous ill effects, as antifriar Marcelo H. del Pilar of the late 19th century complains: ...the friars control all the fundamental forces of society in the Philippines. They control the educational system, for <b>they</b> <b>own</b> <b>the</b> University of Santo Tomás, and are the local inspectors of every primary school. They control {{the minds of the}} people because in a dominantly Catholic country, the parish rectors can utilize the pulpit and confessionals to publicly or secretly influence the people.|$|E
