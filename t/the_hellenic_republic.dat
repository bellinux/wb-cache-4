The original design was differed from the current: the head of Athena was of a different design, the motto was absent, and the intertwined letters ΕΔ, the initials of ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ were placed between the arms of the cross. The reverse featured a circular white band with the words ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΗ ΔΗΜΟΚΡΑΤΙΑ. In addition, the crosses were suspended from an oval laurel wreath. [...] The overall appearance and quality of the first designs were deemed unsatisfactory, and in late 1976, the French firm Arthus Bertrand was commissioned with making a new design, sans the ΕΔ, and without the enamel, giving the blue cross a more matte appearance.
