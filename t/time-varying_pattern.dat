40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{linkages}} {{in terms of}} the first and second moments between stock and bond returns, within a wide range of advanced economies, over the different phases of the recent financial crisis. The adopted empirical framework is a bivariate volatility model, where volatility spillovers of either positive or negative sign are allowed for. Our results lend support to the existence of a substantial time-variation in the dynamic linkages between these financial assets over the different stages of the recent crisis. In particular, our results of the return spillovers show that such spillovers mostly run from stocks to bonds and exhibit a <b>time-varying</b> <b>pattern</b> over all three stages of the crisis in most countries. Regarding the volatility spillovers, such spillovers from bond returns to those of stocks are stronger than the other way round and also exhibit a <b>time-varying</b> <b>pattern</b> in most countries. Furthermore, the portfolio performance comparison results show that by considering time-varying return and volatility spillovers when calculating the risk-minimising portfolio weights of the selected assets, the portfolio volatility can be reduced despite limited diversification opportunities within national markets in times of financial crises...|$|E

Our estimates, based on a panel data-set of over 2, 000 Spanish municipalities, reveal that branch expansion had a strong positive impact on entrepreneurship.

We propose a new method for the detection and extraction of hidden periodic components embedded in an irregular cyclical series, and study the characterization of the epidemiological series in terms of the characteristic features or periodicity attributes of the extracted components. It is shown that the measles series possesses two periodic components each having a period of one year.

We are interested in modelling the <b>time-varying</b> <b>pattern</b> of average customer service times at a bank call centre. Understanding such a pattern is essential for efficient operation of a call centre. The call service times are shown to be lognormally distributed. Motivated by this observation and the important application, we propose a new method for inference about non-parametric regression curves when the errors are lognormally distributed. Estimates and pointwise confidence bands are developed. The method builds upon the special relationship between the lognormal distribution and the normal distribution, and improves upon a naive estimation procedure that ignores this distributional structure. Our approach includes local non-parametric estimation for both the mean function and the heteroscedastic variance function of the logged data, and uses local polynomial regression as a fitting tool. A simulation study is performed to illustrate the method. We then apply the method to model the time-varying patterns of mean service times for different types of customer calls.

Our framework is a high-frequency version of a structural microstructure trade model that measures the market maker’s beliefs directly. We find that the underpinnings for the <b>time-varying</b> <b>pattern</b> of the probability of informed trading are rooted in the strategic arrival of informed traders on a particular hour-of-day, day-of-week, and geographic location (market). Specifically, we document that informed traders not only pick the low activity hours, but also attach the largest market weight to a particular market. The distributions of the estimated arrival rates confirm the commitment of the informed traders to strategic trading activities. In our framework, we acknowledge that an expected loss of informed trading to the market maker is a function of both the probability of informed trading and its likely impact on the price. The impact of the uninformed traders ’ arrival on the daily foreign exchange price volatility is about twice the magnitude of the one for informed traders.
