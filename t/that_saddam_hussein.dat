25|$|On 13 December 2003, in Operation Red Dawn, Saddam Hussein was {{captured}} by American forces after being found hiding in {{a hole in the}} ground near a farmhouse in ad-Dawr, near Tikrit. Following his capture, Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. On 14 December, U.S. administrator in Iraq L. Paul Bremer confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> had indeed been captured at a farmhouse in ad-Dawr near Tikrit. Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April, a rumor emerged <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and his {{top aides}} were in a mosque complex in the Al Az'Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three {{companies}} of Marines were sent to capture him and {{came under heavy fire}} from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{reports say}} <b>that</b> after <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> ordered the {{invasion}} of Iran, Ahmadinejad joined the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution and served in their intelligence and security apparatus, but his advisor Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi says, [...] "He {{has never been a}} member or an official member of the Revolutionary Guards", having been a Basiji-like volunteer instead.|$|R
50|$|The Daily Telegraph wrote <b>that</b> {{although}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> never {{acknowledged the}} training of a youth brigade, he has, in several past speeches, spoken admiringly of the Hitler Youth.

25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And my concern is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> is heading.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state. Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|His {{two main}} {{findings}} are that leaders actually do not lie {{very much to}} other countries, and that democratic leaders are actually more likely than autocrats to lie to their own people. Thus, he starts his book by {{saying that it is}} not surprising <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> did not lie about having WMD—he truthfully said he had none—but that George Bush and some of his key advisors did lie to the American people about the threat from Iraq. Mearsheimer argues that leaders are most likely to lie to their own people in democracies that fight wars of choice in distant places. He says that it is difficult for leaders to lie to other countries because there is not much trust among them, especially when security issues are at stake, and you need trust for lying to be effective. He says that it is easier for leaders to lie to their own people because there is usually a good deal of trust between them.|$|E

50|$|Amid {{discussions on}} whether Iraq {{possesses}} the smallpox virus and <b>that</b> the <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> regime has mobile factories {{capable of producing}} chemical and biological weapons, Schmidt recommended in 2003 that Germany stockpile smallpox vaccine to guard against a possible terrorist attack. In response, members of the conservative opposition accused Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's government of withholding a true picture of the threat from Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq over {{allegations}} <b>that</b> {{its leader}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was stockpiling {{weapons of mass}} destruction including chemical and biological weapons or {{was in the process of}} creating them.

500|$|Biden {{had voted}} against {{authorization}} for the Gulf War in 1991, siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators; {{he said the}} U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition. [...] Biden was {{a strong supporter of}} the 2001 war in Afghanistan, saying [...] "Whatever it takes, we should do it." [...] Regarding Iraq, Biden stated in 2002 <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was a threat to national security, {{and that there was no}} option but to eliminate that threat. In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, justifying the Iraq War. [...] While he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a [...] "mistake", he did not push to require a U.S. withdrawal. [...] He supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should [...] "level with the American people" [...] about the cost and length of the conflict.|$|E

50|$|Scott Ritter {{points out}} in his October 19, 2005 {{interview}} with Seymour Hersh that the US policy to remove <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> from power started with President George H. W. Bush in August 1990. Ritter concludes from public remarks by President George H. W. Bush and U.S. Secretary of State James Baker that the economic sanctions would only be lifted when <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> was removed from power. The justification for sanctions was disarmament. The CIA offered the opinion <b>that</b> containing <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> for six months {{would result in the}} collapse of his regime. This policy resulted in the US military invasion and occupation of Iraq.|$|R

2500|$|Cole {{rejects the}} Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi {{cooperation}} with Al-Qaeda, noting <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> had [...] "persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number", {{as well as}} claims {{to the effect that}} Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.|$|E
2500|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq in 2003, American forces captured {{a number of}} documents detailing conversations <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> had with his inner sanctum.
