Gibraltar and Athenienne began <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind,</b> and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

5|$|At the 1982 AMOA Show, Parker Brothers {{secured the}} license to publish home {{conversions}} of the Q*bert arcade game. Parker first published a port to the Atari 2600, {{and by the}} end of 1983, the company also advertised versions for Atari 5200, Intellivision, ColecoVision, the Atari 8-bit computer family, Commodore VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A and Commodore 64. The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> the others but appeared in 1984. Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand-alone tabletop electronic game. It uses a VFD screen, and has since become a rare collector's item. Q*bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe, by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan, and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> other OECD countries, with significant differences between high and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old. The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, 90 {{percent of the}} urban {{population}} of the United States had electric power, in comparison to only 10 percent of rural homes. At the time, power companies {{did not feel that}} extending power to rural areas (rural electrification) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, {{in the midst of the}} Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.|$|E
25|$|In June 1916 the British {{preliminary}} bombardment cut much of {{the barbed}} wire protecting the Mametz defences and destroyed many of the trenches in the first position occupied by Reserve Infantry Regiment 109 of the 28th Reserve Division. When the 7th Division advanced behind a creeping barrage, {{much of the}} German front line was quickly overrun and many prisoners taken; delays further forward caused the infantry <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> the barrage and suffer far more casualties. Mametz was occupied during the morning by the 20th Brigade but a German counter-attack forced most of the British troops out, until a second attack during the afternoon, when the advance of the 18th (Eastern) Division on the right flank, had cut the Germans in the village off from Montauban to the east. The German defence collapsed and the 7th Division reached all its objectives {{on the right and}} in the centre and began to consolidate, ready to receive a German counter-attack.|$|E
25|$|The land reform, {{implemented}} by Sfatul Țării in 1918–1919, {{resulted in a}} rise of a middle class, as 87% of the region's population lived in rural areas. The reform was however marred by {{the small size of}} the awarded plots, as well as by preferential allotment of land to politicians and administrative personnel who had supported the political goals of the Romanian government. Generally, urban development and industry were insignificant, and the region remained primarily an agrarian rural region throughout the interwar period. Certain improvements were achieved in the area of education, the literacy rate rising from 15.6% in 1897 to 37% by 1930; however, Bessarabia continued <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> the rest of the country, the national literacy rate being 60%. During the inter-war period, Romanian authorities also conducted a program of Romanianization that sought to assimilate ethnic minorities throughout the country. The enforcement of this policy was especially pervasive in Bessarabia due to its highly diverse population, and resulted in the closure of minority educational and cultural institutions.|$|E

25|$|An {{advance party}} of Major General George Crook's {{division}} reached the important railroad intersection of Burkeville Junction, Virginia by 3:00p.m., blocking the Richmond and Danville Railroad {{route to the}} southwest. The main body of Crook's cavalry division and Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's infantry brigade from the V Corps also headed toward Jetersville, arriving before dark. A few hours later, {{the rest of the}} V Corps arrived at Jetersville and started to entrench, even extending the trenches across the railroad tracks. The arrival of the entire V Corps at Jetersville ended Lee's last chance to move south along the railroad, although if he had chosen to send Longstreet's corps which had arrived first at Amelia Court House south against the gathering Union force, his trailing divisions probably could not have caught up. Ewell was still trying to cross the Appomattox River at 10:00p.m.; Anderson was still skirmishing with Devin at Beaver Pond Creek; Gordon was several miles behind at Scott's Shop; and Mahone was not far from Goode's Bridge, waiting to protect the bridge in case Ewell could find no other river crossing. When Devin's cavalry broke off the engagement at Beaver Pond Creek, no Union force threatened the rear of Lee's army and Anderson's and Mahone's forces did not need <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> as rear guards. They did not arrive at Amelia Court House until well into the next day.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, the Soviet economy slowed, {{and began}} <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> {{that of the}} West due to {{the high level of}} {{expenditure}} on the armed forces and too little spending on light industry and consumer goods. Soviet agriculture could not feed the urban population, let alone provide for the rising standard of living, which the government promised as the fruits of [...] "mature socialism", and on which industrial productivity depended. One of the most prominent critics of Brezhnev's economical policies was Mikhail Gorbachev who, when leader, called the economy under Brezhnev's rule [...] "the lowest stage of socialism". Soviet GNP growth rates began to decrease in the 1970s from the level it held in the 1950s and 1960s; its growth rates began <b>to</b> <b>lag</b> <b>behind</b> Western Europe and the United States. The GNP growth rate was slowing to 1% to 2% per year, and with Soviet technology falling ever farther behind that of the West, the Soviet Union was facing economic stagnation by the early 1980s. During Brezhnev's last years in power, the CIA monitored the Soviet Union's economic growth, and reported that the Soviet economy peaked in the 1970s, calculating that it had then reached 57% of the American GNP. The development gap between the two nations widened, with the United States growing an average of 1% per year above the growth rate of the Soviet Union.|$|E

However, the corps was unable to cross the river due to the firm German defenses on the other side. On the next day, in order to end German resistance on the left flank, where the attacks of the 12th Tank Corps and 154th Rifle Division were unsuccessful, the corps was ordered withdrawn from the front in the Zhukovo area and reconcentrated in the forest [...] west of Myzin.
