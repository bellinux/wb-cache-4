40|$|The {{most potent}} foreign antigens for natural killer T cells (NKT cells) are α-linked glycolipids, whereas NKT cell self-reactivity {{involves}} weaker recognition of structurally distinct β-linked glycolipid antigens. Here we provide the {{mechanism for the}} autoreactivity of T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) on NKT cells to the mono- and tri-glycosylated β-linked agonists β-galactosylceramide (β-GalCer) and isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb 3), respectively. In binding these disparate antigens, the NKT cell TCRs docked onto CD 1 d similarly, achieving this by flattening the conformation of the β-linked ligands regardless {{of the size of}} the glycosyl head group. Unexpectedly, the antigenicity of iGb 3 was attributable to its <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>group</b> making compensatory interactions with CD 1 d. Thus, the NKT cell TCR molds the β-linked self ligands to resemble the conformation of foreign α-linked ligands, which shows that induced-fit molecular mimicry can underpin the self-reactivity of NKT cell TCRs to β-linked antigens...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe GM 2 {{activator}} protein (GM 2 AP) is an accessory protein {{that is an}} essential component in the catabolism of the ganglioside GM 2. A function of GM 2 AP is to bind and extract GM 2 from intralysosomal vesicles, forming a soluble protein-lipid complex, which interacts with the hydrolase Hexosaminidase A, the enzyme that cleaves the <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>group</b> of GM 2. Here, we used site-directed spin labeling with power saturation electron paramagnetic resonance to determine the surface-bound orientation of GM 2 AP upon phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Because GM 2 AP extracts lipid ligands from the vesicle and is undergoing exchange {{on and off the}} vesicle surface, we utilized a nickel-chelating lipid to localize the paramagnetic metal collider to the lipid bilayer-aqueous interface. Spin-labeled sites that collide with the lipid-bound metal relaxing agent provide a means for mapping sites of the protein that interact with the lipid bilayer interface. Results show that GM 2 AP binds to lipid bilayers such that the residues lining the lipid-binding cavity lie on the vesicle surface. This orientation creates a favorable microenvironment that can allow for the lipid tails to flip out of the bilayer directly into the hydrophobic pocket of GM 2 AP...|$|E

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : The role of glycoconjugate <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars</b> on {{development}} of fetal tissues as inducing factors has been distinguished. Lectinhistochemistry tracing of α-L- fucose <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar,</b> defining its effective time and elucidating its specific role in {{development of the}} mouse kidney were among the main objectives of this study. Materials and methods : Fetuses of Balb/c pregnant mice on 9 th – 20 th gestational days were fixed by formalin. Specimens were histologically parffinized after dehydration. Serial sections were done for preparation of 10 micrometer sections. Lotus tetragonolobus (LTA) lectin as specific tracer of α-L-fucose <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> was diluted as standard solution (10 micrograms lectin in 1 ml PBS as defined by Sigma Company). Usable sections which had been matched by alcian blue were posed to lectin. Then alcian blue was used as counterstain.

Range and intensity of reaction to LTA increased in higher gestational day. This phenomenon reached to maximum on 19 - 20 th fetal days. Outstanding point was selective reaction of urinary tubes to lectin and other tissues were stained merely by alcian blue. Conclusion : Previous researches have confirmed that <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars</b> reveal in some stages of organogenesis and do their key roles on development.

40|$|Alteration of <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars</b> of goblet cell mucins in {{the small}} {{intestinal}} mucosa was examined by lectin histochemistry in rats infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. To see whether alteration {{of the nature of}} mucins was regulated by the local immune system, adult worms were implanted intraduodenally into recipient rats of various immune status. When 7 -day-old ('normal') adult worms were implanted into naive euthymic rats, about 60 % remained until day 7 and then were expelled. The number of goblet cells transiently decreased on day 5 and then progressively increased from day 9 onwards. In parallel with the hyperplasia, mucins in and released from goblet cells strongly expressed terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine which was specifically recognized by Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA). When 13 -day-old ('damaged') adult worms were implanted into naive euthymic rats, they were rapidly expelled by day 9 in association with hastened goblet cell hyperplasia and the alteration of <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars</b> of the mucins. Hastened worm expulsion, goblet cell hyperplasia and alteration of <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars</b> of the mucins were also observed when 'normal' worms were implanted into immune recipients. On the other hand, after implantation of 'normal' worms into hypothymic (rnu/rnu) rats, goblet cell hyperplasia or the alteration of <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars</b> of the mucins was almost completely absent. These results suggest that alteration of sugar residues of goblet cell mucins, especially the strong expression of terminal N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, is regulated by the host's immune system and seems to be important in the expulsion of N. brasiliensis...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that epididymial and its {{secretions}} are critical for sperm maturation.

Moreover lectins have been employed as useful probes to detect the presence of glycoconjugates with specific sugar residues such as sialic acid. Considering the importance of sialic acid, distribution of this <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> in different parts of mouse epididymis was studied by means of lectin histochemistry. For this purpose, epididymial tissue species were obtained from 15 adult male BALB/c mice. After fixation and routine laboratory process, 5 µm sections prepared from paraffin blocks. Slides were exposed to lectins with lectin-histochemistry. For this purpose, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), specific for sialic acid, was employed. Then they assessed with light microscope. The rate of reactions in epithelial cells and spermatozoa were significantly different parts of epididyms. In this manner that, in spermatozoa, stereo cilia and luminal surface the least reactions were seen in caput, while the most reactions were seen in cauda. Epithelial cells, too, showed less reaction in caput comparing to corpus and tail of epididyms. Sialic acid has been identified in many glycoproteins secreted by epididyms and is necessary for sperm maturation. It seems that this maturation happens mostly in body and tail of epididyms during epididymial transit. Increase in sialic acid content of spermatozoa during epididymial transit is probably due to the secretion of glycoconjugates containing this component by epididymial principal and flask cells.

40|$|Background: Increasingly {{bacterial}} biofilms {{have been}} implicated in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), and conventional treatment methods have failed to completely eradicate biofilms. (1) Terminal sialic acids present on sinus mucosal glycoproteins are targets for bacterial adherence and biofilm formation. (2) A subpopulation of CRS patients is more susceptible to biofilm formation due to aberrant terminal sialic residue distribution patterns of glycoproteins on their mucosa. (3) The higher levels of sialyl transferase (ST) 6 Gal 1 gene expression contribute to the overall aberrant glycosylation patterns on the host mucosa that predispose this patient cohort to developing biofilms. (4) Mucin glycoprotein MUC 7 that has known bactericidal activity displays an overall reduced <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> profile in biofilm positive CRS patients. Methods: Confocal scanning laser microscopy, glycoarray analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction of ST 6 Gal 1, neuraminidase assays and multivariate analysis were used to compare production of sialic acid-degrading enzymes in sinus biopsies from biofilm positive and negative CRS patients with mucosa from healthy controls. Results: Biofilm-positive CRS patients expressed aberrant glycoprotein patterns with terminal sialics of between 70 and 90 kD (stress value = 0. 1414). The ST 6 Gal 1 gene was upregulated, and bacteria isolated from these patients exhibit significantly higher neuraminidase activity (p = 0. 0343). We detected a significant lack in the overall expression of <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> residues of MUC 7 (stress value = 0. 088). Conclusions: We observed a strong positive correlation between the aberrant <b>terminal</b> <b>sugar</b> patterns in this sub group of CRS patients with biofilms.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the glycosylation pattern in paraxial mesenchyme-forming vertebrae by using the lectin histochemical technique. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, B 4 G fixed paraffin sections of 9 to 15 day Balb/c mouse embryos were processed for histochemical studies using seven different HRP-labelled lectins: Glycin max (SBA), Maclura pomifera (MPA), Wistaria floribunda (WFA), Vicia villosa (VVA) which all of them are specific for N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), Ulex europius (UEA 1, binds to α-L-fucose), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, binds to sialic acid), and Griffonia simplicifolia (GSA 1 -B 4, binds to galactose <b>terminal</b> <b>sugars).</b> The sections were observed separately by three examiners who were blinded to the lectins. Grading was done according to the intensity of the tested lectins’ reactions with the specimen, from negative (-) to severe (+++). Data was analysed with SPSS software (version 11. 5) and the non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test; p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: Our findings showed that among the tested lectins, only GalNAc residue sensitive lectins showed regulated changes in paraxial mesenchyme. Reactions of WFA and MPA lectins with paraxial mesenchyme were severe on GD 9. Reactions of WFA continued to GD 15 constantly, while MPA reactions continued strongly to GD 12, significantly decreased thereafter (p< 0. 001), and then disappeared.

The structure and site-directed mutagenesis data presented here are consistent with a mechanism where the two different reactions of AknOx are catalyzed in the same active site but by different active site residues. Tyr- 450 is responsible for proton removal from the C- 4 hydroxyl group in the first reaction, the oxidation of rhodinose to cinerulose A. Tyr- 378 acts as a catalytic base involved in proton abstraction from C 3 of cinerulose A in the second reaction, for formation l-aculose. Replacement of this residue, however, does not impair the conversion of rhodinose to cinerulose A...|$|R
