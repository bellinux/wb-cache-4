40|$|Establishing and prioritising {{the factors}} that may {{influence}} the final contract price when responding to a call for tenders is crucial for proper risk analysis and reliable forecasting; it could make or mar the ability to achieve expected profit margin {{in an era of}} lump sum fixed price contracts where clients often contest variation claims. In New Zealand, these factors have not been researched; hence estimators rely only on judgement to ‘guess-estimate’ in their price forecasting. This study aimed to fill the knowledge gap by investigating the priority factors. 150 responses from professional members of the New Zealand Institute of Quantity Surveyors were analysed using multi-attribute method. Results showed thirty-seven factors which could influence the final contract price; the three most influential being poor tender documentation, complexity of design & construction, and completeness of project information. Other factors relating to project, client and contractor characteristics, design consultants and <b>tendering</b> <b>conditions,</b> estimating practice and external factors were reported. Concordance analysis indicated high level of agreement amongst survey participants in the rank-ordering of the relative importance of the identified factors. The findings could assist quantity surveyors to prepare more reliable contract price estimates at the pre-contract stage. It would also improve construction-stage cost control...|$|E
40|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990 s, inefficiency, {{excess supply}} and low service quality {{characterized}} the mass transit system of Bogotá. The average travel time to work was one hour and ten minutes, obsolete buses provided public transport, traffic generated 70 percent of air pollution and there were frequent traffic accidents. To address all of these issues, the municipal and national governments designed and put in place a new mass transit system named TransMilenio (TM), which came into operation in January 2001. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Bogotá´s mass transit system before and after TM, study the political economy of its adoption process and conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of the first phase of the system. The new transit system is a hybrid model that combines public planning of the network structure, route <b>tendering</b> <b>conditions,</b> regulation and supervision, as well as private operation of the separated functions of revenue collection and transport service. The adoption of this new model needed to resolve delicate political economy issues that characterized private transport systems in many developing countries. The new organization had a sizeable impact on TM users´ by improving traveling conditions significantly. In addition, congestion, pollution and traffic accidents plummeted in TM corridors. However, the type of transition adopted for the remaining transport corridors not covered by TM caused unforeseen negative spillovers, as a consequence of slow scrapping rates and bus and routes relocation. Consequently, although the CBA for the first phase of the corridors covered by TM is positive, once these additional measures are taken into consideration, the net effect is negative due primarily to increases in travel time for passengers using the traditional transport system. In order to minimize the negative spillovers during the full implementation of TM, expected to last until 2015, integration of the traditional and new systems should be carried on, and strict regulation of the traditional public transport system should be crafted. urban transport, political economy, cost-benefit analysis...|$|E

It is argued that a new 'Tendering Code' should be produced in the style and format of a contract document which reflects not only the statutory regulation imposed on public bodies, but common law decisions of the courts. The nature of this tendering contract is explained as a means of regulating the tendering process. Issues discussed are: dealing with errors and irregularities found in tenders; dealing with non-compliant tenders; dealing with tender withdrawal prior to its acceptance or rejection; making provisions as to time for submission of tenders and dealing with late tenders; making provision for submission of tender by fax or other electronic means; making provision for evaluation of tenders received; and imposing or negotiating reductions in price with tenderers prior to acceptance. The paper concludes that the common law obligations placed on the owner to treat all tenderers equally and fairly and to apply the <b>tender</b> <b>conditions</b> when evaluating <b>tenders</b> and awarding contracts seems to be good common sense and of commercial advantage, not only to the immediate parties concerned but also to the wider community.

40|$|Other {{agents in}} the {{employment}} service – A case study of the outsourcing principles of Copenhagen municipality This project examines how outsourcing principles in Danish employment policies are manifested in other agents’ employment services, and which consequences this has for the employment options of unemployed academics. The research question is examined using the county of Copenhagen as a critical case. The project uses an induct approach, in which tender documents from the latest tenders of the county of Copenhagen and three interviews with unemployed academics are used as the central empirical data of the project. Firstly it is examined how the employment system has developed since 1990 and how the use of outsourcing has emerged. Three fundamental principles are identified: Outsourcing should lead to specialisation, efficiency and social disciplining. Using an understanding based on new-institutional theory, the outsourcingprinciples {{can be seen as}} rational myths, which make sense in a new public management thinking. The three identified principles are used consistently in the project as the basis of thematising and analysing the empirical data. This is with the aim of discovering how the principles affect other agents’ employment services; and thereby what the unemployed academics’ chances of reemployment are. In this analysis of the latest <b>tender</b> <b>conditions</b> by the City of Copenhagen, it appears that the outsourcingprinciples have consciously been included in the writing of the <b>tender</b> <b>conditions.</b> Furthermore it is possible to trace a decoupling of the specialisation in the employment services and of the purchase of capacity, as well as a decoupling of the policyproducing module, the authority-module and the action-oriented workmodules. Hereafter it is analysed how deeply the outsourcingprinciples have been institutionalised with the agents. It is concluded that Akademikernes have primarily seen regulative and normative institutionalisation, whereas a deeper cognitive institutionalisation can be seen with Ballisager. This difference can be explained using the understanding of {{the difference between the two}} organisations which are respectively an unemployment fund and a private company; thereby using the understanding of the differences in expectations and pressure from the outside world. Finally the investigation includes an analysis of whether the requirements of the unemployed are being met by the services offered by other agents. Based on the inter-views with the unemployed, we can conclude that they find specialisation and self-responsibility important in the process of finding a job. The unemployed support the outsourcingprinciples about specialisation and social regimentation. There is, however, not a foundation for concluding that the unemployed find that outsourcing requires these principles. It is concluded that there is a decoupling between goals and results. This decoupling is seen at Ballisager, which claims to be specialised, even though the unemployed see them as lacking in specialisation. Furthermore it is concluded that the unemployed view the outsourcing as a means of increasing capacity rather than quality, and therefore they do not find outsourcing to be a logical solution. Finally it is concluded that the requirements which seek to legitimise the rational myths of outsourcing and secure social regimentation, may limit the extent to which the goals of specialisation and efficiency are achieved...|$|R

40|$|The Master Thesis {{deals with}} the {{adoption}} of building information modeling or BIM into the Slovenian public procurement system. We have carried out {{a detailed analysis of}} the possibility of introducing BIM within the current legislation on public procurement. It is described how public clients can approach the implementation through tenders for public works contracts and how tenderers for design or construction can adapt. We have highlighted the potential impact of the implementation {{on the quality of the}} final products and the construction process itself. Due to the global financial crisis the development of Slovenian construction sector has fallen behind the leading European and world countries. One of the construction industry areas where this is most obvious is building information modeling. Due to the complexity and uniqueness of construction projects, many foreign countries have decided to introduce BIM into the public procurement system through their legislation, which is now encouraged with the European directive. For this reason, it makes sense to find out why the implementation in Slovenia has not yet occurred, how it could be done and what would the benefits for the State, public clients and tenderers (design and construction companies) be. For this a brief summary of the main features of BIM, Slovenian procurement system and different contractual relations has been made in the first part of the Master Thesis. The second part includes a detailed analysis of different means of introducing BIM in public construction contracts via requirements, <b>tender</b> <b>conditions</b> and criteria for the selection of the most economically advantageous tender and presents change requirements in the national strategy and the development of guidance and normative documents. Particular emphasis is placed on the implementation period and the necessary changes in contractual relations. Comparing Slovenia with foreign countries has allowed us to determine the main advantages of BIM implementation for public clients: the efficient use of public funds, increased quality of construction projects and improved communication and coordination. The third part provides the perspective of tenderers and an analysis of the effects that the BIM implementation would have on them. Requirements for the proper BIM implementation into the firms' workflows and mutual cooperation on projects have also been discovered and presented. The main advantages of the implementation such as better and faster execution of projects and increased business competitiveness have been velidated by comparison with abroad. Analysis of both aspects (the State and the tenderers) have provided the basis for the conclusion that adoption of BIM is necessary to improve the quality of public procurement and should be encouraged by the government, as the current situation does not provide sufficient incentives for companies to develop in the direction of BIM...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} typical {{decisions}} made by contracting entities which restrict the competition among economic operators. The thesis analyses the typical mistakes which are made by the contract entities in awarding procedures. The causes of mistakes being made by contracting entities can be summarized into three groups. Into the first group belong conscious mistakes. For these mistakes shall be contracting entities` agents held responsible. Into the second group belong mistakes in planning. Mistakes from the third group are made {{as a consequence of}} lack of professional skills. None of these mistakes can be prevented just by an amendment to the Act on Public Contracts. Any proposal of an amendment solving the lack of professional skills shall consider also all connected negative effects; mainly additional time demands, financial costs and the risk of underfinanced praxis turning into formalism. Professionally skilled agents are usually more careful when they apply the Act on Public Contracts because they are aware of legal risks. Considering current limited budget resources it should be decided whether to put stress on cooperation with internal or external experts. The author recommends internal experts because external experts do not do their best if they are aware of the fact being not controlled effectively by internal experts. However the current Act on Public Contracts is not perfect, the duties laid by it are enforced successfully. Considering a new amendment also the legal theory shall be taken into account. The author presumes similarity of preventing of breaches against the Act on Public Contracts and of preventing of crimes. The most important factor preventing from criminality is to be aware that the punishment is inescapable, not its rates. The author points out also the opinion of the general theory of law according to which a new act is to be passed only if there is an objective necessary need. It should not to be passed by a fortuity or because of subjective views. There should be also a time space between the amendments. There was an amendment to Act on Public Contracts approved in 2010 and European Union currently prepares amending of awarding directives. The author therefore prefers improving the praxis of awarding in the Czech Republic by granting additional human resources to the Office for the Protection of Competition to passing of another amendment to the Act on Public Contracts. The scope of the Act on Public Contracts is also not convenient for amending a list of contract clauses which are not allowed to be concluded by contracting entities. There are two reasons. Contracting entities are constituted by various groups of subjects and contracts selling their property are outside the scope of the Act on Public Contracts. Contracting entities should use standard awarding procedure to promote competition among economic operators. They should concentrate on exactness of <b>tender</b> <b>conditions.</b> A good prevention to mistakes in awarding procedure is also good planning and skilled human recourses of contracting entities...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research exposes to examination and understanding the law governing procurement of construction and engineering works and services. The thesis captures both development of common law and judicial determination of statutory law. It {{takes the form of}} published journal articles and conference papers which discuss legal issues relevant to construction procurement and conclude with recommendations for clients and construction project managers on how to better manage the procurement process. The work reveals, inter alia, the extent to which contract law regulates the tendering phase of construction procurement and places the client under an obligation to the tenderer characterised as 'fair dealing' or 'good faith'. Chapter 1 is of an introductory nature. Chapter 2 sets the crime of manslaughter arising out of construction site fatality as a procurement issue. The author notes the UK government's intention to introduce the new offences of reckless killing, killing by gross carelessness and corporate killing. Chapter 3 discusses cases where disaffected parties to the tendering process have made private law challenges of that process seeking compensation for the other party's alleged irregularities. The client is generally obliged in law to treat all tenderers equally and fairly and to refrain from evaluating tenders and awarding contracts other than in accordance with the rules set down in the <b>tender</b> <b>conditions.</b> Chapter 4 addresses the question: do traditional tendering processes encourage, or merely permit, contractor innovation? Several tender codes are reviewed to establish whether these codes provide for, or encourage, innovative proposals from competing bidders. Chapter 5 provides updating case material for the period 1999 - 2000 which helps to underpin the conclusions and recommendations set out in Chapter 12. Chapter 6 is a criticism of the NJCC's Code of Procedure for Single Stage Selective Tendering and the CIB's Code of Practice for the Selection of Main Contractors. Suggestions are made as to what a new tender code might include in the light of selected decisions of the common law courts. It is argued that a set of 'standard' tender rules should become the terms of a 'tender contract'. Those rules would properly reflect decisions of the courts and would be accepted by all parties to the process as a tender contract document. Chapter 7 discusses how the common law protects the integrity of construction procurement by imposed or assumed contractual obligations. Procurement of subcontract works is also considered. The author concludes that the tendering contract operates between main contractor and subcontractor as it does between owner/ developer and main contractor, and that the 'two contract' analysis provides the best basis for upholding integrity of the bidding process. Chapter 8 sets out advice for quantity surveyors and project managers derived from the decisions of the common law courts. The author argues that practice should be shaped to reflect the obligations assumed by parties in common law so as to avoid claims from aggrieved bidders. In Chapter 9 the focus shifts from private to public law. A Scottish court denied a remedy to the unsuccessful bidder {{on the grounds that the}} contract award process was unfair, unreasonable and in breach of natural justice. The author argues that a successful case might have been made out in private law and concludes with recommendations as to how the tender process might be better conducted. Chapter 10 deals with public procurement under the rules of the European Union (EU), noting a particularly important decision by the European Court of Justice that contracting authorities are obliged to treat all tenderers equally and fairly, a duty that parallels that found in common law and discussed in Chapters 2 through 8. Chapter 10 concludes with an article on Rv Portsmouth City Council (1996), reviewing both decisions at first instance and in the English Court of Appeal. Chapter 11 considers the risks of developers and contractors by examining the effectiveness of 'controls' imposed by common law when the usual statutory controls are temporarily withdrawn. It can be seen that the common law has not evolved to protect the interests of neighbours and local residents from the perils and hazards of property development which result in environmental degradation. This chapter concludes with recommendations as to how developer and constructors might minimise their impact on adjacent property owners. Chapter 12 presents a summary of the conclusions drawn from the completed research project and the author's recommendations for further research within the procurement topic...|$|R
40|$|Upon Austria's {{entry into}} Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) took on new tasks {{in the field}} of payment systems. January 4, 1999, marked the launch of the {{cross-border}} real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system TARGET. This system, in which EU-wide some 5, 000 credit institutions participate, is composed of the national RTGS payment systems operated in the EU countries, the ECB Payment Mechanism (EPM) and an interface component called Interlinking. Austria's RTGS system, ARTIS, is integrated into TARGET. TARGET was designed as a real-time system, i. e., in normal circumstances payments reach their destination within a few seconds or minutes after being debited from the account of the sending participants, with all payments treated equally, irrespective of their value and destination. As a gross settlement system, TARGET guarantees intraday finality of payments, since transactions are settled individually. Throughout a business day, TARGET enables participating credit institutions to flexibly manage their liquidity, as they may use their minimum reserves for settlement purposes during the day. Banks may obtain unlimited intraday credit free of charge by providing adequate collateral, namely tier-one and tier-two assets. Euro 1 set up by the Euro Banking Association (EBA), Euro Access Frankfurt (EAF) and the Paris Net Settlement (PNS) system, among others, provide key alternative channels for processing payments in euro. Compared with centralised systems, TARGET with its multitude of interfaces is more susceptible to technical incidents. Even though its fees are higher, the majority of euro-denominated payments are processed via TARGET. Starting with the January 1998 reporting period, the OeNB introduced a new balance-of-payments presentation scheme. Transactions associated with the settlement of TARGET payments are recorded under "Currency and deposits" of monetary authorities (liabilities side) under the other investment sub-account of the financial account. In the first half of 1999, such transactions ran to ATS 66. 4 billion net. This item may not, however, be explained as an opposite position of the structural current account deficit of Austria vis-à-vis the EU 15, since TARGET transactions fall predominantly under the interbank category. The capital imported via central bank payment traffic is tantamount to borrowing by the "Austrian economy" that is basically financed at most favourable (<b>tender</b> rate) <b>conditions.</b> Die Rolle der OeNB im europäischen Zahlungsverkehr; The Role of the OeNB in the European Payment System...|$|R

While some members of Trans Union 2 ̆ 7 s senior management initially objected to the deal, claiming that it amounted to a 2 ̆ 2 lock-up 2 ̆ 2 which 2 ̆ 2 would inhibit other offers, 2 ̆ 2 the deal eventually went on to fruition, and ultimately, litigation. In a 2 ̆ 2 lock-up 2 ̆ 2 merger agreement, a bidder 2 ̆ 7 s <b>tender</b> offer is <b>conditioned</b> upon the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s receiving the option to purchase treasury shares of the target corporation at a price below the tender offer. The term 2 ̆ 2 lock-up 2 ̆ 2 seems to derive from the perception that such agreements 2 ̆ 2 lock-out 2 ̆ 2 other potential bidders that find it economically infeasible to enter competing bids for the diluted stock...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards under the relevant regimes in the GCC states, both local law and international conventions. The easy enforceability of arbitral awards {{is considered one of the}} main factors in the success of international commercial arbitration. Thus this thesis not only attempts a comprehensive analysis of the requirements of and procedures for recognition and enforcement of foreign awards in the GCC States, but also evaluates whether the GCC’s laws and practices comply with best international practice standards, especially as embodied in the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The thesis comprises of seven chapters. The first chapter examines the legal framework of the GCC States, and provides a brief history of the rules governing arbitration and the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. Chapter two looks at general principles regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. Chapter three covers jurisdictional elements in the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in the GCC States. Chapter four examines the procedural steps demanded by each state for the enforcement of an award, looking particularly at the impact of relevant international conventions on these issues. Chapter five deals with the evidence which must be <b>tendered</b> and the <b>conditions</b> that must be satisfied in order to obtain the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the GCC States. Chapter six examines the grounds on which a respondent may apply to dismiss an application for recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award. Chapter seven then deals with the grounds on which a foreign arbitral award must be refused enforcement. The concluding chapter summarises the problems thrown up by the study, and suggests a common way forward for the legal systems of the states of the Arabian Gulf in dealing with these issues...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} neo-classical {{micro-economic}} theory with tendering {{theory in the}} context of price formation in the building industry. It examines the two theories and determins that while there are problems with the application of both theories, there are no a priori reasons why either theory should be inapplicable. After discussing the appropriate criteria for selecting between competing theories, the theories were compared on how well they explain and predict the impacts of changes in the level of activity in the market/industry, the distribution of tenders, the strategy for maximising profit, the winner's curse, the accuracy of estimates, the socially accepted price and adjustments to productive capacity. On all criteria the neo-classical model performed better than did the tendering theory. However, both theories have a non-falsifiable motivational core assumption. In addition, neo-classical micro-economics has a set of ceteris paribus <b>conditions</b> and <b>tendering</b> theory has a probabilistic outcome which in practice means that neither theory is falsifiable. Although it is therefore not possible to verify or falsify either theory, the assumptions used in the neo-classical theory are more realistic and clearly identify the domain of the theory, while the assumptions of tendering theory are such that the building industry {{is not likely to be}} part of its domain, and it is therefore not applicable to the industry. It is, however, possible to synthesise neo-classical micro-economics with elements of tendering theory into a neo-classical tendering theory that predicts the winning price, the probability of success with a given bid and the potential profit probability density function. This theory has distinctly neo-classical characteristics. The units of analysis are the firm and the market, not the individual tender or the industry. The profit maximising price is determined by market <b>conditions.</b> <b>Tendering</b> decisions are made in two stages. The objective in stage 1 is to assess if the winning tender will be sufficiently high to satisfy the aims of the tenderer. In stage 2 the objective is to establish a bid with a desired probability of being successful or the desired risk/reward ratio...|$|R
