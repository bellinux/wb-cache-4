5|$|During World War II, {{and after}} Perry Ellwood died in 1943, May Ellwood again altered the home; <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>on</b> fuel oil, {{she had the}} upper floors of the house closed off.

The library's plaster cornice and other architectural details have been restored based on a 1912 photograph. In 1964 the home was donated {{to the city of}} DeKalb and converted into a museum.|$|E

5|$|Rodis's input in {{developing}} the early character and costume designs was significant. Shatner praised his costume designs as being futuristic but plausible and {{in keeping with the}} continuity established in previous Star Trek films. After being disappointed by the costume designers approached to realize Rodis' ideas, Shatner suggested that Rodis become the costume designer as well. Bennett hired Dodie Shepard as the costume supervisor; Shepard's role was to oversee the costume fabrication and keep track of the clothes during filming. <b>To</b> <b>save</b> <b>on</b> costs, Shepard clothed extras with existing items from Western Costume's warehouses. The constrained budget meant Shatner could not completely redesign the Starfleet uniforms, but Rodis created new brown field uniforms for the film's location scenes as well as the leisure clothes the crew wears during shore leave.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>on</b> development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

25|$|April 1988 saw Skywalker end its {{operations}} at the airport. The airline attributed it to a drop in demand for the service.

25|$|The {{implementation}} of the Act proved impossible, particularly in the industrial north which suffered from cyclical unemployment. The cost of implementing the Settlement Laws in operation since the 17th century was also costly and so these were not implemented fully: it often proved too costly to enforce the removal of paupers. The Commission could issue directives, but these were often not implemented fully {{and in some cases}} ignored in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>on</b> expenses (Darwin Leadbitter 1782–1840 {{was in charge of the}} commission's finances).|$|E
