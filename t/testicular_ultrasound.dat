50|$|Testicular microlithiasis is {{an unusual}} {{condition}} diagnosed on <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> It is found in between 1.5 to 5% of normal males, and {{may be found in}} up to 20% of individuals with subfertility. It is an asymptomatic, non-progressive disease. The cause is unknown, but this condition has been associated with testicular cancer in a small group of individuals, cryptorchidism, mumps, infertility and intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia. Classic testicular microlithiasis is defined as five or more echogenic foci per view in either or both testes, and limited testicular microlithiasis defined as one or more echogenic foci that do not satisfy the criteria for classic testicular microlithiasis. In 80% of cases, both testicles are affected.|$|E
30|$|The {{rationale}} of a urologist led one-stop testicular clinic was {{to expedite}} the patient’s journey through from referral to diagnosis {{and then to}} treatment (Kendall et al. 1996). <b>Testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> scanning forms {{an integral part of}} the clinic format. The key personnel required to run these clinics are a urologist who takes a detailed history and examination, and a testicular cancer specialist nurse. Facilities for phlebotomy and for <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> scanning (to be done ideally by the urologist) have to be available and the appropriate patient literature on all testicular pathology needs to be present. This type of clinic format would result in a prompt patient journey from referral to diagnosis.|$|E

Several studies have highlighted its possible correlation {{with an increased}} risk of testicular cancer, but few studies have investigated its possible link with dyspermia. Objectives: The aim of our study was to investigate in our series the number of patients with microlithiasis, diag-nosed by ultrasound, and compare the quality of their sperm with that of patients in a control group with nor-mal <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> exam. Materials and methods: We performed 277 consecutive <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> examinations from January 2012 to July 2012. Among all these, we selected 86 patients that showed no pathological elements at echography and 11 patients affected by MT, to one or both testicles. Each patient was also submitted to a short-term semen analysis using the WHO 2010 parameters for sperm evaluation. Results: Among 11 patients with MT, 7 (63. 63 %) were dyspermic and 4 (36. 36 %) were normospermic. Among the 86 patients with normal <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> 51 (59. 3 %) were dyspermic, 4 (4. 65 %) were azoospermic, while the remaining 31 (36. 05 %) were normospermic.

40|$|Intraoperative {{ultrasound}} localization of the non palpable testicular lesions allows {{to detect}} small gonadal tumors or to well study benign testicular masses. Several {{methods have been}} proposed to study non palpable testicular masses including CT and NMR. Prospective studies of the efficacy of CT vs spermatic venography in localization of cryptorchid testes have also been reported: spermatic venography {{proved to be the}} most accurate of the two modalities even if possible neoplastic degeneration of testicular tissue is very difficult to investigate with this method. Herein we describe our clinical experience and particularly four cases in which we adopted intraoperative ultrasonography of testes with different results. M. S. a 28 year old infertile patient underwent <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> during a check-up and a little image localized at the level of right testis was found. Even if no mass was palpable we decided to operate on the patient; an intraoperative <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> revealed the precise localization so that the little mass was excised and examined at once. Histologic study confirmed the presence of tumoral tissue and orchiectomy was performed: deeper hystological studies confirmed it was a leydigioma. D.

40|$|Introduction. Liposarcomas are {{malignant}} tumors {{derived from}} fat tissues. Liposarcoma of the paratesticular tissue is rare. Case report. We presented a 51 -year-old man with liposarcoma of paratesticular tissue and the spermatic cord, mimicking a <b>testicular</b> tumor. <b>Ultrasound</b> examination of this scrotal mass was hyperechogenic and homogeneous and {{separated from the}} testis and epididymis. The patient was operated, and the orchidectomy was performed. Histology revealed well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma of the paratesticular tissue and spermatic cord. After a 6 month follow-up the patient did not show any evidence of tumor-progression or recurrence. Conclusion. Liposarcomas of the paratesticular tissue and seminal cord represent a rare type of tumors, often misdiagnosed preoperatively. Therapy should include radical surgical excision, usually radical inguinal orchiectomy. If the margin status is in doubt, adjuvant radiation should be performed. Local relapse is common and may occur after several years, so follow- up period has to be sufficiently long...|$|R

40|$|Background: Whether extragonadal {{germ cell}} tumors develop {{primarily}} in the retroperitoneum or whether they are essentially metastases of a primary testicular tumor has long been debated and remains controversial. Patients and methods: Three patients presenting with apparent primary extragonadal retroperitoneal germ cell tumors are reported. Ipsilateral testicular evaluation was extended with palpation, ultrasonography and finally histological examination. Results: The retroperitoneal extragonadal tumors were found during abdominal MSCT It was a fortuitous finding in the two first patients. The third patient presented with abdominal pain attributed to necrosis of the large mass which was subsequently firstly drained through endoscopic ultrasound-guided transduodenal puncture. The seminomatous nature of the retroperitoneal tumors was obtained through transduodenal echoendoscopic-guided cytopuncture in the first case, celioscopic resection in the second case and delayed percutaneous CT guided biopsy in the third symptomatic case. The first two patients {{had a history of}} cryptorchidism with substantial clinical testicular atrophy; ultrasonography showed microlithiasis and a small intratesticular tumor in the first patient and an hypoechoic but rather homogeneous atrophic testis in the other; orchiectomy confirmed small seminomatous intratesticular tumors in the two cases. The third patient had an atypical hypoechoic area on <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and histopatholgy revealed a burn-out primary tumor. Conclusions: So-called primary extragonadal retroperitoneal germ cell tumors are extremely rare and should first be considered as metastases of a viable or burned-out testicular cancer until proven otherwise. All ipsilateral testicular abnormalities revealed by the patient's history, clinical examination and mostly by <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> must be treated adequately with orchiectomy because they may act as a sanctuary for later tumor growth...|$|E
40|$|Testicular {{germ cell}} tumours (TGCT) cluster in families, but {{responsible}} genes remain unidentified. The association between testicular microlithiasis (TM) and testicular {{carcinoma in situ}} (CIS) suggests that TM may be a TC risk factor. We report <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> findings in men with familial TGCT (FTGCT) and their unaffected relatives. A total of 81 men (48 affected and 33 unaffected) from 31 families with ⩾ 2 TC cases underwent <b>testicular</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> Testicular microlithiasis was defined as either ‘classic' (⩾ 5 microliths) or ‘limited' (< 5 microliths). Statistical analyses used Fisher's exact test and permutation testing. Testicular microlithiasis was more frequent in the contralateral testicles of men {{with a history of}} TGCT (affected men) than in unaffected men (48 vs 24 %, P= 0. 04). The association appeared stronger for classic TM (21 vs 9 %) than for limited TM (27 vs 15 %). Testicular microlithiases were bilateral in six out of seven (87 %) unaffected men. Among affected men, TM was not associated with histology, age at diagnosis or cancer treatment. Of the 31 families, 10 accounted for a majority (61 %) of the TM cases identified (P= 0. 11). Testicular microlithiasis was more prevalent among FTGCT family members than described previously in the general population, and was more common among FTGCT cases vs unaffected blood relatives. Testicular microlithiasis appeared to cluster in certain families. These findings suggest both a familial predisposition to TM and an association between TM and FTGCT. If proven, this could be clinically important to men in FTGCT families, and may be useful in identifying specific genes involved in FTGCT...|$|E
