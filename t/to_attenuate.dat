40|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{is an important}} psychological concept {{that has been used}} extensively to better understand cognition and emotion. This review focuses on neural systems involved in approach, avoidance, and conflict decision making, and how these systems overlap with implicated neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In particular, the role of amygdala, insula, ventral striatal, and prefrontal regions are discussed with respect to approach and avoidance behaviors. Three specific hypotheses underlying the dysfunction in anxiety disorders are proposed, including: (i) over-representation of avoidance valuation related to limbic overactivation; (ii) under- or over-representation of approach valuation related <b>to</b> <b>attenuated</b> or exaggerated striatal activation respectively; and (iii) insufficient integration and arbitration of approach and avoidance valuations related <b>to</b> <b>attenuated</b> orbitofrontal cortex activation. These dysfunctions can be examined experimentally using versions of existing decision-making paradigms, but may also require new translational and innovative approaches to probe approach-avoidance conflict and related neural systems in anxiety disorders...|$|R

25|$|Another {{approach}} to DNA vaccination is expression library immunization (ELI).

Even partial expression libraries can induce protection from subsequent challenge.|$|E
25|$|Included in Pier 3 is the sound-attenuating {{hill that}} {{separates}} the stretch of park from the noisy Brooklyn-Queens Expressway cantilevered over Furman Street. <b>To</b> <b>attenuate</b> the noise, the park's design includes 20- to 30-foot high hills between Piers 2–5. This hill runs along {{the entire length of}} the Greenway Terrace and reduces noise pollution in the park up to 75 percent, from 75 decibels to 68 decibels. This hill is formed by salvaged material from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's East Side Access project in Midtown Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. (See corrective lens, contact lens, eyeglasses.) Most lenses used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; eyeglass lenses are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to fit in a roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be axially symmetric to correct for astigmatism. Sunglasses' lenses are designed <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|E

50|$|VLPs {{are useful}} as vaccines. VLPs contain repetitive, high density {{displays}} of viral surface proteins that present conformational viral epitopes that can elicit strong T cell and B cell immune responses. Since VLPs cannot replicate, {{they provide a}} safer alternative <b>to</b> <b>attenuated</b> viruses. VLPs were used to develop FDA-approved vaccines for Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus. More recently, VLPs were used to develop a pre-clinical vaccine against chikungunya virus.|$|R
50|$|Proposed {{views on}} {{extinction}} cues {{suggest that they}} reduce {{the degree to which}} the test condition matches conditioning. It is not that the extinction cue necessarily disrupts response performance via inhibition, but rather, the extinction cue functions to retrieve a memory of extinction. Such an extinction memory is that in which the CS and US are not related and as such, spontaneous recovery of the response prior <b>to</b> extinction is <b>attenuated.</b> Spontaneous recovery would successfully occur if the subject failed to retrieve an extinction memory upon being presented with the extinction cue; however, it is usually observed that presenting an extinction cue leads <b>to</b> <b>attenuated</b> spontaneous recovery.|$|R
25|$|Priority Ducking is used {{to lower}} {{the level of a}} microphone(s) and/or program {{material}} based on a source signal from another microphone, {{for the duration of the}} signal present at the source microphone. It restores the original level once the source signal has ceased. This is useful when a) program material needs <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> in order to accentuate the voice of a narrator, b) one microphone is used by a chairman or master of ceremonies, and needs to have priority over other mics and/or program material, or c) a paging mic must attenuate all other signals.|$|E
25|$|For {{external}} exposure, bathing the {{mucous membrane}} surfaces that have contacted capsaicin with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), creams, or polyethylene glycol {{is the most}} effective way <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> the associated discomfort; since oil and capsaicin are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the capsaicin that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin, as are bleach, sodium metabisulfite and topical antacid suspensions. Capsaicin is soluble in alcohol, which can be used to clean contaminated items.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy has been limited to relatively small proteins or protein domains. This is in part caused by problems resolving overlapping peaks in larger proteins, but this has been alleviated {{by the introduction of}} isotope labelling and multidimensional experiments. Another more serious problem is the fact that in large proteins the magnetization relaxes faster, which means there is less time to detect the signal. This in turn causes the peaks to become broader and weaker, and eventually disappear. Two techniques have been introduced <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> the relaxation: transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) and deuteration of proteins. By using these techniques it has been possible to study proteins in complex with the 900 kDa chaperone GroES-GroEL.|$|E
50|$|A {{preselector}} can be engineered so that {{in addition}} <b>to</b> <b>attenuating</b> interference from unwanted frequencies, it will limit input signal voltage to protect a sensitive receiver from damage caused by static discharge, nearby voltage spikes, and overload from nearby transmitters’ signals. It can also incorporate a small radio frequency amplifier stage to boost the filtered signal, although pre-amplification typically isn’t needed. None of these extra conveniences is {{a necessary part of}} preselection.|$|R
30|$|As the lesions {{started to}} heal, they became well defined and {{acquired}} a thin border of hypoautofluorescence while remaining predominant hyperautofluorescent centrally. The SD-OCT scan through the hyperautofluorescent area showed {{disappearance of the}} hyperreflective fuzzy areas that were replaced by irregular, hyperreflective knobbly elevations of the outer retinal layers. The RPE, the POST, IS/OS junction, and the ELM could not be distinguished. The ONL appeared normal. At this stage, there was an increased reflectance from the choroidal layers due <b>to</b> <b>attenuating</b> RPE–photoreceptor complex.|$|R
30|$|Li {{proposed}} an approach <b>to</b> <b>attenuating</b> {{the influence of}} the high-frequency components on the estimated SPNs [22]. Li’s method improved the accuracy of the source camera identification by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the test SPN components. However, this method was designed for the source digital camera identification using fine quality of reference SPN. Furthermore, two different SPNs still can be correlated after Li’s method is applied if they have correlated high-frequency components in the same position.|$|R
25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and many other things. In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E
25|$|Reza Shah {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> {{the power}} of the colonial forces in Iran and was successful to a large extent. However, he also needed them to help modernize the country. He did so by balancing the influence of various colonial powers, including that of Britain and Germany. In the 1930s, Reza Shah tried to terminate the APOC concession that the Qajar dynasty had granted, but Iran was still weak and Britain would not allow it. The concession was renegotiated on terms again favorable to the British (although the D'Arcy Concession was softened). On 21 March 1935, Reza Shah changed the name of the country from Persia to Iran. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was then renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC).|$|E
25|$|In such circumstances, {{efforts were}} mainly {{directed}} towards the old programme of 'rehabilitating Palestine'. Goldmann {{called for an}} extraordinary Zionist conference in 1942 to form a cohesive strategy <b>to</b> <b>attenuate</b> the devastating effects of Nazi policies on European Jews, and the outcome was the Biltmore Program, which called for, among other things, unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine. In his address to the conference, Goldmann warned that Nazi rhetoric was to be taken seriously, {{and that there were}} foreseeable genocidal consequences for European Jews, were the Nazis to press on with their policies. At the May 1943 American Emergency Committee meeting, Goldmann, along with Abba Hillel Silver, was an advocate of the rationale that the struggle against the MacDonald White Paper was a step in the establishment of the Jewish commonwealth.|$|E

They are especially suited to non-stationary sources...|$|R
