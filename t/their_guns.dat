5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> {{and began to}} pour cannon fire into {{the rear of the}} 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
5|$|After World War II two of Frunzes turrets and <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> {{were used}} to rebuild Coast Defense Battery 30 (Maksim Gor'kii I) in Sevastopol. It {{remained}} in service with the Soviet Navy through 1997.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,000 Royalist {{soldiers}} had been killed, {{many in the}} last stand of the whitecoats, and 1,500 captured, including Lucas and Tillier. The Royalists lost all <b>their</b> <b>guns,</b> with many hundreds of weapons and several standards also falling {{into the hands of}} the allied forces.|$|E
50|$|Remington prices their STS/Nitro family {{higher than}} <b>their</b> <b>Gun</b> Club line of shells. Federal prices their Gold Medal and Federal Paper shells higher than <b>their</b> Top <b>Gun</b> or Estate lines. The {{quality of the}} hull construction, shot, powder and primer {{components}} impacts the price of shotshells.|$|R
50|$|Wolf Fang is {{an unusual}} {{scrolling}} horizontal shooter; because the players control a mech, the players can hover against slanted walls in the back ground and occasionally land on higher platforms. Players are set with controls similar to a platformer as they face whichever horizontal direction they choose, can duck, aim <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> upwards by a 45 degree angle and jump. Players can also move and aim <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> in different directions by holding a certain button down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite that, captain; {{and they}} must have given <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> a lot of {{elevation}} to carry so far. I almost wonder they wasted their powder." ...|$|R
5|$|Artillerymen wore similar {{clothing}} to the cavalry: mostly black in colour with a koller and black trousers. They were additionally {{equipped with a}} standard hussar sword should they have need to defend <b>their</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
5|$|George Sanders as Shere Khan, an {{intelligent}} and sophisticated yet merciless Bengal tiger who hates all humans {{for fear of}} <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> and fire and wants to kill Mowgli.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit. If {{an enemy}} fleet ran, then the Invincibles would use their speed to pursue, and <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> to damage or slow enemy ships.|$|E
5000|$|Styracosaurus: chases Charlie, Englehorn, and Helstrom into a {{cave and}} destroys <b>their</b> <b>gun.</b> Same model {{used in the}} {{original}} film. Escaped when the island sank (offscreen).|$|R
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} spoken when bang! something hit {{the armor}} plate directly under <b>their</b> <b>gun,</b> hurling the gunner, Walter, {{and several others}} back by the shock.|$|R
50|$|In {{shooting}} sports, {{a shorter}} shooter can maintain better balance when standing {{for long periods}} of time holding a gun, as well as keep <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> steady.|$|R
5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns. The two controlling the port-side guns were adjacent to <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> while the starboard {{directors were}} mounted fore and aft on the island. They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.|$|E
5|$|The 30,000 Austrians and <b>their</b> 100 <b>guns</b> {{were opposed}} by 22,000 French and <b>their</b> 15 <b>guns.</b> Meanwhile, after {{the arrival of}} Desaix, 6,000 men would {{reinforce}} Bonaparte's army.|$|R
5000|$|Some U.S. states, {{the first}} of which was Florida, have enacted {{so-called}} [...] "physician gag laws" [...] limiting doctors' ability to talk to their patients about <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> ownership.|$|R
50|$|During {{an attack}} by an Me 110 fighter, the {{children}} fire <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> at the plane. They miss but the plane is shot down. The pilot is killed but the rear gunner, Rudi Gerlath, bails out. He discovers the children's hidden fortress and is promptly detained by the children, who take his pistol, even though <b>their</b> machine <b>gun</b> is damaged and inoperable.|$|R
5|$|In case of B license {{the person}} is allowed to use <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> at {{shooting}} ranges. The C license is required by other laws for hunting. The E license allows the person to own a gun for self-defense purpose and carry the concealed weapon. All guns need to be registered with the police in 10 working days after buying except for the D category.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with <b>their</b> <b>guns,</b> {{and most of the}} gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law. Annually, police investigate about 500 cases of illegal arming (with or without direct connection to committing other crime).|$|E
5|$|She {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> on the target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot {{the fall of the}} shells.|$|E
60|$|Sherikov blanched. His mouth fell open. The police {{moved quickly}} around him, <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> tubes up, jabbing into him. He was searched rapidly, efficiently. His gun belt and {{concealed}} energy screen were yanked off.|$|R
5000|$|As {{they see}} action, one gun crew is puzzled to {{discover}} <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> is missing after being fired. It's gone over a cliff, and narrowly avoids killing future Goon Harry Secombe, whom Milligan later meets in passing: ...|$|R
5000|$|.....took him in custody, {{striking}} {{him several}} times with <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> butts for moving too slowly. After days in a Cripple Creek bullpen, he and seventy-seven others were put on a train and deported to neighboring Kansas...|$|R
5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Both Boadicea and Bellona {{began their}} careers with {{destroyer}} flotillas of the First Fleet, Boadicea as senior officers' ship for the 1st Destroyer Flotilla and Bellona with the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. The former {{was transferred to}} the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in mid-1912 and the sisters were transferred to the 2nd and the 1st Battle Squadrons, respectively, of the First Fleet in 1913. Both ships were assigned to positions at the rear of their squadrons and did not fire <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.|$|E
5|$|Dupuy de Lôme was {{designed}} to fill the commerce-raiding strategy of the Jeune École. Considered by some the first true armoured cruiser, she was superior to existing British and Italian protected cruisers, especially in her relatively thick steel armour. She could control the engagement range with her superior speed and her heavy armament of quick-firing guns, {{all of which were}} mounted in gun turrets, in marked contrast to her intended opponents who mounted <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> in lightly protected casemates or pivot mounts.|$|E
50|$|These are {{missions}} {{which require}} the player {{to engage in}} air combat against enemy fighters, a Zeppelin, and ground anti-aircraft guns, depending on the mission. The player flies in third-person while shooting <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> at targets ahead.|$|R
50|$|The Sailing frigate {{classification}} system {{used during the}} 19th Century was a classification scheme used in several western countries. It was officially adopted by the United States Navy. The system classified sailing frigates according to <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> rating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I reckon {{we are in}} fer it!" [...] ejaculated Luke, as he and {{the youth}} rushed over to <b>their</b> <b>gun.</b> [...] "Larry, it's in my mind we have some tall work cut out fer us this trip!" ...|$|R
5|$|Following Germany's capitulation, the Allies {{demanded that}} the {{majority}} of the High Seas Fleet be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. On 21 November 1918, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, the ships sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Once the ships were interned, their breech blocks were removed, which disabled <b>their</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} interview, Earp claimed that George Hoyt had {{intended}} to kill him, although newspaper accounts from that time report differently. He also said he and Bat Masterson had confronted Clay Allison when {{he was sent to}} Dodge City to finish George Hoyt's job, and that they had forced him to back down. Two other accounts contradicted Earp, crediting cattleman Dick McNulty and Long Branch Saloon owner Chalk Beeson with convincing Allison and his cowboys to surrender <b>their</b> <b>guns.</b> Cowboy Charlie Siringo witnessed the incident and left a written account.|$|E
5|$|Jiyuan then {{travelled}} back to Port Arthur, {{where the}} foreign engineer refused {{to serve the}} captain of the vessel any longer, and left. Captain Fang Peh-Kien was executed for his actions in the battle, with command passed to First Lieutenant Huang Tsu-Lien. Of the surviving Chinese warships from the battle, the Jiyuan was the least damaged. As the other surviving ships from the battle arrived in Port Arthur, <b>their</b> <b>guns</b> were dressed in red. Jiyuan was the exception, with no decoration and was docked away from the other vessels.|$|E
25|$|Headphones {{are also}} useful for video games that use 3D {{positional}} audio processing algorithms, as they allow players to better judge {{the position of}} an off-screen sound source (such as the footsteps of an opponent or <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> fire).|$|R
50|$|Ten British {{sailors and}} marines are buried {{on the islands}} {{including}} two sailors from HMS Albatross {{who were killed in}} March 1886 when <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> exploded, and a young sailor, Alex Wood from HMS Albion, who died in 1903.|$|R
500|$|Air gunners are {{encouraged}} to perform shooting group tests with <b>their</b> <b>gun</b> clamped in a machine rest to establish which particular match pellet type performs best for <b>their</b> particular air <b>gun.</b> To facilitate maximum performance out of various air guns the leading match pellet manufacturers produce pellets with graduated [...] "head sizes", which means the pellets are offered with front diameters from 4.48mm up to 4.51mm.|$|R
