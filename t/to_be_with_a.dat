5|$|Disney had {{originally}} conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> British prince. However, director Tony Bancroft, who {{was inspired by}} the well-being of his own daughters, wanted Mulan to be a different, unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent, whose fate does not depend upon a male character. Thus, the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot, while Mulan's bravery and strength were emphasized {{in order to ensure that}} she remained the hero of her own story. Mulan's supervising animator was Mark Henn, who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Mulan was {{originally}} conceived as an animated short in 1994, {{in which the}} heroine is depicted as a miserable Chinese girl who elopes to the West <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> British prince. While developing a series of treatments based on traditional stories and folk tales, children's book author Robert D. San Souci discovered the Ballad of Mulan, an ancient Chinese poem about Hua Mulan – a Chinese woman who replaces her ailing father in the army by disguising herself as a man. Fascinated by Hua Mulan's story, San Souci suggested the poem to Disney; the studio hired San Souci himself to write the film's treatment and story.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> younger woman, but all go about it in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E

We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E

He soon became a regular starter and scored in half the games he played in for the club. Odubade was released by Eastleigh in September 2016 following the appointment of Ronnie Moore as manager.|$|E

Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld’s winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, [...] or Robertson Island. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands {{they would be able to}} reach and cross Graham Land, and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{focuses on the}} yearning desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loved one for Christmas, {{regardless}} of whether they have to forgo the usual commercial aspect of the holiday season such as ornamental lights, trees, snow and presents. The song incorporates various instruments, including piano, drums, violin, oboe, flute, bell chimes, bass effect, and cowbells. The song layers background vocals throughout the chorus and sections of the bridge. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is set in common time and in the key of G major. Carey's vocal range in the song spans from the note of G3 to the high note of G5. Carey wrote the song's lyrics and melody, while Afanasieff arranged and produced the piece with synthetically created computerized equipment. Slates Ragusea counts [...] "at least 13 distinct chords at work, resulting in a sumptuously chromatic melody. The song also includes what I consider the most Christmassy chord of all—a minor subdominant, or 'iv,' chord with an added 6, under the words 'underneath the Christmas tree,' among other places. (You might also analyze it as a half-diminished 'ii' 7th chord, but either interpretation seems accurate)." [...] According to Roch Parisien from AllMusic, the song contains [...] "The Beach Boys-style harmonies, jangling bells, and a sleigh-ride pace, injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set." [...] In a piece on the song in Vogue, a writer felt the song's lyrics helped solidify its status over two decades later: [...] "those lyrics could have been sung by Frank Sinatra—well, maybe not Frank, but another singer back then.
