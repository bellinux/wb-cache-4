40|$|Tradable {{emission}} permits may {{be considered}} as a policy instrument that gives incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost efficient way. Due to transaction costs it may not be cost efficient to include sectors in which there are many small emission sources. One example of a sector that could be considered as made up of many small emission sources is the household or residential sector. If the residential sector is not included in a <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system but the power or district-heating sector is included some technologies for residential heating, like heat pumps and district heating are affected since fuel for production of electricity to heat pumps and fuel for district heating are used in the trading sector while the heat is used in the residential sector. In this study, the implications for carbon dioxide emissions from heat pumps in households of a <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system where power producers but not households are obligated to have emission permits are discussed. The results indicates that when considering how actors in the emission permit market are affected by measures in the household lead to different conclusions regarding greenhouse gas emissions compared to a system where there is no emissions trading...|$|E

40|$|Unexpected {{variation}} in emissions {{can have a}} substantial impact on the prices and efficiency of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> markets. In this paper we report results from a laboratory experiment in which subjects participate in an emissions trading market {{in the presence of}} emissions uncertainty. Subjects face exogenous, random positive or negative shocks to their emission levels after they make production and emission control plans. In some sessions we allow subjects to bank their unused permits for future use. In all sessions, subjects can trade in a reconciliation period to buy or sell extra permits following the shock realization. Subjects then report their emissions to the regulatory authority and they are placed in different inspection groups depending on their compliance history. The design of our experiment allows us to identify important interactions between emission shocks, banking, compliance and enforcement. We find that the relationship between emission shocks and price changes is significantly stronger without banking, so banking helps smooth out the price variability arising from the imperfect control of emissions. This greater price stability comes at a cost, however, since noncompliance and emissions are significantly greater when banking is allowed.

However, when emissions are difficult to monitor and verify, offset credits from pollution reductions {{may be subject to}} price discounts that reduce social welfare. In this paper, we estimate the extent to which social welfare could be improved by using new technology to increase the accuracy with which pollution flows from agricultural fields can be monitored. We use a hypothetical case study of a situation in which farmers can reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from Midwest agricultural land parcels and sell the resulting offset permits in a greenhouse gas tradable permit market. We simulate market outcomes with and without an inexpensive technology that increases the accuracy of emission estimates, reduces the discount to which agricultural offset permits are subject, and improves the performance of tradable permit system. We find that the benefits from such technology range as high as $ 138 for a 100 acre field if N 2 O emissions are an exponential function of nitrogen application rates. However, variation in the benefits to farmers of eliminating price discounts may mean efficient technology adoption is not uniform across space. tradable permit, greenhouse gases, uncertainty, technology...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} a) a domestic carbon tax policy, and, b) participation in a global <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> regime on carbon emissions, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and poverty, in India. The results, based a computable general equilibrium model of the Indian economy, show that a carbon tax policy that simply recycles carbon tax revenues to households imposes heavy costs in terms of lower economic growth and higher poverty. However, the fall in GDP and rise in poverty can be minimized or even prevented if the emission restriction target is a very mild one and tax revenues are transferred to the poor. A soft emission reduction target is all that India needs to set for itself, given that even a ten percent annual reduction in aggregate emissions will bring down its per capita emissions to a level far below global per capita emissions. On the other hand, participation in the <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> regime opens up an opportunity for India to sell surplus permits.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We compare three {{different}} {{views on the}} long run efficiencies of emission taxes which include thresholds, and of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> where some permits are initially free. The differences are caused by different assumptions about whether thresholds and free permits should be subsidies given only to firms that produce, or full property rights.

Such flexibility could be very important in achieving efficent control of Do <b>emission</b> taxes and <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> have the same long run efficiency properties?

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a computable general {{equilibrium}} model of the Indian economy, shows that a domestic carbon tax policy that recycles carbon tax revenues to households imposes heavy costs in terms of lower economic growth and higher poverty.

India's participation in an internationally <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> regime with grandfathered emissions allocation is preferable to any domestic carbon tax option, provided the world market price of <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> remains low.

40|$|A {{critical}} issue in designing {{a system of}} <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> concerns {{the distribution of the}} initial pollution rights. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate how the initial rights should be optimally set, when the determination of the number of tradable permits is subject to the influence of interest groups. According to the Coase theorem, in the case where there are low transaction costs, the assignment of the initial rights does not affect the efficiency of the final resource allocation. In the presence of political pressure, we show that the distribution of the initial rights has a significant effect on social welfare. In contrast to the conventional results, we find that grandfathered permits may be more efficient than auctioned permits, even after taking into consideration the revenue-recycling effect.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that Weitzman’s policy rule for {{choosing}} price- versus quantity-based pollution control instruments under uncertainty is biased when the polluting firms possess market power (Heuson 2010).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} challenges facing the United States is how to protect the atmosphere that sustains human life and safeguard the economy that ensures human livelihood. To meet this challenge, policymakers and others rightly advocate for using market-based mech-anisms, such as <b>tradable</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>permits,</b> to combat cli-mate change. However, not all market mechanisms are created equal. Some involve giving away “rights ” to emit greenhouse gases, which would unnecessarily raise the costs of climate protection. In fact, 2, 500 economists, in-cluding eight Nobel laureates, state that market mecha-nisms, such as auctioned <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> or carbon taxes minimizes the costs of climate protection. 1 To obtain the full economic benefits of market mechanisms, policymakers must charge emitters for their greenhouse gas emissions and return the revenue to the U. S. economy. This paper expands on one of three arguments sum-marized in “Fair and Low-Cost Climate Protection” (Redefining Progress 1999). 2 It explains why charging pol-luters and returning the revenue to citizens and investors improves economic well-being—by giving firms flexibility to meet their environmental obligations, reducing the im-pact of higher fossil fuel prices on the economy, and avoiding costly battles among firms to obtain free permits...|$|R

The study estimates the economic costs to Canada of six planning scenarios. Four of these scenarios involve the use of <b>tradable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> and two involved a carbon tax. In each case, the mechanism&# 039;s target is to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at some percentage of 1990 levels (100 % or 90 %) by either 2010 or 2015.
