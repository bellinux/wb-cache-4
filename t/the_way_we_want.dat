500|$|Vazgen Sargsyan's other brother, Armen, {{supported}} Serzh Sargsyan in the 2013 presidential election. On 5 March 2013, Aram Sargsyan {{was asked}} about his brother's political stance, to which he responded, [...] "I {{would very much like}} to ask Vazgen that question. I don't know what he would have answered. I don't know Vazgen's answers to very few questions. Unfortunately, our friends and relatives are not always <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them to be. I am not the first one, neither am I the last one; {{the history of the world}} is full of such examples starting from the Bible." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, Pekka had {{recorded}} vocals for five tracks, which Antti described as [...] "very raw ... <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them to be". Pekka's vocals {{would continue to be}} recorded in August, and he completed them on August 20. Antti had also completed his guitar solos by June and was pleased with the results. [...] "For me, the solos are [...] best that I have ever managed to create, and I'm very satisfied." [...] After a summer break, the band returned to record Sneck's keyboards, which took place over three days, August 17–19. Sneck worked with software effects for the first time, along with sound modules. He introduced synthesized horns to the band's instrumentation, but an actual trumpet was used for the intro to [...] "Rust Never Sleeps".|$|E

6000|$|... "Might as {{well let}} them have their fling," [...] he said, after the others had departed. [...] "That's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it before <b>we</b> were married;" [...] and he gave his wife a hug and a kiss.|$|R
5000|$|... "Everything went perfectly, {{starting}} {{with all the}} speed up front," [...] said Curlin's jockey Robby Albarado. [...] "It unfolded just <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted,</b> but it also takes {{a hell of a}} horse to get this done. Curlin was there for us every step of the way." ...|$|R
50|$|Normally {{we start}} with a riff from Joe, and then we add drums {{sometimes}} with a machine, then I start writing lyrics, then we all start jamming on the song. It took us about one year to make so we could make sure it sounded <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to sound. Actually, we’re already writing a new record (laughs).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} see about that presently. I don't think we shall be able to lay our course beyond the Whittaker. To lay our course means to steer <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go; and if we can't do that we shall have to beat, and that is tedious work with a light wind like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't speak Dutch," [...] said Rollo to the boatman, [...] "but that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go." [...] So saying, Rollo {{pointed in}} the {{direction}} which led towards the station. The man did not understand a word that Rollo had said; but still, by hearing it, he learned the fact that Rollo did not speak {{the language of the}} country, and by his signs he knew that he must go the way that he pointed. So he began to row the boat along.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a few minutes, a lift {{will bring}} {{something}} {{down to us}} from the surface," [...] he explained. [...] "You see, Taylor, {{every once in a while}} Security examines and interrogates a surface leady, one that has been above for a time, to find out certain things. A vidcall is sent up and contact is made with a field headquarters. We need this direct interview; we can't depend on vidscreen contact alone. The leadys are doing a good job, but we want to make certain that everything is going <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We were {{a little}} uncomfortable at first about using {{slightly}} older material, and I think if we'd done the album as a 4 piece, we wouldn't have used them. Having Dan join the band really revived those songs though, the arrangements have been bettered. We can now obviously do the songs justice with Dan's voice, they now sound <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> them to sound before, and <b>we</b> definitely <b>want</b> more people to hear them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're going just <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> don't <b>want</b> to go," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "and I {{guess the}} best {{thing we can do is}} to get to land before we're carried any farther." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} {{difficult for the}} band, not the least because Placebo chose Phil Vinall to replace Steve Osborne as producer {{at the last minute}} to produce [...] "Pure Morning". Later on, Placebo's frontman Brian Molko stated that, despite appreciating Osborne's producing skills, the chemistry between band and producer [...] "didn't spark <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to spark", also adding that the album was [...] "overproduced" [...] and contained [...] "too many slow songs for a second album". That said, he did not disown the album, adding that it is still a record the band is proud of.|$|R
6000|$|... "The moon will be down in {{a couple}} of hours," [...] Ned said; [...] "but by that time we shall be beyond where any sentries are likely to have been placed on the road, so we can then trust {{ourselves}} on that till it begins to get daylight. We must keep in the fields till we are past Nussara, which is five miles by the road; then we can walk straight on. There is a nullah a few yards on; we had better keep in that for a quarter of a mile; it does not go quite <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> but it will be safer to follow it till we are well out of sight of any one who may be watching the plain." ...|$|E

5000|$|Patricia Morrison: [...] "We {{want to get}} {{out with}} the next record, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to present {{ourselves}} live is going to take quite a lot of effort and time. And we'd rather get another record under our belts before we attempt that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You addle-pated, insolent clown, {{to dispute}} terms with gentlemen in His Majesty's service. Stand aside. I've done you only too much honour by parleying with you. Out of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> don't <b>want</b> {{to take a}} stick of your own trumpery, I say." ...|$|R
5000|$|Randy McDonald was {{in charge}} of art direction, design, and {{production}} for Cinemaware's first four games, and he explains in an interview that [...] "Peter Greene or I would do a sketch of generally what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> for each cover. I went to Western Costume in Hollywood, which for many decades was the giant in the costume industry there, and rented costumes for the types of [...] "look" [...] we had settled on for each cover. We hired models and brought them into Peter’s large photo studio, where we set them up in the costumes I had rented, posed as closely as possible to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> them to be illustrated." ...|$|R
5000|$|Volume 2 (Breaking Through) is {{the third}} album by the American {{psychedelic}} rock group, the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, and was released in 1967 on Reprise Records (R 6270 mono, RS 6270 stereo). At the time of recording, Michael Lloyd was not present so the group was reduced to Bob Markley, the Harris brothers, and uncredited contributions of Ron Morgan. On the back of original LP release appears 'Breaking Through' and the declaration: [...] "Every song in this album has been written, arranged, sung and played by the group. No one censored us. We got to say everything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to say, in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to say it".|$|R
5000|$|... "But I am {{not afraid}} to {{consider}} the final question as to whether, ultimately - in the great future - we can arrange the atoms the way we want; the very atoms, all the way down! What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them ...|$|E
5000|$|On the {{importance}} of the re-launching the [...] "Syria Times" [...] e-newspaper, Minister al-Zou'bi said: [...] "We are in need for new tools to communicate with English-speaking communities, as to address the people of these communities and present our views and causes the way they understand, and not <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Madraiwiwi {{spoke of}} the need to build {{personal}} relationships on the basis of trust, across ethnic lines. [...] "We must begin to trust each other if this country is to progress <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it to. But before that we have to lay the preparatory work to engender that trust by building relationships every day," [...] he declared.|$|E
5000|$|... “The racing gods {{want to make}} it {{difficult}} on us,” Truex said in victory lane. “Man, this feels good. I’m a lucky guy to be able to drive this black 78. (Crew chief) Cole Pearn, Jazzy (Team Engineer Jeff Curtis), everybody on this team, the pit crew, Barney (Team Owner Visser) for giving us everything we need. This is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to start <b>the</b> Chase. It feels awesome.” “On one hand the bad luck was going to bite us and on the other {{we had a lot of}} time to battle back,” he added. “We’re lucky it happened early and we were able to have an awesome racecar all day.” ...|$|R
500|$|The Giants {{started the}} season with a 27–20 home win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out {{training}} camp and the preseason in a contract dispute, linebacker Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble. The Giants' defense forced three turnovers and held the Eagles to 83 rushing yards. The Giants' offense scored three touchdowns in a 13-minute span in the third and early fourth quarters, but head coach Bill Parcells felt the offensive performance was lackluster overall: [...] "Our runners didn't run <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> them to. They were a little impatient. There were five or six vivid examples of cutting back too soon. You just have to give the play a chance and let it go where it's supposed to." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon release, Cole told Susan Jarvis of Capital News “We really {{planned this}} album, and it’s turned out exactly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted.</b> I {{had a lot}} to say, so there aren’t so many humorous songs. If you listen to one of the tracks on the album, [...] "The Clown Song", you’ll {{understand}} why. But the overall vibe of the album is incredibly positive.” adding “The other thing we were determined to do was make an album that I could perform live. Every song can be done on stage — the album can be read as a set list, if I want. That hasn’t been possible with my last couple of recordings, so I’m really enjoying that aspect of it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|My budget {{supports}} {{a major new}} National Nanotechnology Initiative, worth $500 million. Caltech {{is no stranger to}} the idea of nanotechnology the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular level. Over 40 years ago, Caltech's own Richard Feynman asked, [...] "What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them?" ...|$|E
50|$|The film {{looks at}} the way we casually live in a class system built on blatant {{economic}} and social disparities, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be fooled by our belief systems, the way we validate our tastes and are also very protective of them. By exploring a counter-point for every point, the film subtly questions not only our material value system but also our emotional value system.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} DreamWorks Animation series, the Netflix deal allowed DreamWorks {{to maintain}} creative control. Prynoski said: [...] "Typically, {{if you are}} working on a show like this, you might get two sets of notes: one from DreamWorks and one from the network. But we don't get notes from Netflix, which is cool. It allows us to move faster, and we can make the shows, hopefully, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{they would}} say, for example, 'Get out of <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> John, quick.' Whereas, {{it would be}} better to say, 'John, you are in <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> where <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to come along.' Some men give their {{directions}} with great noise and vociferation, and others give them quietly and gently." ...|$|R
5000|$|The FA Charity Shield is a match played {{between the}} reigning Premier League Champions and the FA Cup winners one week {{prior to the}} {{commencement}} of the Premier League campaign. However, Manchester United completed a domestic double the previous season and on 14 May 1996 the FA voted to invite Newcastle, rather than FA Cup beaten finalists Liverpool, to play against the Champions at Wembley. The invitation was accepted on 22 May, with Newcastle defender Steve Watson telling the press: [...] "It's brilliant news...It's not <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to qualify for the}} Charity Shield [...] - [...] <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to get there by winning the League. But it will be a great day for our fans and gives us a real lift {{before the start of the}} season." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wilder was {{disappointed}} with the completed film. [...] "Maybe we went overboard {{with some of the}} comic relief, because Avanti! is not a comedy", he stated. [...] "If this film had worked <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to, it would have had more of the quality of The Apartment. I always feel sorry for the disappointment of the actors, and all those dear technical people who do so much, when the picture doesn't make it <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they hoped [...] [...] [...] I went much farther with forbidden themes than I had with Kiss Me, Stupid, but nobody cared. Audiences thought it was too long and too bland. I guess they would have liked it better if it turned out the father was having the affair with one of the bellboys at the hotel." ...|$|R
5000|$|During their 2014 tour The Glitch Mob {{performed}} {{with a new}} musical element they called [...] "The Blade." [...] Built by movie set designers, it is a customized, painted set piece that houses both lights and instruments. In an interview with Sound of Boston Josh Mayer explained, [...] "It really represents {{who we are and}} what we’re trying to say, and it’s just a functional thing that lets us play our music <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to play our music." ...|$|E
5000|$|The CID's director, Sue Gartner, {{called the}} {{situation}} an [...] "existential crisis" [...] for the project, as {{it leaves the}} question of enacting the sales tax up to a single voter, adding [...] "It's the law. It's legal. But we're not sure it's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go." [...] Henderson says that Gartner approached her in June {{to ask her to}} withdraw her voting registration, but she refused, describing this as [...] "manipulative" [...] and citing concerns about taxing the food and necessities of low-income people.|$|E

50|$|Chubb {{was sure}} that God heard all our petitionary prayers, {{but he did not}} think God {{answered}} all of them in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> him to. God answered only some of our prayers, and only if they were for lawful things and we prayed earnestly “with a modest resignation to God’s will.”vi Chubb thought that God sometimes gave us harmful things we prayed for, but then God acted “in displeasure.” In another tract, he was more pessimistic about God's positive response rate to our prayers. He cited evidence that God did not often answer our prayers: over the last two hundred years, millions of sincere, fervent prayers had petitioned God for the defeat of the Antichrist, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy or other interests bent on defeating God's kingdom still existed.|$|R
