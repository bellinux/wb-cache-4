5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack.

40|$|The Domestic Violence Intervention Court Model was {{successful}} in achieving some {{but not all of}} its aims.   This study examines whether domestic violence police and court outcomes have changed since the commencement of the Domestic Violence Intervention Court Model (DVICM). Method: Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to determine whether the DVICM resulted in the following: an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> persons of interest charged with a domestic violence offence; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> domestic violence matters finalised on a plea of guilty; a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised on a dismissal; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> penalties of bonds with supervision; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> penalties of imprisonment; a decrease in the time from first court appearance to finalisation in court; an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised with a plea of guilty within three weeks of first court appearance; and an increase in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> matters finalised within 12 weeks of the police event date. The test sites were Campbelltown, Macquarie Fields, and Wagga Wagga Local Area Commands. The rest of NSW was used as the control group. Results: The DVICM increased <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> persons of interest charged in Macquarie Fields but not in Campbelltown or Wagga Wagga Local Area Commands. It reduced the time taken to finalise domestic violence matters in Campbelltown and Wagga Wagga Local Courts.

5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Food {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae are {{important}} in Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other food, including human food litter. There is little competition from other species for food, since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger food items, and may wade in deeper water. When food is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E

5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has a much less developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved.

40|$|Grazing {{management}} practices that allow congregation of cattle near pasture streams may increase sediment, phosphorus, and pathogen loading of the streams by removing vegetation and causing manure accumulation near the streams. Forage sward height, bare and manure-covered soil, and forage species were measured {{along the banks}} of streams in 13 pastures on 12 cow-calf operations in southern Iowa. Forage sward height decreased as <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> tall fescue at the vegetated sites increased, as the stocking rate increased, and as <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> reed canarygrass at the vegetated sites decreased. <b>The</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> soil that was bare tended to increase as <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> reed canarygrass at vegetated sites decreased and <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> tall fescue at vegetated sites or the stocking rate increased. <b>The</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> soil that was manure-covered increased as the stocking rate and <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> tall fescue at vegetated sites increased and <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> reed canarygrass at vegetated sites decreased.

In contrast, stocking rate was the first factor selected to predict <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> soil that was covered with manure. Selection of tall fescue in the stepwise multiple regressions implied that the sward height decreased and manure cover increased as tall fescue as a <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> vegetated sites increased.

5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, {{and found that}} it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E
5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios.
