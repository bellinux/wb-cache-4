5|$|With {{the ship}} unable to {{decrease}} speed below warp 5, and <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> core reaching dangerous levels, Columbia and Commander Tucker rendezvous to provide assistance. However the crew realise that the transporter {{cannot be used}} at warp, so the ships will need to maneuver in close proximity in order for Tucker to be transferred. Captain Archer releases Lieutenant Reed from the brig to perform the transfer. Once on Enterprise, Tucker successfully performs a rapid non-standard cold boot on <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> engine, which purges the Klingon subroutines.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, after Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) is informed {{of the death of}} his former colleague, A. G. Robinson (Keith Carradine), he relates the story of breaking <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> 2.5 barrier to T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) whilst investigating a dark matter nebula.|$|E

5|$|As Cochrane, Riker, and La Forge {{prepare to}} {{activate}} <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> {{drive on the}} Phoenix, Picard confronts the Borg Queen and discovers she has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him an array of new sensations. She has presented this modification {{as a gift to}} the android, hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself in Data's place, the android refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix, but they miss because Data has betrayed her. Data ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive substance fatally dissolves the Borg Queen's biological components.|$|E
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 157 of Njáls saga, a {{man named}} Dörruð {{witnesses}} 12 people riding together to a stone hut on Good Friday in Caithness. The 12 go into the hut and Dörruð can no longer see them. Dörruð goes to the hut, and looks through a chink in the wall. He sees that there are women within, {{and that they have}} set up a particular loom; the heads of men are the weights, the entrails of men are <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> and weft, a sword is the shuttle, and the reels are composed of arrows. The women sing a song called Darraðarljóð, which Dörruð memorizes.|$|E

5|$|Navajo {{textiles}} {{were originally}} utilitarian blankets {{for use as}} cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar purposes. Toward {{the end of the}} 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but with some notable differences. In Navajo weaving, the slit weave technique common in kilims is not used, and <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> is one continuous length of yarn, not extending beyond the weaving as fringe. Traders from the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged adoption of some kilim motifs into Navajo designs.|$|E
5|$|On Columbia, Tucker ruffles a few {{feathers}} {{with his}} new team, and Captain Hernandez asks the reasons behind his transfer. Later, T'Pol and Tucker have a shared vision despite being on different ships. Enterprise locates a destroyed Rigelian ship, and while investigating, they are suddenly attacked and boarded. MACOs repel the attack and a captured alien is taken to Sickbay, where scanners show {{that he is in}} fact Klingon. Archer then discovers Reed's complicity in evidence tampering and confines him to the brig. Archer also learns that the boarders sabotaged the ship, and he orders maximum speed in order to prevent <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> core from overloading. The ship increases speed to , the fastest it has ever been.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek: Enterprise {{follows the}} adventures of {{the crew of the}} {{starship}} Enterprise, designation NX-01. They are the first deep space explorers in Starfleet, using the first Warp 5 equipped vessel. At the start of the series, it is revealed that the Vulcans have withheld advanced technology from humanity since their first contact, concerned that humans were not ready for it. This has delayed human space exploration and caused resentment in Captain Jonathan Archer, whose father developed <b>the</b> <b>Warp</b> 5 engine but did not live to see it used.|$|E

5|$|When Picard {{returns to}} the Enterprise, he discovers that {{survivors}} from the Borg sphere have invaded the ship and are beginning to assimilate both the Enterprise and its crew. Once they have assimilated the ship, the Borg plan {{to use it to}} attack and conquer Earth. Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> core. The assault fails and Data is captured; he meets the Queen of the Borg Collective, who attempts to turn him to her side. A frightened Sloane ambushes the captain, but he soon gains her trust and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck to create a weapon.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted to insert references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} cross section for <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>warped</b> AdS$_ 3 $ black hole background shows that it {{is larger than the}} area even if the s-wave limit is considered. It raises some question whether the deviation from the areal cross section is due to <b>the</b> <b>warped</b> configuration of <b>the</b> geometry or the rotating coordinate system, where these two effects are mixed up in <b>the</b> <b>warped</b> AdS$_ 3 $ black hole. So, we study the low-frequency scattering dynamics of propagating scalar fields under <b>the</b> <b>warped</b> AdS$_ 3 $ background at the critical point which reduces to the BTZ black hole in the rotating frame without <b>the</b> <b>warped</b> factor, which shows that the deformation effect at the critical point does not appear.

5|$|One year later, Crash {{is living}} with his younger sister Coco on N. Sanity Island, one of the islands owned by Cortex in the {{previous}} game. After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through <b>the</b> <b>Warp</b> Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may contain it. After retrieving a gem, Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for world domination. Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 has {{received}} universal acclaim from modern critics who consider the title {{to be one}} of the best games of all time. Edge considered Super Mario Bros. 3 Nintendo's standout title of 1989, and commented that its success outshone the first Super Mario Bros.s sales milestone; the first title sold 40million copies but was bundled with the NES. They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels. Allgame's Skyler Miller praised the game's level design, graphics, music, and nonlinearity. Dengeki referred to the game as a popular title and expressed excitement over its re-release on the Game Boy Advance system. The items hidden in the game's levels, such as <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game's addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction. Both Screw Attack and GamesRadar ranked it the best NES game made. GamesRadar claimed that while Super Mario Bros. defined its genre, Super Mario Bros. 3 perfected it.|$|E

5|$|While the Material Defender recovers in the Red Acropolis {{station on}} Mars, the {{director}} of the team informs him that they have been investigating PTMC, and have uncovered a conspiracy: one of her acquaintances in the PTMC was killed by a robot, and when she contacted PTMC about it, they denied having ever employed such acquaintance, even though he had worked with them for years. The Red Acropolis had tried to notify the Collective Earth Defense (CED), a large police group, of the PTMC's actions, but they took no action, not daring to interfere with such a powerful corporation. The director also tells the Material Defender that, while he was clearing the mines during the events of Descent II, PTMC executive Samuel Dravis was actually testing and modifying the virus and deliberately tried to kill him by overloading <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> drive on his ship. After some persuasion and offers from the director, including a new ship and an AI assistant known as the Guide-Bot, the Material Defender accepts to help the Red Acropolis stop the virus.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{returns to}} Enterprise, {{which has been}} taken over by the Gorn. Kirk and Spock space dive to {{engineering}} and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board. They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate <b>the</b> <b>warp</b> core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance, and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar. Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes; in their closing logs, Kirk and Spock state T'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan, and that they have been ordered to Nibiru.|$|E
