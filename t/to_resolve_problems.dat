5|$|Penfold {{returned}} to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to {{a position in the}} West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The department was divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was responsible) and independent nations. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the winding-up of the Colonial Service—which had historically provided most governors and many civil servants—in the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a policy paper that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also identified several posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> of entrenched localism.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Phil was calmer than Grant {{but both}} {{brothers}} {{had a sense}} of physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be very violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do his dirty work, amongst other things.|$|E
25|$|Production Phantoms {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} design improvements. These included provisions for a flush-fitting centerline drop tank, an improved gunsight, {{and the addition of}} speed brakes. Production models used Westinghouse J30-WE-20 engines with 1,600lbf (7.1kN) of thrust per engine. The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller rudder was used <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> with control surface clearance discovered during test flights. The horizontal tail surfaces were shortened slightly, while the fuselage was stretched by 19in (48cm). The amount of framing in the windshield was reduced to enhance pilot visibility.|$|E

25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both {{had a sense of}} physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him. Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|Ferrying Mosquitos {{and many}} other types of WWII {{aircraft}} from Canada to Europe was dangerous, resulting in losses of lives and machines, but in the exigencies of war it was regarded as the best option for twin-engine and multi-engine aircraft..

25|$|Christopher Morris (Chris Morris) – the newsreader. Morris {{has several}} {{computers}} {{giving him the}} news instantly from around the world, and often interrupts segments in order to break in with more important stories. He is always confrontational and aggressive, frequently picking fights with his staff and guests while on-air, and his efforts <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> (such as airing the BBC's emergency all-purpose propaganda film) frequently make bad situations even worse. Morris' unnecessarily aggressive personality often causes tensions {{between him and his}} staff, and is even responsible for triggering a war between Australia and Hong Kong. His mannerisms – and, particularly, his physical appearance in the pilot episode – suggests that his character is at least loosely based on that of Jeremy Paxman, and there are echoes of Michael Buerk's style of delivery (most notable in the 'Genutainment' section of episode 1). In The Day Today, Morris essentially reprises his overzealous newsreader role from On the Hour, although his bullying streak is far more pronounced in the character's TV incarnation.|$|E

25|$|Czechoslovakia had an {{interest}} in stabilizing the situation, because the foreign ministry had <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>problems</b> with Poland and Germany {{and did not want to}} start negotiations before October 15. The Czechoslovak minister of foreign affairs was focused on building new relationships with Germany and Italy to negotiate guarantees for new borders. After the Munich Agreement all political subjects in Slovakia concluded that it is necessary to change the position of Slovakia within the state and declared autonomy (October 6, 1938). The new, autonomous government understood the definition of borders as a priority and the Slovak People's Party requested participation in the negotiations. The central government in Prague was aware that the delegation should be led by a Slovak and considered Milan Hodža or Imrich Karvaš. However, after the creation of an autonomous government, foreign minister František Chvalkovský proposed its representatives – Jozef Tiso or Ferdinand Ďurčanský. Both politicians refused with the justification that the role was in competition with the central government. When it was emphasized that it is mainly the interest of Slovakia, they accepted. Moreover, Jozef Tiso hoped that Hungarian partners would accept concessions easier if they did not negotiate with representatives of the central government. Under the pressure of the threat of internal destabilization of Czechoslovakia because of diverting actions and further radicalization of the situation in Hungary, Czechoslovakia agreed to begin negotiations on October 9.|$|E
