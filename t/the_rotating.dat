5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E

For <b>the</b> <b>rotated</b> sine circle map, we demonstrate an analytical relationship between the geometric phase and the rotation number of the system. For the discrete version of <b>the</b> <b>rotated</b> rotator considered by Berry, <b>the</b> <b>rotated</b> standard map, we further explore this connection {{as well as the}} role of the geometric phase at the onset of chaos.

Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure.|$|E

40|$|Former works {{show that}} the {{accuracy}} of the second-kind integral equations can be improved dramatically by using <b>the</b> <b>rotated</b> Buffa-Christiansen (BC) functions as the testing functions, and sometimes their accuracy can be even better than the first-kind integral equations. When <b>the</b> <b>rotated</b> BC functions are used as the testing functions, the discretization error of the identity operators involved in the second-kind integral equations can be suppressed significantly.
