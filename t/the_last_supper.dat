5|$|In 1977, another {{investigation}} was {{undertaken by the}} States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be genuine Vermeers, including the Emmaus and <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system.|$|E
5|$|John lacks {{scenes from}} the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> Conversely, it {{includes}} scenes {{not found in the}} synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b>|$|E

5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long shots to show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel {{closed in}} 1988 and, in 1991, Hardee opened the Up The Creek comedy club in Creek Road, Greenwich. In an upstairs {{bar at the}} club was a mural {{commissioned}} by Hardee as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci's <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> It showed Hardee as Christ with Jo Brand, Julian Clary and other famous British comedians as the Disciples including Ben Elton as Judas Iscariot.|$|E

5|$|Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty and Evans {{passed over}} the Simplon Pass and on to Milan, where they viewed Leonardo's <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> and visited the Brera Gallery. After a sixteen-day {{cabriolet}} ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached Florence, where they stayed for two days visiting the city's galleries. On 10August, the two men finally reached Rome.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper,</b> and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{worked in}} Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was {{commissioned}} {{to paint the}} Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Ludovico to meet Matthias Corvinus, for whom he {{is believed to have}} painted a Holy Family. Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents. When she died in 1495, the list of funeral expenditures suggests that she was his mother.|$|E

50|$|Leonardo da Vinci's <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> fresco was a {{significant}} influence on Rubens who created an etching after <b>the</b> Davinci <b>Last</b> <b>Supper,</b> {{which was one of}} Rubens first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.|$|R
50|$|Cabatuan is {{also known}} {{to have the most}} wooden and {{porcelain}} statues being showcased on Lenten processions (a religious parade evident in almost all parishes in the Philippines during Holy Week).

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> Around the edge at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
50|$|The Upper Room is a {{reference}} to <b>the</b> Biblical <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> of Jesus and his disciples, hence the thirteen paintings. Ofili states the work {{is not intended to}} be offensive, but rather to contrast the harmonious life of the monkeys with the travails of the human race.|$|R
50|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a pious Havana {{plantation}} owner in the 1790s, during Cuba's Spanish colonial period. The plantation owner decides to recreate <b>the</b> Biblical <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> using twelve of the slaves working in his sugarcane fields, hoping to thus teach the slaves about Christianity.|$|R

5|$|The Platonic solids {{and other}} polyhedra are a {{recurring}} theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the small stellated dodecahedron, attributed to Paolo Uccello, in {{the floor of the}} San Marco Basilica in Venice; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book The Divine Proportion; as a glass rhombicuboctahedron in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in Albrecht Dürer's engraving Melencolia I; and in Salvador Dalí's painting <b>The</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.|$|E
5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} {{sources for the}} life and message of Jesus. However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E
5|$|A Ricci {{painting}} of <b>the</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> {{was above the}} main altar, which was dedicated to Jesus the Redeemer; in 1662, a fresco of the Madonna was moved there. The Ardicini cardinals had the image painted on the facade of their palace in Borgo Sant'Angelo, and it was venerated by the local people because {{of a number of}} miracles attributed to her intercession. On the altar was an African-marble tabernacle by Giovanni Battista Ciolli, and {{to the right of the}} entrance was a holy water font presented to the church in 1589 by Francesco Del Sodo (a member of the archconfraternity). The church was the burial place of several people, whose tombstones adorned the floor; among them were the son and mother-in-law of Pirro Ligorio and Battista Gerosa, son of the Oratory of San Sebastiano architect Antonio Gerosa.|$|E
