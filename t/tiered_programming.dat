40|$|As the {{commoditization}} of sensing, actuation {{and communication}} hardware increases, {{so does the}} potential for dynamically tasked sense and respond networked systems (i. e., Sensor Networks or SNs) to replace existing disjoint and inflexible special-purpose deployments (closed-circuit security video, anti-theft sensors, etc.). While various solutions have emerged to many individual SN-centric challenges (e. g., power management, communication protocols, role assignment), perhaps the largest remaining obstacle to widespread SN deployment is that {{those who wish to}} deploy, utilize, and maintain a programmable Sensor Network lack the programming and systems expertise to do so. The contributions of this thesis centers on the design, development and deployment of the SN Workbench (snBench). snBench embodies an accessible, modular programming platform coupled with a flexible and extensible run-time system that, together, support the entire life-cycle of distributed sensory services. As it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all programming interface, this work advocates the use of tiered layers of abstraction that enable a variety of high-level, domain specific languages to be compiled to a common (thin-waist) tasking language; this common tasking language is statically verified and can be subsequently re-translated, if needed, for execution {{on a wide variety of}} hardware platforms. snBench provides: (1) a common sensory tasking language (Instruction Set Architecture) powerful enough to express complex SN services, yet simple enough to be executed by highly constrained resources with soft, real-time constraints, (2) a prototype high-level language (and corresponding compiler) to illustrate the utility of the common tasking language and the <b>tiered</b> <b>programming</b> approach in this domain, (3) an execution environment and a run-time support infrastructure that abstract a collection of heterogeneous resources into a single virtual Sensor Network, tasked via this common tasking language, and (4) novel formal methods (i. e., static analysis techniques) that verify safety properties and infer implicit resource constraints to facilitate resource allocation for new services. This thesis presents these components in detail, as well as two specific case-studies: the use of snBench to integrate physical and wireless network security, and the use of snBench as the foundation for semester-long student projects in a graduate-level Software Engineering course...|$|E

40|$|Frequent Flier Programs (FFPs) {{are said}} to impact airline {{consumer}} behaviour such that revenue of sponsoring airlines increases. Prior research relies on aggregate industry data to study FFPs. We {{examine the impact of}} FFPs on individual consumer behaviour in a quasi-natural experimental set-up using a combined discrete choice and count data model. We exploit an unanticipated change in the FFP to avoid self-selection bias. We derive the causal effect of redesigning a frequency reward program into a customer <b>tier</b> <b>program</b> on average transaction size, purchase frequency, revenues of the sponsoring airline, and compensating variation. We find that, on average, revenues increased by 8 $ per member over a 16 month period. The welfare impact is small but positive. We find that, on average, consumer surplus increased by 5 $ per member over a 16 month period. The results vary su bstantially across individuals. In line with previous studies, our results suggest that moderate buyers increase their average transaction size and purchase frequency most due to the introduction of the customer <b>tier</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of guaranteed end-to-end {{quality of service}} (QoS) increases as business-to-business (B 2 B) interactions become increasingly sophisticated, lengthy, and involve more sites. In particular, support for transparent failovers is often required, even if failures occur {{in more than one}} tier at the same time. One of the obstacles in achieving a transparent failover is determining the status of outstanding operations, some of which span several tiers. Aid from neighboring tiers is often needed. In this paper we present ITRA (inter-tier relationship architecture). ITRA describes mechanisms, the role of each tier with respect to its predecessor and successor <b>tiers,</b> <b>programming</b> model and inter-tier relationship protocol. Web Services following the ITRA architecture can collaborate to transparently recover from failures in multiple tiers, as well as better exploit mutual resources to provide the required availability and failover transparency.

40|$|AbstractA {{computer-based}} dynamic assessment (DA) system {{developed for}} use in an undergraduate fluid mechanics course is presented. Data collected before and after implementation of this DA indicate significant improvement in student performance after implementation. Student performance is quantified by the % of questions correctly answered in the nationally normed Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Exam relative to the National average. Since implementation of the DA system, this measure for our students has increased from below National level (mean = 0. 942; standard deviation, sd = 0. 068) to above National level (mean = 1. 04; sd = 0. 06). For the same population, performance in fluid mechanics has been higher than that in the other subjects where DA was not used (mean = 1. 068; sd = 0. 028 vs. mean = 0. 837; sd = 0. 04).

40|$|Objectives – This study {{examines}} {{the connection between}} student academic success and information literacy instruction. Locally, it allowed librarians to ascertain the institution’s saturation rate for information literacy instruction and identify academic programs not utilizing library instruction services. In a broader application, it provides an argument for a <b>tiered</b> <b>program</b> of information literacy instruction and offers student perspectives on improving a library instruction program. Methods – Focus groups with 15 graduating seniors, {{all of whom had}} attended at least one library instruction session, discussed student experiences and preferences regarding library instruction. An analysis of 4, 489 academic transcripts of graduating seniors identified differences in grade point average (GPA) between students with different levels of library instruction. Results – Students value library instruction for orientation purposes as beginning students, and specialized, discipline-specific library instruction in upper-level courses. There is a statistically significant difference in GPA between graduating seniors who had library instruction in upper-level courses (defined in this study as post-freshman-level) and those who did not. Conclusions – Library instruction seems to make the most difference to student success when it is repeated at different levels in the university curriculum, especially when it is offered in upper-level courses. Instruction librarians should differentiate between lower-division and upper-division learning objectives for students {{in order to create a}} more cohesive and non-repetitive information literacy curriculum...|$|R
