5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> periods and the rotation rates.|$|E

5|$|A third {{possibility}} {{is where the}} primary and moon are tidally locked to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> period will not change.

50|$|It {{is assumed}} that the overlap matrix S is the {{identity}} matrix. This means that overlap between <b>the</b> <b>orbitals</b> is neglected and <b>the</b> <b>orbitals</b> are considered orthogonal. Then the generalised eigenvalue problem of the Ritz method turns into an eigenvalue problem.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{separation}} between <b>the</b> <b>orbitals</b> is large, then <b>the</b> lower energy <b>orbitals</b> are completely filled before population of <b>the</b> higher <b>orbitals</b> according to <b>the</b> Aufbau principle. Complexes such as this are called [...] "low-spin" [...] since filling an orbital matches electrons and reduces the total electron spin. If {{the separation}} between <b>the</b> <b>orbitals</b> is small enough then {{it is easier to}} put electrons into <b>the</b> higher energy <b>orbitals</b> than it is to put two into <b>the</b> same low-energy <b>orbital,</b> because of <b>the</b> repulsion resulting from matching two electrons in <b>the</b> same <b>orbital.</b> So, one electron is put into each of <b>the</b> five d <b>orbitals</b> before any pairing occurs in accord with Hund's rule resulting in what is known as a [...] "high-spin" [...] complex. Complexes such as this are called [...] "high-spin" [...] since populating <b>the</b> upper <b>orbital</b> avoids matches between electrons with opposite spin.|$|R

This is significantly larger than <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> radius1070000kmof the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede.

5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the model}} present by ligand field theory, <b>the</b> ns <b>orbital</b> is {{involved}} in bonding to the ligands and forms a strongly bonding orbital which has predominantly ligand character and the correspondingly strong anti-bonding orbital which is unfilled and usually well above the lowest unoccupied molecular <b>orbital</b> (LUMO). Since <b>the</b> <b>orbitals</b> resulting from <b>the</b> ns <b>orbital</b> are either buried in bonding or elevated well above the valence, <b>the</b> ns <b>orbitals</b> are not relevant to describing the valence. Depending on the geometry of the final complex, either all three of <b>the</b> np <b>orbitals</b> or portions of them are involved in bonding, similar to <b>the</b> ns <b>orbitals.</b> <b>The</b> np <b>orbitals</b> if any that remain non-bonding still exceed the valence of the complex. That leaves the (n − 1)d orbitals {{to be involved in}} some portion of the bonding and in the process also describes the metal complex's valence electrons. The final description of the valence is highly dependent on the complex's geometry, in turn highly dependent on the d electron count and character of the associated ligands.|$|R

Measuring 4ft x 10ft x 6ft (1.22m x 3.05m x 1.83m), its 56 neon panels required 168,000 volts of electricity to operate, with a separate table to support the transformers; the final price for the dock setup was $200,000.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E

5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations {{means that the}} planet has a mass at least 5.7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System. However, the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet's mass, depending on <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> inclination to our line-of-sight. Therefore, the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit.|$|E
5|$|The current Laplace {{resonance}} {{is unable}} to pump <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible. The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; {{if it is not}} pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago. Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015—tidal heating is negligible now. However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to pump <b>the</b> <b>orbital</b> eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.|$|E
