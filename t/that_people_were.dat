I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine. Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on cocaine.

5|$|In 2004, the {{possibility}} arose of his father's record of 257hits {{in a season}} being surpassed by Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. Living in Dallas, Texas at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was being talked about and <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154games, {{there would be an}} asterisk noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it. Ichiro finished the season with 262hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at Safeco Field. The younger Sisler was prevented by an emergency heart procedure from travelling to Seattle. Both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E

50|$|Self-enhancement biases {{may play}} a role, in <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> {{motivated}} to view themselves in a positive light.

5|$|In {{controlled}} {{studies in}} the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that brand names {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaser trailer}} was {{released}} on selected screens accompanying Meet Joe Black on November 13, 1998, and media reported <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> paying full admission at theaters to see the trailer. To keep fans from leaving before the movie was over, some theaters played the teaser an additional time after the film finished. A second trailer {{was released on}} March 12, 1999, with the film Wing Commander. Again, many fans paid full theater admission to watch the new trailer. A bootlegged version of the preview was leaked to the Internet the same day. The next morning, the trailer was released on the film's official website and shortly afterwards the servers became overloaded. The theatrical trailer caused even more media attention because it was premiered in theaters and screened at the |ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas, and was aired on Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.|$|E

Veronica shows some information about Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan stole a boat. However, when the boat is searched they do not find anyone—just evidence <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away {{while he was in}} it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back.|$|E

5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 once all the signs were removed. The justification for the removal was <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E
5|$|Docherty {{found work}} as a {{domestic}} servant {{at the age of}} 14, before moving on to working in a factory. She tried to find a job after returning from Russia, but her travel there meant <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> unwilling to employ her. Thus she sold firewood along with her father for a while. She eventually found work at the Leith Hospital as a cleaner, because that job did not require references. She then worked as a servant for five years, before leaving to attend to her mother, who was ill. Back in Fife, she worked as an assistant to a dentist. She stated later in life that when she attended rallies with the communist party, she had to lie to her employers about where she went. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she began working in the Crombie munitions factory, before shifting to looking after children in Rosyth. The final job she held was at a cooperative bakery. She continued her work for the Communist Party while holding all of these positions.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

Here we examined whether blind and sighted individuals {{vary in their}} level of social trust in others. One hundred and twenty-four healthy men and women participated in the study, including 32 congenitally blind, 27 late blind, and 65 sighted adult controls. We measured levels of social trust represented by two independent convictions, <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> exploitative, or dishonest. Linear mixed models showed {{no significant differences between}} sighted, late blind and congenitally blind individuals, indicating that visual deprivation does not predict level of trust in others. For both blind and sighted participants, the belief <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> exploitative was stronger than the belief <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> dishonest...|$|R
