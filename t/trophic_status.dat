The exact <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is {{suspected}} to be fucaltitive mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. frustrata from Turkey might have been recently introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe.

500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (black darter) and Libellula quadrimaculata (four-spotted chaser) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E

A lignocellulosic matrix was obtained using aqueous extraction of dried plant material (&# 8776; 40 °C). Incubations for decomposition of the lignocellulosic matrix were prepared using lignocelluloses, inoculums and filtered water simulating different <b>trophic</b> <b>statuses</b> with the same N:P ratio. The particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC, respectively) were quantified, the cellulase enzymatic activity was measured by releasing reducing sugars and immobilized carbon was analyzed by filtration. During the cellulose degradation indicated by the cellulase activity, the dissolved organic carbon daily rate and enzyme activity increased. It was related to a fast hydrolysable fraction of cellulose that contributed to short-term carbon immobilization (ca. 10 days). After approximately 20 days, the dissolved organic carbon and enzyme activity were inversely correlated suggesting that the respiration of microorganisms was responsible for carbon mineralization. Cellulose was an important resource in low nutrient conditions (oligotrophic). However, the detritus quality {{played a major role in}} the lignocelluloses degradation (i. e., enzyme activity) and carbon release...|$|R

Interannual variation was greatest in the green turtle. When comparing green and loggerhead turtles nesting in Cyprus we found that green turtles {{were more likely to}} change the interval between laying seasons and showed greater variation in the number of clutches laid in a season. We suggest that these di¡erences are driven by the varying <b>trophic</b> <b>statuses</b> of the di¡erent species.

The protocol was applied to freshwater samples collected during different seasons (spring and summer/autumn) in two lakes whose <b>trophic</b> <b>statuses</b> varied. Because few samples were collected (i. e., two dates per site), the findings are considered preliminary and mainly a “proof of concept” rather than a valid comparison of sites versus seasons. The results from the proposed protocol indicate higher diversity of infected host and parasite communities than in previous studies. Chytrid epidemics were omnipresent, infecting diverse phytoplankton host communities, primarily diatoms, chlorophytes, and colonial and filamentous cyanobacteria. The diversity and numerical abundance of sporangia and of hosts, and the prevalence of infection (range, < 1 to 24 % of total host cells) as well, increased from the oligotrophic Lake Pavin to the eutrophic Lake Aydat, while the temporal changes in parasites were apparently more influenced by the host community composition.

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{products}} are released at low concentrations into aquatic environments following domestic wastewater treatment. Such low concentrations {{have been shown}} to induce transcriptional responses in microorganisms, which could have consequences on aquatic ecosystem dynamics. In order to test if these transcriptional responses could also be observed in complex river microbial communities, biofilm reactors were inoculated with water from two rivers of differing <b>trophic</b> <b>statuses</b> and subsequently treated with environmentally relevant doses (ng/liter to ?g/liter range) of four pharmaceuticals (erythromycin [ER], gemfibrozil [GM], sulfamethazine [SN], and sulfamethoxazole [SL]). To monitor functional gene expression, we constructed a 9, 600 -feature anonymous DNA microarray platform onto which cDNA from the biofilms was hybridized. Pharmaceutical treatments induced both positive and negative transcriptional responses from biofilm microorganisms. For instance, ER induced the transcription of several stress, transcription, and replication genes, while GM, a lipid regulator, induced transcriptional responses from several genes involved in lipid metabolism. SN caused shifts in genes involved in energy production and conversion, and SL induced responses from a range of cell membrane and outer envelope genes, which in turn could affect biofilm formation. The results presented here demonstrate {{for the first time that}} low concentrations of small molecules can induce transcriptional changes in a complex microbial community.

Data were collected on board the R/V Hannibal during July 2005. Distinct water masses were identified using cluster analysis of temperatureesalinity (TeS) characteristics. Three major clusters appeared based on the combined effects of temperature and salinity. The first cluster was identified as the cool and less salty bottom Modified Atlantic Water (MAW). The warmer and saltier Mediterranean Mixed Water (MMW) represented the second cluster. The third cluster was the Transition Water (TW) separating the two previous clusters. The pigment and taxonomic composition of these water masses were examined. Chlorophyll a was rather low (< 200 ng l 1). Chlorophyll b was generally the most abundant accessory pigment and fucoxanthin dominated the accessory pigments in the MAW. Proportions of chlorophyll a associated with different phytoplankton classes were estimated using CHEMTAX software, and did not present significant variations among water groups. The results pointed out variations in the relative contribution of each phytoplankton taxa in each station group. Chlorophytes and prasinophytes accounted for 65 % of chlorophyll a in the MMW. Diatoms and chlorophytes were relatively abundant in the MAW contributing to almost 63 % of chlorophyll a. An unstructured community, slightly dominated by prasinophytes, chlorophytes and cryptophytes, characterised the TW. Different <b>trophic</b> <b>statuses</b> were observed in these water masses, the MMWand the MAWbeing characterised by mesotrophy, while an oligotrophy was observed in the TW.

By translating the Secchi transparency values to a log base 2 scale, each successive doubling of biomass is represented as a whole integer index number.

Our results suggested a food web characterized by main flows at the basis of the food web and a high contribution of primary producers and detritus to the entire system input flows. The developmental stage of the ecosystem was characterized using estimated Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices; the LIM-MCMC produced a higher estimate of flow specialization (than the estimate from Ecopath) owing to better consideration of bacterial processes.

In this study, the assess-ment of the <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> of lakes included water qual-ity; abundance and biomass of bacterioplankton, phyto-plankton, and zooplankton; and primary production of phytoplankton. The Carlson trophic state index (TSI) describes the level of water fertility and indicated the dominance of moderately eutrophic waters. Lakes Perty, Jeglówek, and Hańcza have a <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> that indi-cates mesotrophy (TSI < 50). The <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> of the studied lakes was determined based on the bacterial abundance and clearly showed a lack of oligotrophic lakes in SLP. Based on the number of bacteria, only Lake Szurpiły can be classified as β-mesotrophic, whereas Lake Linówek can be characterized as hyper-trophic with some features typical for humic waters. The greatest value of gross primary production was observed in Lake Linówek (126. 4 mg C/m 3 /h).

In this framework, the socio-economic value of transitional waters and their role as natural heritage are particularly important. To improve our knowledge of the ecological status and ecosystem functioning of transitional waters, investigations were carried out in Italian lagoons in the Po Delta and elsewhere (Marano-Grado, Goro, Comacchio, Pialassa Baiona, Lesina and Orbertello), applying the same procedures in accordance with National and International protocols.

The trophic index of Benya, Nakwa, Amisa and Nyanya ranges between 35. 0 – 39. 0 and falls within Carlson’s TSI range scale of 30 – 40, which implies that their waters are oligotrophic. The Oyibi lagoon is mildly eutrophic (Carlson’s TSI scale of 56) in the riverine portion. However, at the seaward end it has TSI of 42, which is moderately clear. Similarly, Muni lagoon is moderately clear with TSI range of 35. 8 – 43. 1. The Sakumo II lagoon is hypereutrophic at the riverine end (Carlson’s TSI of 87. 8). The seaward end is oligotrophic. The high phosphorus (231. 9 kg/day) and nitrogen (927. 9 kg/day) recorded at Nyanya lagoon are as a result of domestic activities mainly from the wastes generated from humans at the lagoon and its surroundings. The use of nutrients and transparency, in predicting the <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> of lagoons and coastal waters is a new and emerging scientific way of looking at lagoon <b>trophic</b> <b>status.</b> The nutrient inputs into lagoons, as well as transparency, are direct impacts of human activities.

To achieve this goal, however, additional investigations dealing with the evaluation of lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> and the autecological features of key diatom species were carried out. Because a unifying index and classification for lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> was not available, a new multiple index was developed in this study, by the computation of the physical, chemical and biological data from 85 south Ontario lakes. By using the new trophic parameter, the lake trophic level (TL) was determined: TL = 1. 37 In[1 +(TP x Chl-a / SD) ], where, TP=total phosphorus, Chl-a=chlorophyll-a and SD=Secchi depth. The boundaries between 7 lake trophic categories (Ultra-oligotrophic lakes: 0 - 0. 24; Oligotrophic lakes: 0. 241 - 1. 8; Oligomesotrophic lakes: 1. 813. 0; Mesotrophic lakes: 3. 01 - 4. 20; Mesoeutrophic lakes: 4. 21 - 5. 4; Eutrophic lakes: 5. 41 - 10 and Hyper-eutrophic lakes: above 10) were established. The new trophic parameter was more convenient for management of water quality, communication to the public and comparison with other lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> indices than many of the previously published indices because the TL index attempts to Increase understanding of the characteristics of lakes and their comprehensive trophic states. It is more reasonable and clear for a unifying determination of true trophic states of lakes. Diatom specIes autecology analysis was central to this thesis. However, the autecological relationship of diatom species and lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> had not previously been well documented. Based on the investigation of the diatom composition and variety of species abundance in 30 study lakes, the distribution optima of diatom species were determined. These determinations were based on a quantitative method called "weighted average" (Charles 1985). On this basis, the diatom species were classified into five trophic categories (oligotrophic, oligomesotrophic, mesotrophic, mesoeutrophic and eutrophic species groups). The resulting diatom <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> autecological features were used in the regressIon analysis between diatom assemblages and lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status.</b> When the TL trophic level values of the 30 lakes were regressed against their fi ve corresponding diatom trophic groups, the two mathematical equations for expressing the assumed linear relationship between the diatom assemblages composition were determined by (1) uSIng a single regression technique: Trophic level of lake (TL) = 2. 643 - 7. 575 log (Index D) (r = 0. 88 r 2 = 0. 77 P = 0. 0001; n = 30) Where, Index D = (0 % + OM% + M%) /(E% + ME% + M%); 4 (2) uSIng a' multiple regressIon technique: TL= 4. 285 - 0. 076 0 %- 0. 055 OM% - 0. 026 M% + 0. 033 ME% + 0. 065 E% (r= 0. 89, r 2 = 0. 792, P=O. OOOl, n= 30) There was a significant correlation between measured and diatom inferred trophic levels both by single and multiple regressIon methods (P 0. 68, n= 20). As such, the two transfer function models between diatoms and lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> were validated. The two models obtained as noted above were developed using one group of lakes and then tested using an entirely different group of lakes. This study indicated that diatom assemblages are sensitive to lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status.</b> As indicators of lake <b>trophic</b> <b>status,</b> diatoms are especially useful in situations where no local trophic information is available and in studies of the paleotrophic history of lakes.

The study follows amulti-proxy approach, using fossil bioindicators, such as diatoms (see Hoff et al.), pollen (see Dirksen, V. etal.) and chironomids, as well as geochemistry, radiocarbon dating, and tephra stratigraphy (see Dirksen, O. etal.). In addition to available peat samples from former field work, lacustrine sediment cores were taken during alimnogeological expedition to Kamchatka in September 2007. Promising mid- to late Holocene sediment recordswere obtained from Two-Yurts Lake, situated in a former proglacial basin of the central Kamchatka mountainchain. The hydrology of Two-Yurts Lake is characterized by an open system with three major riverine inflows andone outflow. Lake waters reveal neutral pH values, fresh-water conditions, and slight oxygen undersaturation insummer. The lake basin morphology is characterized by a flat profundal plain at 21 - 27 m water depth. A terraceat 2 m above present level and another subaquatic terrace at 16 m water depth give evidence of former lake-levelfluctuations. Sediment core PG 1857 was taken from {{the central part of the}} lake basin. Radiocarbon dating andtephra stratigraphy suggest a basal age of 7. 5 ka BP, consistent with dating results from an offshore peat sectionthat covers a glacial moraine to the east of the lake (see Dirksen, O. et al.). Above a basal clay, the lake sediments consist of diatomaceous oozes with interspersed ash layers. Fossil diatomassemblages are dominated by planktonic cold-water forms indicating low to intermediate <b>trophic</b> lake <b>status</b> (seeHoff et al.), as also indicated by low concentrations of total organic matter (TOC) and low TOC/TN ratios. Inaddition to diatoms, the lake sediments include abundant fossil chironomid head capsules, exhibiting a higherbiodiversity than in temperate climate zones. Changes in chironomid assemblages give insight into changesin lake ecology, water depth and temperature. The lacustrine pollen records point to vegetation changes in thecatchment. On the basis of preliminary data, the variability of proxy data in sediment core PG 1857 suggest ahigher than present biological productivity, lower lake level and higher temperature before 3. 7 ka BP. Subsequentlake-deepening and cooling appeared in conjunction with increased detrital sediment supply, possibly pointing toenhanced fluvial run-off. The observed environmental changes towards the late Holocene are consistent with theonset of neoglacial climate deterioration on Kamchatka...|$|R

40|$|Fish larvae in Australian waters {{have been}} studied {{progressively}} in the last 2 - 3 decades including the distribution and abundance of taxa, growth and age, their prey and predators. However, the effect of nutrient limitation on ichthyoplankton is unstudied, particularly in the oligotrophic Australian waters. My study was aimed to {{examine the effect of}} natural or anthropogenic nutrients on the abundance, distribution, growth and condition of fish larvae along-shore of the NSW coast (latitude 30 - 34 S), where the East Australian Current departs the NSW coast and generates local upwelling of cool nutrient-rich water. This study shows {{no significant difference in the}} total abundance or diversity of either larval fishes amongst the 112 taxa (111 families and 1 order), among regions within or upstream of the upwelling. However in both months, there were distinctive ichthyoplankton assemblages at the family level. The Carangidae, Labridae, Lutjanidae, Microcanthidae, Myctophidae and Scombridae were more abundant in the EAC or oceanic water masses, while the Callionymidae, Clupeidae, Platycephalidae, Sillaginidae and Terapontidae were mostly found in the surface or deep upwelled/uplifted water masses. This pattern is observed in other ichthyoplankton studies and may be a general and useful method to determine mixing of water masses. Larvae of silver trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) and yellowtail scad (Trachurus novaezelandiae) were generally larger and less abundant in the topographically induced upwelling region, than north of the region in pre-upwelled conditions of the East Australian Current. Both species were mostly at the preflexion stage (less than 4. 3 mm in body length and less than 10 days old) in the pre-upwelled conditions, particularly during November, and proportionally more larger and older larvae in the upwelled waters (mostly post-flexion, greater than 4. 3 mm in body length and greater than 10 days old). Ages from sagittal otoliths ranged from 2 - 25 increments (~days) and exhibited linear growth for both species and months over the size range (3 - 15 mm standard length). The otolith radius-length relationship and the growth rates were similar between species and months, despite the 3 - 4 C difference between months. Overall growth rates of the younger larvae were uniform throughout the entire sampling area (0. 5 - 0. 6 mm. d- 1), while older larvae grew significantly faster in the upwelled water (0. 41 mm. d- 1) compared to the non-upwelled conditions (0. 34 mm. d- 1). Both species tended to be depleted in 13 C in the upwelling region (from &# 150; 18. 5 to &# 150; 19. 0), consistent with expected ratios from deeper water, whereas the 15 N composition tended to increase in Pseudocaranx, but decrease in Trachurus indicating different diets and possibly trophic level. The early life history of both species indicates spawning in pre-upwelled waters, but larval transport into upwelled waters is necessary for faster growth in the post-flexion stage. The assemblage of larval fishes did differ between the upwelled region and a region south of Sydney&# 146;s deepwater outfalls, but the difference was ascribed to a latitudinal effect and the EAC. Both larval carangids were enriched in 15 N, possibly due to the enriched dissolved organic matter of primary treated sewage. In summary, this study found that the larval fish community can provide a biological means to trace water masses, and estimate their degree of mixing. Remarkably there was no significant effect of upwelling or sewage addition to the abundance or diversity of larval fish, in the nutrient poor waters of the East Australian Current. Larval carangids and pilchards were abundant in late spring off northern NSW, and their early life histories were inferred. Both larval carangid species seem to be spawned in the EAC waters, but as post-flexion larvae grew faster in the upwelled zone. Pre-flexion (less than 10 day old) larval carangids of both genera indicated spawning in the EAC, and the rarer post-flexion (greater than 10 days old) carangids grew faster in the upwelled waters. Here, both genera had stable isotope signatures characteristic of upwelled waters for carbon, but had different nitrogen signatures, indicative of different diets and <b>trophic</b> level <b>status.</b> Larval pilchards actually grew more slowly in the upwelling region, as observed in coastal waters off Japan, and their nursery grounds may be further offshore in the Tasman Front, analogous to their early life history in the Kuroshio Extension...|$|R

40|$|The Zambian Macrophyte Trophic Ranking system (ZMTR) {{is a new}} bioassessment {{scheme to}} {{indicate}} the <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> of tropical southern African river systems. It was developed using a dataset of 218 samples of macrophytes and water chemistry, collected during 2009 – 2012, from river sites located in five world freshwater ecoregions primarily represented in Zambia. A typology based on these ecoregions, and three stream order categories, {{was used to determine}} soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) reference conditions. Zambian Trophic Ranking Scores (ZTRSsp) were calculated for 156 species, using direct allocation from SRP data for 80 species, in samples for which sufficient available SRP data existed. An indirect quantitative procedure, based upon occurrence of species in six sample-groups, of differing mean SRP status, produced by TWINSPAN classification, allocated provisional ZTRSsp values for the remaining 76 species. Additional data for nitrate, pH, alkalinity and conductivity were used to help assess the trophic preferences of macrophyte species showing differing ZTRSsp values. ZMTRsample values were calculated as the mean ZTRSsp score of species present per sample. ZMTR indicated <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> reasonably accurately for 83. 1 % of Zambian samples, and for all samples within a test dataset from Botswanan rivers.

This is the first lake in the Samica Stęszewska river, flowing distally through the lakes of the Wielkopolski National Park. Source part of the Samica Stęszewska river basin was, in the years 2004 – 2012, included to the nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ), and Niepruszewskie Lake {{was considered to be}} threatened by eutrophication. The evaluation of <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> of the lake was made based on the concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and indicators of eutrophication (chlorophyll a, water transparency Secchi disk marked) by referring them to the limit values for the eutrophication of surface waters as defined in the Regulation of the Minister of Environment of 23 December 2002 and other criteria used for the classification of the eutrophication of surface waters. Detailed and synthetic indexes of the <b>trophic</b> <b>status</b> (TSI) using the formula Carlson and the ratio of N:P were also made. Concentrations of the nutrients in Lake Niepruszewskie and eutrophication indexes reached high values, indicating a eutrophic or hypertrophic state of the lake.

40|$|Apex predators such as lions, {{wolves and}} orcas occupy {{the top of}} food chains and are known to exert strong {{top-down}} control of prey abundance, community structure and ecosystem productivity. Despite the importance of apex predators in both terrestrial and oceanic habitats, there is a paucity of information on this guild for coral reef ecosystems. Sharks are among the largest predators on coral reefs and may function as apex predators, but {{our understanding of the}} ecological role and importance of these organisms is poor. Recent declines in shark populations are also leading to concerns that these potentially important species may be effectively lost from reef systems before we realise their role in ecosystem dynamics. Thus, the overall focus of this thesis was to examine the <b>status,</b> <b>trophic</b> role and importance of large predators, namely reef sharks, on coral reefs, thereby providing management with improved tools for understanding how the removal of predators via fishing influences ecosystem properties. The high mobility and generally low abundances of reef sharks has led to considerable debate regarding the optimal method/s for assessing their population status. Due to controversy surrounding previous stock assessments, the focus of Chapter 2 was to evaluate potential biases in five survey methods (timed-swim, towed-diver, baited-remote-underwater- video, stationary-point-count, and audible-stationary-count) for assessing reef shark populations, and whether these biases (if any) vary among reefs that are subject to different levels of human interaction due to conservation zoning. For timed-swim, towed-diver, and baited-remote-underwater-video (BRUV) surveys, shark encounter rates were constant over time, suggesting minimal bias caused by, for example, shark attraction to divers. For audible-stationary-count (ASC) surveys, encounter rates were elevated initially, then decreased rapidly, but the extent of upward bias did not differ between management zones. Timed-swim, BRUV, and ASC surveys produced comparable estimates of shark density, however, towed-diver-surveys produced significantly lower estimates of shark density. These findings provide no evidence for biases in diver-surveys: encounter rates with sharks were not elevated when divers first entered the water; behavioural responses of sharks were consistent across management zones; and diver-surveys yielded abundance estimates comparable to stationary non-diver surveys. These results indicate that estimates of abundance generated by diver-surveys such as underwater visual transects are reliable, minimally biased, and suitable for assessing shark populations in the field. Quantifying the distribution and habitat use of sharks is critical for estimating their population sizes, understanding their ecological role, and for establishing appropriate conservation and management regimes. The goal of Chapter 3 was to survey shark populations across outer-shelf reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) {{in order to determine the}} diversity, abundance, and distribution of reef sharks across three major coral reef habitats: (1) the reef slope, (2) the back reef and (3) the reef flat. Results revealed that, of the variables that were examined, habitat was the best predictor of shark distribution and abundance. Specifically, overall shark abundance and diversity were significantly higher on the reef slope (and to a lesser degree, the back reef) than the reef flat. These results confirm that shark populations are not homogeneously distributed across coral reefs and also highlight the potential importance of the reef slope, with high levels of live coral cover, structural complexity, and diversity of potential prey species for sustaining reef shark populations. The goal of Chapter 4 was to examine the top-down influence of reef sharks and mesopredators (predatory teleost fishes) on herbivores across a large spatial gradient. The abundance, size structure, and biomass of apex predators, mesopredators, and herbivores across fished, no-take, and no-entry management zones of the GBR were estimated. Shark abundance and mesopredator size and biomass were higher in no-entry zones than in fished and no-take zones, which indicates the viability of strictly enforced human exclusion areas as tools for the conservation of predator communities. However, changes in predator populations due to protection in no-entry zones did not have a discernible influence on the density, size, or biomass of different functional groups of herbivorous fishes. The lack of a relationship between predators and herbivores suggests that top-down forces may be much weaker than previously thought and that food web models developed for terrestrial systems may not be appropriate for describing reef communities across large spatial scales. Using life-like models of a reef shark and another large predatory fish (coral-grouper), Chapter 5 examined the indirect effects of large predators on herbivore foraging behaviour and algal consumption. This study found that the presence of a model blacktip reef shark (1. 7 m length) or large coral-grouper (76 cm length) led to a substantial reduction in bite rate and species richness of herbivorous fishes feeding on a macroalgal thallus in the vicinity of the predator. The perceived risk of predation led to a near absolute localized cessation of macroagal removal. A smaller-sized model coral-grouper (48 cm length) also reduced herbivore diversity and activity but to a lesser degree than the larger model predators. These results highlight that the indirect effects of large predators on the foraging behaviour of herbivores may have flow-on effects on the biomass and distribution of macroalgae on a localized scale. Combined with the results of Chapter 4, this highlights that the ecological interactions and processes that contribute to ecosystem resilience may be more complex than previously assumed. Due to their large size and conspicuous predatory behaviour, reef sharks are typically assumed to be apex predators on coral reefs, but this title is tenuous because little is known about their trophic ecology and functional role. In Chapter 6 stomach contents and stable isotope ratios (δ 13 Carbon and δ 15 Nitrogen) were used to estimate diet, trophic level and sources of primary production of three reef sharks (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus and Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) from the GBR. Their assumed functional roles as apex predators were evaluated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other sharks and large predatory fishes. It was found that reef sharks do not occupy the apex of coral reef food chains, but instead appear to have functional roles similar to those of large predatory fishes, which are typically regarded as high-level mesopredators. These findings suggest that a high degree of functional redundancy may exist within this guild of large predators, potentially explaining why shark-induced trophic cascades are rare or subtle in coral reef ecosystems. Furthermore, these results indicate that reef sharks should be reassigned to an alternative trophic group such as mesopredators. This change will increase the accuracy of ecosystem models, providing resource managers with improved tools for understanding how reef communities function and how removal of predators might affect ecosystem properties. The current body of work has advanced our understanding of reef sharks, particularly in terms of their response to protection from fishing, spatial distribution, behaviour towards divers and their functional roles on coral reefs. This thesis demonstrates that reef sharks respond positively to protection from fishing but that the flow-on effects to lower trophic levels are variable and inconsistent with theory surrounding trophic cascades. These advances will be important for improving ecosystem-based management strategies that aim to conserve not only individual species, but also their functions and interactions. Such an approach is paramount given that coral reefs around the globe face ever-intensifying human-induced threats such as overfishing and climate change...|$|R
