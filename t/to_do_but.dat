5|$|The Swedes {{had fought}} bravely. Salzback had {{personally}} dispatched 8 men. But their losses were heavy, over 2,000 {{men had been}} killed, almost half the force while the allies had lost 1,900 men. The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition to withstand a siege. There was nothing for the Swedish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.|$|E

When further explosions within the catacombs scupper chances of deeper investigation, the surviving members of the team are left with nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> await the arrival of a Xeno rescue shuttle.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small <b>to</b> <b>do)</b> <b>but</b> not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the Crusaders {{intended}} {{to relieve the}} beleaguered Christian stronghold of Acre, but Louis had been diverted to Tunis. The French King and his brother Charles of Anjou, who had made himself King of Sicily, decided to attack the emirate to establish a stronghold in North Africa. The plans failed when the French forces were struck by an epidemic which, on 25August, took the life of King Louis himself. By the time Edward arrived at Tunis, Charles had already signed a treaty with the emir, and there was little else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> return to Sicily. The crusade was postponed until next spring, but a devastating storm {{off the coast of}} Sicily dissuaded Charles of Anjou and Louis's successor Philip III from any further campaigning. Edward decided to continue alone, and on 9May 1271he finally landed at Acre.|$|E

After having his {{assistant}} Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>but</b> Kenneth is inept and fails at the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with some ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests {{it was the right thing}} <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>but</b> Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E

5|$|In couples' counseling, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{have been}} told to express {{appreciation}} for the things their spouse does for them, be frank about things that make them unhappy, and refer to anything they do not want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> must as an opportunity. Their exercising of these three habits is stiff and formal to begin with, and becomes increasingly snarky as the day goes on. Despite this, as Jim leaves the office to return to his business, he confesses to Pam that he thinks the three habits are helping and that they should keep them up. After he leaves, Pam runs after him to give him an umbrella. Jim takes the umbrella, and then embraces his wife, who finds that she lacks the emotional conviction to hug him back. It then flashbacks to their wedding with Michael, Dwight and the gang, she remembers that by marrying Jim she promised to love him in spite of any hardships, and she lovingly embraces him and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} Western Europe had been {{stabilized}} after the Christianization of the Saxon, Viking, and Hungarian peoples {{by the end}} of the 10th century. However, the breakdown of the Carolingian Empire gave rise to an entire class of warriors who now had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> fight among themselves. The random violence of the knightly class was regularly condemned by the church, and in response it established the Peace and Truce of God to prohibit fighting on certain days of the year. At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the Holy Roman Emperors, resulting in the Investiture Controversy. Popes such as Gregory VII justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of Christendom, not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against Al-Andalus, or, theoretically, against the Seljuq dynasty in the east.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, {{he played}} in Non ci resta che piangere ("Nothing Left <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>but</b> Cry") with comic actor Massimo Troisi. The story was a fable in which the protagonists are {{suddenly}} thrown {{back in time to}} the 15th century, just a little before 1492. They start looking for Christopher Columbus in order to stop him from discovering the Americas (for very personal reasons), but are not able to reach him.|$|E
25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all that I have to say.

The film was not made but Fleischer instead directed two other stories for Zanuck starring Greco, Crack in the Mirror (1960) and The Big Gamble (1961).|$|E
25|$|In 1914, {{with the}} {{outbreak}} of war in Europe, Congress passed a law allowing foreign registered, foreign built ships belonging to United States companies to shift registry to the United States flag which the United Fruit Company had long wished to do, had sought a special act of Congress <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>but</b> had failed.

Despite seeing limited combat, Australian conduct in the field was considered to have been of a high standard, {{both in terms of}} military efficiency and discipline. Indeed, the ACH showed a level of professionalism perhaps unseen in previous Australian contingents.|$|E
25|$|The shutout win was the Patriots' {{first since}} 2006, while the Patriots' eight passing {{attempts}} were the second fewest in franchise history, behind only the three attempts in the Snowplow Game of 1982.

New England had done what they needed <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>but</b> unfortunately watched as Miami and Baltimore won their late games and left the Dolphins as the 2008 AFC East champs, the Ravens as a wild card team, and the Patriots missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 2002.|$|E

He was runner-up in the 2004 Welsh Open to O'Sullivan, losing 8–9 after having led 8–5. In 2005 he reached the quarter finals of the World Championship, losing to eventual winner Shaun Murphy.|$|E
