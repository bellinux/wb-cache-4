5|$|In October 1913, Tinker and Herrmann conferred, leading <b>to</b> <b>Tinker</b> {{signing a}} {{contract}} to remain the Reds manager for the 1914 season. However, Herrmann fired Tinker in November, leaving him to seek a contract from another team. Tinker complained that Herrmann did not seek his input on player transactions, while Herrmann charged that Tinker did not accept his authority.|$|E
5|$|Charles Ebbets, {{owner of}} the Brooklyn Dodgers, viewed Tinker as a good {{replacement}} for the released Bob Fisher, their shortstop in 1913. The Cubs, Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies were also interested in acquiring Tinker. Ebbets secured Tinker's release from the Reds for $15,000, with another $10,000 to be paid <b>to</b> <b>Tinker.</b> The teams also agreed to swap players, with Earl Yingling and Herbie Moran going to Cincinnati and Dick Egan joining Brooklyn. Ebbets entered contract negotiations with Tinker.|$|E

5|$|In 1988–89, the Flames {{continued}} to improve. They captured their second consecutive presidents' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points, finishing 26 points {{better than the}} second-place Kings in the Smythe Division. Fletcher continued <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> with the roster, acquiring Doug Gilmour {{as part of a}} six player deal at the trade deadline. In the playoffs, the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Vancouver Canucks. They relied on several saves by goaltender Mike Vernon, including a famous glove save off a Stan Smyl breakaway in overtime. The save remains a defining moment in Flames history.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
50|$|Retrofuturism also {{implies a}} reevaluation of technology. Unlike the total {{rejection}} of post-medieval technology {{found in most}} fantasy genres, or the embrace of any and all possible technologies found in some science-fiction, retrofuturism calls for a human-scale, largely comprehensible technology, amenable <b>to</b> <b>tinkering</b> and less opaque than modern black-box technology.|$|R

Beatrix threatens <b>to</b> kill <b>Tinker,</b> but Ronan convinces her <b>to</b> allow <b>Tinker</b> <b>to</b> use an invention that hacks into the building.

5|$|Huggins {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> {{with his}} roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary {{at third base}} and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as {{it became clear that}} the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, id Software {{released}} the much anticipated Quake. Like Doom, Quake was influential and genre-defining, featuring fast-paced, gory gameplay, but used 3D polygons instead of sprites. It was centered on online gaming and featured multiple match types still found in first-person shooter games today. It was the first FPS game to have a following of player clans (although the concept had existed previously in MechWarrior 2 (Netmech) with its Battletech lore as well as amongst MUD players), and would inspire popular LAN parties such as QuakeCon. The game's popularity and use of 3D polygonal graphics also helped to expand the growing market for video card hardware; and the additional support and encouragement for game modifications attracted players who wanted <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> with the game and create their own modules. According to creator John Romero, Quakes 3D world was inspired by the 3D fighting game Virtua Fighter. Quake was also intended to expand the genre with Virtua Fighter influenced melee brawling, but this was eventually dropped from the final game.|$|E
25|$|Griffith Stadium now had no tenants, and sat empty for years, deteriorating, {{with the}} field taking on the {{appearance}} of a prairie. The ballpark was demolished in 1965.

25|$|Western {{designers}} {{often feel}} the need <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design.|$|E
25|$|The United States District Court for the District of Alaska {{dismissed}} Frederick's case on summary judgment. The {{district court}} reasoned that Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>Tinker</b> v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, governed Frederick's school speech. Under this premise, the Court ruled that, given the stipulated facts, Morse {{and the school}} board had not infringed Frederick's First Amendment rights, because Morse had reasonably interpreted the banner as contravening the school's policies on drug abuse prevention.|$|E

25|$|Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen {{in for a}} rewrite {{when they}} were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had {{produced}} from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script they were happy with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began <b>to</b> <b>tinker</b> it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E

The second plot followed the characters' past journey in the Enchanted Forest and how they were brought back to Storybrooke by the Wicked Witch of the West, while also documenting Emma's mission to break the new Curse and save her family.
