40|$|New {{digital control}} {{algorithms}} {{were developed to}} achieve the desired acceleration transmissibility function. The attractive electromagnets have been taken as actuators. The relative displacement and the acceleration of the mass were used as feedback signals. Two approaches were developed to find that <b>controller</b> <b>transfer</b> function in Z-domain, which yields the desired transmissibility at each frequency. In the first approach, the <b>controller</b> <b>transfer</b> function is obtained by assuming that the desired transmissibility is known in Z-domain. Since the desired transmissibility H sub d(S) = 1 /(tauS+ 1) (exp 2) is given in S-domain, the first task is to obtain the desired transmissibility in Z-domain. There are three methods to perform this task: bilinear transformation, and backward and forward rectangular rules. The bilinear transformation and backward rectangular rule lead to improper <b>controller</b> <b>transfer</b> functions, which are physically not realizable. The forward rectangular rule does lead to a physically realizable controller. However, this controller {{is found to be}} marginally stable because of a pole at Z= 1. In order to eliminate this pole, a hybrid control structure is proposed. Here the control input is composed of two parts: analog and digital. The analog input simply represents the velocity (or the integral of acceleration) feedback; and the digital controller which uses only relative displacement signal, is then obtained to achieve the desired closed-loop transfer function. The stability analysis indicates that the <b>controller</b> <b>transfer</b> function is stable for typical values of sampling period. In the second approach, the aforementioned hybrid control structure is again used. First, an analog <b>controller</b> <b>transfer</b> function corresponding to relative displacement feedback is obtained to achieve the transmissibility as 1 /(tauS+ 1) (exp 2). Then the transfer function for the digital control input is obtained by discretizing this analog <b>controller</b> <b>transfer</b> function via bilinear transformation. The stability of the resulting Z-domain closed loop system is analyzed. Also, the frequency response of the Z-domain closed-loop transfer function is determined to evaluate the performance of the control system...|$|R
