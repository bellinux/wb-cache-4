At the time of electrification, KSS had 57 horsecars; 38 of these were later converted to trailers, while 19 were decommissioned. The John Stephenson and Skabo trailers were taken out of service in 1917–18, and sixteen of these were sold to the Bergen Tramway and Trondheim Tramway—the latter rebuilding them <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> gauge. One of the original Stephenson cars has been preserved at the Oslo Tramway Museum.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute.

25|$|Madaba Micro Private Sector Participation. In the Madaba Governorate, a {{different}} model of private sector participation (PSP), called Micro PSP, {{has been carried}} out starting in 2006. The Micro PSP involved outsourcing customer service operations to Engicon, a local operator hired on a three-year performance-based contract. Aims of the project were to improve water and wastewater revenue, to increase the billing rate and to develop the customer management organisation, thereby improving efficiency. To achieve this, Engicon trained staff, surveyed and mapped all subscribers and regulated routes <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> readers (to eliminate reader monopoly). The Micro-PSP with Engicon had a variety of positive effects for the Madaba Water Administration: As a result of the cooperation, the Madaba Water Administration could start issuing its own bills instead of having to rely on WAJ structures. The accuracy of meter reading improved and net billed water increased by 75%. Net collections increased from 0.9 million in 2005 to 1.9 million in 2008. The levels of non-revenue water (NRW) initially dropped from an average of 45% to 34%, but in 2009 they were back at 40% due to an increase in water pumping pressure. Advantages of the Micro-PSP model include the fact that WAJ maintained asset ownership and that all revenue collected went to WAJ, so that investment costs could be fully recovered within 13 months of operation. The performance-based contract set strong incentives for the private operator to deliver concrete results.|$|E
2500|$|Choreometrics {{tests the}} {{proposition}} that dance is the most repetitious, redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a culture... The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> and regulates, or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or explanation, is ready to act in concert.|$|E

Lecca was appreciated by critics in his 1890s context, winning the Romanian Academy's V. Adamachi Prize in 1898, and a Bene Merenti medal, conferred by King Carol I, in 1899. While Ilarie Chendi protested against Lecca's [...] "deranged inspiration", he qualified his verdict by insisting that it was nonetheless the inspiration of a [...] "refined artist". Inspiring in turn fellow authors such as Alexandru Toma, Lecca's poems were held in high regard by Hasdeu.

A three die set is needed for straight cases, while a two die set is used for bottlenecked cases. The first die of either set performs the sizing and decapping operation, except in some cases in the 3 die set, where decapping may be done by the second die. The middle die in a three-die set is used to expand the case mouth of straight cases (and decap in the case where this is not done by the first die), while in a two die set the entire neck is expanded as the case is extracted from the first die. The last die in the set seats the bullet and may apply a crimp. Special crimping dies are often used to apply a stronger crimp after the bullet is seated. Progressive presses sometimes use an additional [...] "die" [...] <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> powder into the case (though it is arguably not a real die as it does not shape the case).|$|E
2500|$|Time and tempo. While they absorbed severe blows at times, the VC/NVA {{had time}} on their side under the {{strategy}} of protracted conflict. Communist forces suffered some one million dead {{according to their own}} estimates [...] but this was relative in a conflict where manpower reserves were plentiful and key allies like China were providing tens of thousands of troops to keep border supply and transport routes open. Tempo manifested itself at the local level. Except for those times when they were forced into a battle by US sweeps, or during deployment for a major operation, Communist troops spent most of their time in area control and consolidation, not fighting. Overall, they controlled the initiative - when, where and with what intensity to strike. Tempo was also a factor in the long-term struggle. Communist forces were able <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> their losses as the conflict waxed and waned - depending on the political, diplomatic and military situation - scaling back after the setbacks of Tet, and increasing effort dramatically in 1972 and 1975, when the situation looked more favorable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quantity}} of gunpowder is specified by weight, but almost always measured by volume, especially in larger scale operations. A powder scale {{is needed to}} determine the correct mass thrown by the powder measure, as loads are specified with a precision of 0.10 grain (6.5mg). One grain is 1/7000 of a pound. Competition shooters will generally throw a slightly underweight charge, and use a powder trickler to add few s of powder at a time to the charge to bring it to the exact weight desired for maximum consistency. Special care is needed when charging large capacity cases with fast burning, low volume powders. In this instance, it is possible to put two charges of powder in a case without overflowing the case, which can lead to dangerously high pressures and a significant chance of bursting the chamber of the firearm. Non-magnum revolver cartridges are the easiest to do this with, as they generally have relatively large cases, and tend to perform well with small charges of fast powders. [...] Some powders meter (measure by volume) better than others due to the shape of each granule. [...] When using volume <b>to</b> <b>meter</b> each charge, it is important to regularly check the charge weight on a scale throughout the process.|$|E
