500|$|From the {{beginning}} of development, Vicious Cycle wanted players on all three consoles {{to be able to}} play against each other online. [...] This option was ultimately not implemented for the DS. [...] Lead designer Dave Ellis said [...] "...development time and platform limitations didn’t permit our DS developers <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> option, so the DS version was ultimately limited to Wi-Fi and online play with other DS players." [...] The PSP and PC versions allow players to use the same matchmaking system, and the game's code is linked so that if one platform is patched, the other must be as well. [...] Players with a PC can download and use the online component of the game for free.|$|E
500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> power.|$|E

However, after the band's 1997 releases, due to a desire to create more emotive and evolving music, the band decided to move in that direction. The first of said releases was an EP entitled Saw You Drown, released in early 1998, which also contained the first wide release of [...] "Scarlet Heavens". Later in 1998, the band released their first full-album of this style, titled Discouraged Ones.|$|E

2500|$|British {{political}} writer George Monbiot decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as {{an example}} of state persecution and the erosion of civil liberties in the United States, while journalist Amy Goodman characterized it as evidence of [...] "a new McCarthyism". Charles C Haynes, senior scholar at the First Amendment Center, also situated the controversy {{in the context of the}} freedom of expression debate, criticising the school for allowing a [...] "heckler's veto" [...] to censor Sierra and the school district for spending [...] "more than US$75,000 fighting to keep her quiet". A New York University drama project investigating post-9/11 America composed a theater piece, United We Stand, inspired by Sierra's actions. The Thomas Jefferson Center, an organization dedicated to the protection of freedom of expression, highlighted the controversy in 2002 and awarded the Kanawha school board and principal Forest Mann with their annual [...] "Jefferson Muzzle" [...] award. Highlighting a quote by Katie Sierra ("There are many types of anarchy. I want us to unite as one instead of having some government over top of us.") the center wrote, [...] "While school officials have the authority to prevent disruption of school activities, such authority should not be used as a pretext to stifle expression with which they disagree. Moreover, a high school student who shows an active interest in the important issues of the day and who takes the initiative to form a club <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> interest should be commended." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{wrote to}} Laurence on 22 February 1797 {{that he did}} not wish for a change in {{government}} lest it [...] "lead to a change in the constitution" [...] but agreed that a [...] "reform in the abuses of executive government" [...] was needed and that Fox would carry on the war [...] "for the same reason , and peace would be made by him more to advantage, because, made by him, there would be virtually a saving of the country's honour—made by Mr Pitt, the country is beat into it' made by Mr Fox it is a measure of choice". In March 1797 he looked with sympathy on a scheme by MPs and peers to form a government without Pitt and wrote a Memorial on the state of Ireland in which he called for Emancipation and the sacking of anti-Catholic members of the Irish government, which would reconcile Catholics to British rule and halt the spread of Jacobinism. He spoke in the Lords to put forward these proposals but it was rejected by 72 votes to 20. Fitzwilliam wrote on 2 April that he was [...] "the most isolated individual in politics in the king's dominions...a person who approves of nothing doing and therefore of no set of men whatever". The government had abandoned its principles and the Foxites were [...] "more hostile in ten times in my opinion, and more decided to act upon principles contrary to my views, than the Ministry". On 30 May Fitzwilliam met Burke at his home in Beaconsfield during his last illness before his death. Burke reported to Laurence that Fitzwilliam had [...] "a strong predilection to Mr Fox" [...] and [...] "influenced, too much so in my opinion, though very naturally and very excusably, by a rooted animosity against Mr Pitt". Fitzwilliam returned to his previous independence when the scheme for a [...] "third party" [...] collapsed and Laurence wrote to Fitzwilliam on 9 July (the day of Burke's death) that Burke had said on his deathbed: [...] "Inform Lord Fitzwilliam from me that it is my dying advice and request to him, steadily <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> course in which he now is. He can take no other that will not be unworthy of him". Laurence said [...] "this was almost if not quite the last thing which he said on public affairs".

Wolfenden set his face towards Deringham Hall and ran steadily along the road. He was filled with vague fears. The memory of Mr. Sabin's smile haunted him. He had succeeded. By what means? Perhaps by violence! Wolfenden forgot his own aching head. He was filled only with an intense anxiety to reach his destination. If Mr. Sabin had so much as raised his hand, he should pay for it.

60|$|This {{was true}} all round, as I very well knew, young as I was. Dirck, {{who was as}} slow-moving, as dull-seeming, and as anti-mercurial a boy to look at as one could find in a thousand, was {{thorough}} game at the bottom, {{and he had been}} at many a main, as he had told me himself. How much of his spirit was derived from witnessing such scenes I will not take on me to affirm; for, in these later times, I have heard it questioned whether such exhibitions do really improve the spectator's courage or not. But Dirck had pluck, and plenty of it, and in that particular, at least, his father was not mistaken. The Colonel's opinion always carried weight with my mother, both on account of his Dutch extraction, and on account of his well-established probity; for, to own the truth, a text or a sentiment from him had far more weight with her than the same from the clergyman. She was silenced on the subject of cock-fighting for the moment, therefore, which gave Capt. Hugh Roger further opportunity <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> of the English language. The grandfather, who was an inveterate lover of the sport, would have cut in to that branch of the discourse, but he had a great tenderness for my mother, whom everybody loved by the way, and he commanded himself, glad to find that so important an interest had fallen into hands as good as those of the Colonel. He would just as soon be absent from church as be absent from a cock-fight, and he was a very good observer of religion.|$|E
6000|$|Here, then, are {{the three}} {{greatest}} schools of the former world exemplified for you in three well-known works. The Phidian [...] "Theseus" [...] represents the Greek school pursuing truth of form; the [...] "Disputa" [...] of Raphael, the Florentine school pursuing truth of mental expression; the [...] "Marriage in Cana," [...] the Venetian school pursuing truth of colour and light. But do not suppose that the law which I am stating to you--the great law of art-life--can only be seen in these, {{the most powerful of}} all art schools. It is just as manifest in each and every school that ever has had life in it at all. Wheresoever the search after truth begins, there life begins; wheresoever that search ceases, there life ceases. As long as a school of art holds any chain of natural facts, trying to discover more of them and express them better daily, it may play hither and thither as it likes {{on this side of the}} chain or that; it may design grotesques and conventionalisms, build the simplest buildings, serve the most practical utilities, yet all it does will be gloriously designed and gloriously done; but let it once quit hold of the chain of natural fact, cease <b>to</b> <b>pursue</b> <b>that</b> as the clue to its work; let it propose to itself any other end than preaching this living word, and think first of showing its own skill or its own fancy, and from that hour its fall is precipitate--its destruction sure; nothing that it does or designs will ever have life or loveliness in it more; its hour has come, and there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither it goeth.|$|E
