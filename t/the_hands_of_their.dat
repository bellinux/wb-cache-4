5|$|Mary {{had always}} {{rejected}} the break with Rome instituted {{by her father}} {{and the establishment of}} Protestantism by her brother's regents. Philip persuaded Parliament to repeal Henry's religious laws, thus returning the English church to Roman jurisdiction. Reaching an agreement took many months and Mary and Pope Julius III had to make a major concession: the monastery lands confiscated under Henry were not returned to the church but remained in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> influential new owners. By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.|$|E
5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature {{composed of the}} Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers, a press that would enjoy a degree of freedom, and a provision that the Biens nationaux would remain in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> current owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism {{was to be the}} official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E

50|$|Elections in Northern Ireland {{are often}} characterised as mini-referendums on the {{constitutional}} question.

5|$|The {{severing}} of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These {{were sometimes}} {{cut off by}} rogue Force Publique soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> victims. These details were recorded by Christian missionaries working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known {{to the public in}} the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist E. D. Morel. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the Belgian Congo, and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive historiographical debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Indian {{independence}} in 1947, India was divided into two sets of territories, one under direct British rule, and the other under the suzerainty of the British Crown, with control over their internal affairs remaining in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hereditary rulers. In addition, there were several colonial enclaves controlled by France and Portugal. The political integration of these territories into India was a declared objective of the Indian National Congress, and the Government of India pursued this over the next decade. Through a combination of factors, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and V. P. Menon convinced the rulers of the various princely states to accede to India. Having secured their accession, they then proceeded, in a step-by-step process, to secure and extend the central government's authority over these states and transform their administrations until, by 1956, there was little difference between the territories that {{had been part of}} British India and those that had been part of princely states. Simultaneously, the Government of India, through a combination of diplomatic and military means, acquired de facto and de jure control over the remaining colonial enclaves, which too were integrated into India.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{there were}} no {{essential}} doctrinal differences with the Wesleyans, Primitive Methodism was shaped by the experience of vilification shared by Bourne, Clowes, and others. Thus, whereas the Wesleyans concentrated {{a great deal of}} authority in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Ministers, the Primitive Methodists chose instead to trust the role of lay people.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the theme}} played out in Judges: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he {{therefore}} delivers them into <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends {{in the form of}} a judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, but after a while they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in {{part and}} {{reversed}} in part, upholding {{all of the}} regulations except for the husband notification requirement. The Third Circuit concluded that the husband notification was unduly burdensome because it potentially exposed married women to spousal abuse, violence, and economic duress at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> husbands. Then-Circuit Judge Samuel Alito sat on that three-judge appellate panel and dissented from the court's invalidation of that requirement.|$|E

2500|$|In 66 CE, the Jews of Judea rose in {{revolt against}} Rome, naming their new kingdom [...] "Israel" [...] (see also First Jewish Revolt coinage).

60|$|Upon {{all these}} accounts, I say, I could wish, {{when we were}} recovered, our conduct had been more {{distinguished}} for charity and kindness in remembrance of the past calamity, {{and not so much}} a valuing ourselves upon our boldness in staying, as if all men were cowards that fly from <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> God, or that those who stay do not sometimes owe their courage to their ignorance, and despising <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> Maker--which is a criminal kind of desperation, and not a true courage.|$|R
25|$|The Jacksonville Jaguars {{had been}} one of the NFL's best teams in the 1999 season, pacing the AFC with a 14–2 record. However, both of those losses came at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> opponents in the AFC Championship Game, the Tennessee Titans. The Titans would prove up to the task of beating their {{division}} rival once again as the Titans scored a resounding 33–14 victory. The Titans advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history by forcing six turnovers and a safety.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th {{century the}} whole area changed {{dramatically}} in all possible aspects: linguistic, cultural, political, etc. During that period the Kingdom of Georgia turned into an isolated, fractured Christian enclave, {{a relic of the}} faded East Roman epoch surrounded by a Muslim, predominantly Turco-Iranian world. During the three subsequent centuries, the Georgian rulers maintained their perilous autonomy as subjects under the Turkish Ottoman and Iranian Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar domination, although sometimes serving as little more than puppets in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> powerful suzerains.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2nd century BC, Gaius Marius {{reformed}} {{the previously}} ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for jobless citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> general rather than the State of Rome itself. This development ultimately enabled Julius Caesar to cross the Rubicon with an army loyal to him personally and effectively end the Republic.|$|E

25|$|On {{their way}} back, the Cherokee took some stray horses in Virginia to replace those they had lost. Virginia {{settlers}} got angry and banded together, pursuing the Cherokee, attacking them and killing, scalping and mutilating 20 of the Indians, later collecting the bounty offered for enemy scalps. Although Dinwiddie, {{the lieutenant governor}} of Virginia, apologized some Virginians considered them horse thieves. Some Cherokees and Moytoy (Amo-adawehi) of Citico retaliated for the murders of Cherokee warriors at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> colonial allies and the situation escalated.|$|E

Same-sex partners are excluded from the Law for the Prevention of Spousal Violence and the Protection of Victims and generally lack safe places where they can seek help and support. Japan is {{a party to the}} United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which also comprehensively bans discrimination.|$|E
