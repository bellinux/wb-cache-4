5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> X-rays {{have the}} same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to hydrostatic equilibrium, {{the interior of}} a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. <b>The</b> <b>outgoing</b> flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the line had not been well executed, and maintenance costs were considerable; in addition the three stationary engines were expensive to operate. The shortage of capital {{at the time of}} building the line had resulted in heavy loans being taken. The agricultural traffic from Strathmore had not developed as much as had been forecast, so that the lower income and the weekly burden of <b>the</b> <b>outgoings</b> was a serious problem. Operating expenses were high, at 83% of gross revenue; every train required five engines: the three stationary engines and two on the level sections. <b>The</b> <b>outgoings</b> left inadequate funds to service the loan debt.|$|R

5|$|Gladstone {{returned}} to power after the 1892 general election; he was 82 years old.

In 1894, Gladstone retired and, without consulting <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> prime minister, Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister. His government was weak, and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister {{for the remainder of}} Victoria's reign.|$|E

The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall {{was a result of}} unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes.

With the aid of his close friend Timothy Pickering, who was serving as U.S. Secretary of State, Harrison received a recommendation to replace Withrop Sargent, <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> territorial secretary. President John Adams appointed Harrison to the position in July 1798. Harrison frequently served as acting territorial governor during the absences of Governor Arthur St. Clair.|$|E

5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (<b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was {{at first}} seen as an {{improvement}} over the Catholic Thomas Dongan, <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> governor. However, the province's old guard was unhappy that Andros removed all of the provincial records to Boston, and then Nicholson alarmed the sometimes hardline Protestant population by preserving the trappings of the chapel in Fort James that Dongan and the handful of New York's Catholics had used for worship. In response to a rumored Dutch invasion of England (a rumor {{that turned out to}} be true), Nicholson in January 1689 ordered the provincial militias to be on alert to protect the province for the king. Unknown to Nicholson, events in England had already changed things.|$|E

He made his league debut for the club on 1 September, starting in a 0–0 draw with Fortuna Düsseldorf. Three games later, Domínguez scored his first goal for the club, netting an extra-time equalizer in 2–2 draw against Hamburg. He ultimately made 40 appearances and scored two goals across all competitions for the season as Gladbach finished eighth in the Bundesliga.|$|E

50|$|In this stage, all nodes in the {{fragment}} cooperate to find <b>the</b> minimum weight <b>outgoing</b> edge of <b>the</b> fragment. <b>Outgoing</b> edges are edges connecting to other fragments. The messages sent {{in this stage}} are {{in the opposite direction}} of the broadcast stage. Initialized by all the leaves (the nodes that have only one branch edge), a message is sent through the branch edge. The message contains the minimum weight of <b>the</b> incident <b>outgoing</b> edge it found (or infinity if no such edge was found). The way to find <b>the</b> minimum <b>outgoing</b> edge will be discussed later. For each non-leaf node, (let the number of its branch edges be n) after receiving n-1 convergecast messages, it will pick the minimum weight from the messages and compare it to the weights of its incident <b>outgoing</b> edges. <b>The</b> smallest weight will be sent toward the branch it received the broadcast from.|$|R

Menem's accession marked the first time since Hipólito Yrigoyen took office in 1916 that an incumbent government was peacefully succeeded by a president from an opposition party.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} maximal {{directed}} pseudoforests on n vertices, allowing self-loops, is nn, because for each vertex there are n possible endpoints for <b>the</b> <b>outgoing</b> edge. André Joyal used this fact {{to provide a}} bijective proof of Cayley's formula, {{that the number of}} undirected trees on n nodes is n'n2, by finding a bijection between maximal directed pseudoforests and undirected trees with two distinguished nodes. If self-loops are not allowed, the number of maximal directed pseudoforests is instead (n1)n.|$|E
