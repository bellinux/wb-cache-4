500|$|On 7 January 2006, {{three days}} before the auction of the final 1,000 pixels was due to end, Tew {{received}} an e-mail from an organisation called [...] "The Dark Group", and was told The Million Dollar Homepage would become the victim of a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) if a ransom of $5,000 was not paid by 10 January. Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: [...] "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS send us 50000$." [...] Again, he ignored the threat, and the website was flooded with extra traffic and e-mails, causing it to crash. [...] "I haven't replied to any of <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> don't want to give them the satisfaction and I certainly don't intend to pay them any money. What is happening to my website is like terrorism. If you pay them, new attacks will start," [...] Tew said.|$|E
500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have been and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'. Really miserable and down because I'm in the red, and the bills are coming in, poor old Lil [...] suffers as I don't want to get a rise. Not really true don't want to ask for a rise, fellows are having a pretty tough time as it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|What {{men they}} were, these Boers! I thought of <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen them}} in the morning riding forward through the rain—thousands of {{independent}} riflemen, thinking for themselves, possessed of beautiful weapons, led with skill, living as they rode without commissariat or transport or ammunition column, moving like the wind, and supported by iron [...] constitutions and a stern, hard Old Testament God.|$|E
2500|$|Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, {{had another}} note {{attached}} to it: [...] "I've sealed the previous fifty pages {{in an envelope}} as finished.

[...] There is an inscription on the envelope: [...] "These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> asked her to.

6000|$|... "I didn't {{get to see}} <b>'em,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{only put}} up my hoss there," [...] he replied. [...] "But I know the stage took some away this mornin': it seemed pretty well loaded up when I passed it." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Along {{with the}} blue shirts, the red ties, the clenched fists, the raised arm salute, came the banners, the slogans, the demonstrations; all the trappings that make for totalitarian, unthinking mass fervor. These now became regular {{features}} at party gatherings. I can still recall the howl of triumph that rose from these young people at one of our meetings when {{for the first time}} Norman Thomas returned the clenched fist salute to <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>I</b> stood at his side, my arms deliberately folded to indicate that I would have no part of this, their cheers for Thomas rose to almost uncontrollable frenzy." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Speed is everything," [...] Goetz {{said in a}} videotaped {{statement}} {{made after}} he surrendered nine days later. He told police that while still seated, he planned a [...] "pattern of fire" [...] from left to right. He then stood, stepped clear of Canty, drew his revolver, turned back to Canty, and fired four shots, one at each man, then fired a fifth shot. At the civil trial years later he said, [...] "I {{was trying to get}} as many of <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could." [...] Other sources repeated Goetz's statements to New York City police as to the sequence of shots: Canty was shot first, then Allen, then Ramseur, then Cabey. In the related proceeding People v. Goetz, the New York Court of Appeals summarized the incident: ...|$|E
2500|$|In Bishop White's {{response}} of August 15, 1835 to Colonel Mercer of Fredericksburg, Virginia, he writes: [...] "In {{regard to the}} subject of your inquiry, truth requires me to say that General Washington never received the communion in the churches of which I am the parochial minister. [...] Mrs. Washington was an habitual communicant...I have been written to by many on that point, and have been obliged to answer <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> now do you." [...] This letter is one piece of evidence among many which are frequently cited in support of Washington's deist or even atheist beliefs. [...] Although Washington never received communion there, he attended services at Christ Church regularly for about 25 years. [...] (See also: George Washington and religion) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the version}} of the First Vision (first {{published}} in 1842) that has been canonized by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), his family's decision to join the Presbyterian Church occurs prior to his First Vision. However, Lucy Mack Smith said that she {{and some of her}} children sought comfort in the church after the death of her oldest son, Alvin, in November 1823, which, if her memory was correct, would place the date of the first vision no earlier than 1824. In 1845, Lucy recalled that she tried to persuade her [...] "husband to join with <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wished to do so myself." [...] Her three oldest children Hyrum, Samuel, and Sophronia also joined the Presbyterian church, but [...] "the two Josephs resisted her enthusiasm." [...] D. Michael Quinn says that Smith's account is a conflation of events over several years, a typical biographical device for streamlining the narrative.|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, Norris {{wrote on}} her website that the {{response}} to her idea had surprised and shocked her: [...] "I did not intend for my cartoon to go viral. I {{did not intend to}} be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the First Amendment by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!" [...] On April 26, she wrote on her website: [...] "I am NOT involved in [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammd [...] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am a private person who draws stuff". She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, [...] "Because I'm an idiot." ...|$|E
