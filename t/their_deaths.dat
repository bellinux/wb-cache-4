5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries meet <b>their</b> <b>deaths</b> at {{the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and <b>their</b> <b>deaths</b> often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met <b>their</b> <b>deaths</b> through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E

60|$|Thus you see <b>their</b> <b>death</b> {{is before}} <b>their</b> {{deliverance}}. Also <b>their</b> <b>death</b> {{is to be}} by {{the hand of the}} beast; to wit by the men that have and hold his mark, and that of his image, and that are of the number of his name. You see also that <b>their</b> <b>death</b> is not only a forerunner of their deliverance, but a sign that their deliverance is at the door; since the one is but three days and an half before the other.|$|R

60|$|For {{comparing}} {{their life}} with <b>their</b> <b>death,</b> <b>their</b> sinful, cursed lives, with <b>their</b> childlike, lamblike <b>death,</b> {{they think that}} all is well, that no damnation is happened to them; though they lived like devils incarnate, yet they died like harmless ones. there was no whirlwind, no tempest, no band or plague in <b>their</b> <b>death.</b> They died as quietly as the most godly of them all, and had as great faith and hope of salvation, and would talk as boldly of salvation {{as if they had}} assurance of it. But as was their hope in life, so was their death; their hope was without trial, because it was none of God's working, and <b>their</b> <b>death</b> was without molestation, because so was the judgment of God concerning them.|$|R

After hearing of <b>their</b> <b>deaths,</b> Jane and Mary travelled back to Pisa for the funerals of their husbands; Williams and Shelley were cremated on consecutive days in August 1822. After Shelley's cremation, Jane was forced to settle a dispute between Mary Shelley and Leigh Hunt over what to do with what they believed was the unburnt heart of Percy Shelley. Though Hunt had initially taken it from Shelley's pyre, Mary insisted that he return it to her. Though Hunt was initially unwilling to do so, Jane later convinced him that it should be returned. Mary Shelley and Jane Williams briefly settled in Albaro, before proceeding to Genoa together. There they separated in September due to Jane's desire to quickly return to England. Jane brought Edward's ashes with her back to England.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{is among}} those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after <b>their</b> <b>deaths.</b> The vindication of Maximus' {{theological}} position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death, and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb.
