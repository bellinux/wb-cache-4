50|$|Plotting {{the angle}} of the target was a simple process of taking the gonio reading and setting a {{rotating}} straightedge to that value. The problem was determining where along that straightedge the target lay; the radar measured the slant range straight-line distance to the target, not the distance over the ground. That distance was affected by the target's altitude, which had to be determined by taking the somewhat time-consuming altitude measurements. Additionally, that altitude was affected by the range, due to the curvature of the Earth, as well as any imperfections in the local environment, which caused the lobes to have different measurements depending on the <b>target</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
50|$|This section {{describes}} {{the principles of}} the radar-scan conversion (RSC) process.The radar supplies its measured data in polar coordinates (ρ,θ) directly from the rotating antenna. ρ defines the target/echo distance and θ the <b>target</b> <b>angle</b> in polar world coordinates. These data are measured, digitized and stored in a polar coordinate polar store or polar pixmap. The main RSC task is to convert these data to Cartesian (x, y) display coordinates, creating the necessary display pixels. The RSC process is influenced by the current zoom, shift and rotation settings defining which part of the 'world' shall be visible in the display image. As detailed later the RSC process also takes the currently used geographical projection into account when the radar video images are Geo Warped.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} how display parameters influence humans’ {{ability to control}} simulated egorotations from optic flow. The literature on visual turn perception reports contradictory data, which might be {{partly due to the}} different display devices used in these studies. In this study, we aimed at disentangling the influence of display devices, screen curvature, and field of view (FOV) on the ability to control simulated ego-rotations solely from visual information. In Experiment 1, FOV and display device (projection screen vs. head-mounted display (HMD)) was manipulated. In Experiment 2, screen curvature and FOV were varied. Subjects’ task was to perform visually simulated self-rotations with <b>target</b> <b>angles</b> between 45 and 270 degree. Stimuli consisted of limited lifetime dots on a dark background, and subjects used a joystick to control the turning angle of the visual stimulus. In Experiment 1, performance was tested in a within-subject design, using a curved projection screen (FOV 84 degree × 63 degree), a HMD (40 degree × 30 degree), and blinders (40 degree × 30 degree) that restricted the FOV on the screen. Performance was best with the screen (gain factor 0. 77) and worst with the HMD (gain 0. 57). We found a significant difference between blinders (gain 0. 73) and HMD, which indicates that different display devices can influence ego-motion perception differentially, even if the physical FOVs are equal. In Experiment 2, screen curvature was found to influence the perception of ego-rotations: At identical FOVs of 84 degree, participants undershot <b>target</b> <b>angles</b> on the curved screen (gain 0. 84), while they overshot <b>target</b> <b>angles</b> on the flat screen (gain 1. 08). Perceptual mechanisms that may underlie these results will be discussed. We conclude the following: First, differences between display devices (HMD vs. curved projection screen) are more critical than the FOV for the perception of ego-rotations, with projection screens being better than HMDs. Second, screen curvature significantly influences performance for visually simulated egorotations: Compared to the flat screen, the curved screen enhanced the perception of ego-rotations. These findings have relevant implications for the design of motion simulators...|$|R
40|$|A Laser Inertial Fusion Energy (LIFE) target’s flight {{through a}} low Reynolds number and high Mach number regime was {{analyzed}} with {{computational fluid dynamics}} software. This regime consisted of xenon gas at 1, 050 K and approximately 6, 670 Pa. Simulations with similar flow conditions were performed over a sphere and compared with experimental data and published correlations for validation purposes.

Simulations with different <b>target</b> <b>angles</b> of attack were used to determine the aerodynamic coefficients of drag, lift, Magnus moment, and overturning moment as well as target stability. The drag force, lift force, and overturning moment changed minimally with spin. Above an angle of attack of 15 °, the overturning moment would be destabilizing. At angles of attack less than 15 °, the overturning moment would tend to decrease the <b>target’s</b> <b>angle</b> of attack, indicating the lack of a need for spin for stability at these small angles. This stabilizing moment would cause the target to move in a mildly damped oscillation about the axis parallel to the free-stream velocity vector through the target’s center of gravity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this study, we {{demonstrate}} {{a new approach}} to autonomous folding for the body of a 3 D robot from a 2 D sheet using heat. We approach this challenge by folding a 0. 27 mm sheet-like material into a structure. We utilize the thermal deformation of a contractive sheet sandwiched by rigid structural layers. During this “baking ” process, the heat applied on the entire sheet induces contraction of the contracting layer and, thus, forms an instructed bend in the sheet. To attain the <b>targeted</b> folding <b>angles,</b> the V-fold Spans method is used. The <b>targeted</b> <b>angle</b> θout can be kinematically encoded into crease geometry. The realization of this angle in the folded structure can be approximately controlled by a contraction angle θin. The process is non-reversible, is reliable, and it is relatively fast. Our method can be applied simultaneously to all the folds in multi-creased origami structures. We demonstrate the use of this method to create a light-weight mobile robot. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{and accuracy of}} sound localization by the barn owl (Tyto alba) were studied by exploiting the natural head-orienting response of the owl to novel sound stimuli. Head orientation and movement were measured using an adaptation of the search coil technique which provided continuous high resolution azimuthal and elevational information during the behavior. The owls responded to sound sources with a quick, stereotyped head saccade; the median latency of the response was 100 ms, and its maximum angular velocity was 790 °/s. The head saccade terminated at a fixation point which was used to quantify the owl's sound localization accuracy. When the sound target was located frontally, the owl's localization error was less than 2 ° in azimuth and elevation. This accuracy is superior to that of all terrestrial animals tested to date, including man. When the owls were performing open-loop localization (stimulus off before response begins), their localization errors increased as the angular distance to the target increased. Under closed-loop conditions (stimulus on throughout response), the owls again committed their smallest errors when localizing frontal targets, but their errors increased only out to <b>target</b> <b>angles</b> of 30 °. At <b>target</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 30 °, the owl's localization errors were independent of target location.
