The size of procurement spending stands in most developed economies at double-digit percentage points of GDP. However, despite the size and importance of these markets, the factual information available to trade negotiators remains scarce. Although public procurement patterns (e. g. size of procurement markets, composition of procurement spending and level of government procurement) can be derived from <b>traditional</b> <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> statistics, these figures fall short of capturing the international dimension of public procurement. Hence, the paper puts forward a basic conceptual framework for data collection on public procurement that would best serve the future negotiating agenda in this area...|$|E

It uses the case of an oil producer, Venezuela, to show how <b>traditional</b> <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> exaggerated the income of resource-based economies. The experience of Venezuela also serves to prove that a country can endure negative genuine savings {{for long periods of time}} without experiencing declining consumption. This is explained not in terms of the theoretical capital gains from trade due to increasing scarcity of the resource but from the presence of technological change that increased the amounts available for exploitation. * At the time of completing this paper the author was PhD candidate at the London School of Economics and Fulbright Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley.

40|$|Environmental {{accounting}} literature {{reminds us}} that prosperity can be ephemeral if it is built on depletion of natural resources. <b>Traditional</b> <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> practice ignores the loss of natural resources. According to standard environmental accounting, this produces exaggerated income, encourages unsustainable levels of consumption and is misleading when assessing the economic prospects of resource extracting countries. While the historiography of oil-extracting countries departs from entirely different concepts and methods, it contains plenty of arguments that resemble those of the environmental accountants. Nonetheless the arguments in the historiography lack quantitative support for the most part. This article connects these previously disparate literatures and explores the resulting synergies. Doing so, it contributes to the surprisingly small amount of comparative historical studies of the oil industries and the economic histories of Venezuela and Mexico, but overall, this study is {{an examination of the}} tractability and usefulness of environmental accounting as a tool of economic analysis over the long run.

A large quantity of goods and services are produced by household members for their own consumption, without involving market transactions.

Agriculture is no longer {{considered to be an}} environmentally friendly activity. In Bangladesh, efforts to feed an ever-increasing population have meant unsustainable farming practices and a steady depletion of the resource base. The quality of the environment has been degraded and ability of the future generations compromised. This calls for “greening” of GDP by deducting negative changes in environmental quality in national income calculation. This paper begins by developing an environmental account for Bangladesh's agricultural sector. This is done by collecting physical data on depletion and degradation of environmental resources and then estimating their costs by appropriate valuation techniques. The environmentally adjusted agricultural sector is then integrated with a Social Accounting Matrix. Finally, sectoral products for agriculture and forestry are estimated net of environmental cost. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{monetary}} theory of business cycles as presented by the so called Austrian school of economics. It analyzes the different economic effects of investments financed by saving as opposed to investments financed by credit expansion. It shows that {{in the latter case}} an unsustainable situation results in which economic actors try both to invest and to consume more at the same time, which is physically impossible. The result is recession and liquidation of malinvestments made during the boom. The thesis also provides an answer to critiques of the Austrian business cycle theory by proponents of the rational expectations hypothesis. Furthermore, a critique of <b>traditional</b> <b>national</b> income <b>accounting</b> measures, namely GDP, is put forward. These measures fail to adequately show the described cyclical changes in the economy's productive structure, e. g. the artificial boom and subsequent correction.

40|$|Economics {{and ecology}} are often {{presented}} as opposing disciplines. Both fields have strengths and weaknesses. A new transdisciplinary field, ecological economics, attempts {{to bring together}} the strengths of both disciplines with a vision for a sustainable future. In this paper, we focus on one particular concept championed by ecological economists, natural capital. In particular, our interest is on the institutionalization of this concept through the United Nation&# 039;s Satellite System for Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA). SEEA is an international convention that incorporates natural resource accounting as a complement to the <b>traditional</b> System of <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> (SNA). In the case of boreal forests, the stocks and flows of forest resources can be assessed to determine prospects for sustainability. To provide a context for how natural resource accounting may be applied to boreal forests, we review the origin and purpose of natural resource accounting, summarize several cases in which natural resource accounting has been applied, and present an example of stocks and flows from Michigan&# 039;s (United States) boreal forest resources. Natural resource accounting work from Canada, Finland, Norway, and other countries with boreal forests should be compiled and analyzed to provide more insights regarding circumpolar forest conditions...|$|R
