5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite <b>the</b> <b>deregulation</b> {{of the market}} in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have free competition, since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E

5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours, {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After <b>the</b> <b>deregulation,</b> Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>deregulation</b> of {{the airline}} market in 1994, which allowed any European Economic Area-airline to operate any route they wished, Teddy Air tried to start {{services}} at Moss Airport, Rygge. Since {{it at the time}} was the military-only Rygge Air Station, with no passenger facilities, the airline was not successful in receiving permission. However, it did choose to start competing with Air Stord on the Skien–Bergen route, starting 8May 1995. Using its Embraer 110 aircraft, it launched tickets for under NOK1000, compared with the NOK1290 price offered by Air Stord. The latter had aircraft half the size, but offered 31 flights per week, compared to the 16 offered by Teddy Air. In addition, Coast Air launched two weekly round trips. The routes were mainly used by commuters working on offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. By 1995, 60 percent {{of the airline}} had been bought by Hermann Løvenskiold.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Braathens SAFE {{started its}} first {{international}} scheduled service since 1960, from Fornebu to Billund in Denmark. Two years later, the company started flying to Newcastle, after Dan-Air had {{withdrawn from the}} route, and to Malmö in Sweden. That year also saw the start of Norway Airlines, who started a base at Fornebu and offered flights to London-Gatwick, {{as well as to}} Stockholm, in cooperation with Transwede, and to Copenhagen, in cooperation with Sterling Airlines. In 1992, both Norway Airlines and Dan-Air went bankrupt, and Braathens SAFE started flights to London-Gatwick. It terminated the Malmö route in 1994. After <b>the</b> <b>deregulation,</b> Braathens SAFE also introduced flights to Alicante, Málaga, Rome and Stockholm. Widerøe introduced international services to Gothenburg and Berlin.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} announced the aviation deregulation policy, {{which makes it}} easier to acquire a permit to establish a new airline company. The policy was meant to stimulate air transportation investments and increase air-travel business in the country, as well as to serve and stimulate tourism industry in the region. As a result, many new airlines began to spring up in Indonesia, among them Lion Air (est. 1999), Sriwijaya Air (est. 2003), Adam Air (operating from 2002 to 2008), and Batavia Air (operating from 2002 to 2013). <b>The</b> <b>deregulation</b> also spurred the low-cost carrier service in Indonesia.

5|$|Teddy Air AS was a {{regional}} airline, based at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen, in Norway. Operating between 1989 and 2004, the company operated Britten-Norman Islander, Embraer 110 and Saab 340 aircraft. The company started {{by providing a}} scheduled service between Skien and Oslo in 1990, followed by services to Stavanger in 1993 and Bergen in 1994. In 1996, it won {{a contract with the}} Ministry of Transport from Oslo to Fagernes. It was involved in intense competition with other regional airlines, notably Coast Air and Guard Air, following <b>the</b> <b>deregulation</b> of the aviation market. It also had a single international service to Gothenburg, and from 1999 it served Stord Airport, Sørstokken. From 1999, the company was transformed to a virtual airline, which wet leased aircraft from Golden Air. The company ceased operations in 2004.|$|E

In 1960, with <b>the</b> <b>deregulation</b> of the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the trolleybus networks. Tracks would be kept and trams would run until they would be naturally retired. However, no major investments would {{be made in the}} lines or rolling stock. Within a year, the Kampen, Rodeløkka, Vippetangen, Simensbråten and Vestbanen Lines were closed, as were trolleybus lines 18 and 24. The remaining two trolleybus routes were closed in 1968. On 24 June 1968, Vålerenga Line was closed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deregulation</b> process, {{which would}} {{eliminate}} the need for concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the EU. This was supported by the Labor Party and the right-winged Conservative Party and Progress Party. The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be deregulated from 1 January 1993, with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July. Full, domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997. SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997, which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines, rather than these two, until then. SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993, while Braathens SAFE stated that it no longer was in favor of competition, despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company's history. The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes, that were being cross-subsidized, being closed. SAS stated that with competition, prices would fall 20–30%, and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{globalisation}} {{has been a}} widely discussed topic {{over the past two}} decades, and a great enabler and driving force behind this process has been the airline industry. In addition, deregulation is said to have a great impact on company performance and profitability, and is often associated with being a direct consequence of globalisation. This paper examines the US and the EU airline industry with the intent to test <b>the</b> consequences of <b>deregulation.</b> We document that the two regions deregulated their respective markets differently in time; the US deregulated in 1979 and the EU gradually from 1985 to 1997. We test the two markets concerning profit margin, before and after <b>the</b> final EU <b>deregulation</b> in 1997. <b>The</b> evidence indicates that US airlines have a higher profit margin than their European counterparts, both before and after <b>the</b> EU <b>deregulation.</b> In addition, we find no indication that the EU airlines improved in profitability after <b>the</b> final <b>deregulation.</b> Finally, we find that different variables affect profit margin differently in the two markets...|$|R
