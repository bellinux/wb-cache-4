She worked with him on such plays as Happy Days (their third project) and Krapp's Last Tape at the Royal Court Theatre. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: [...] "She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this has never been the case with Jocelyn." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robertson is {{credited}} as writer or co-writer {{of the majority}} of The Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, , Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that The Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: [...] "I think Levon's book hits <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band.... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble." [...] Robertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson, and his daughter Alexandra later remarked {{in a letter to the}} Los Angeles Times that Helm's solo work consists almost entirely of songs written by others.|$|E

50|$|There is {{some debate}} about whether a dewclaw helps dogs to gain {{traction}} when they run because, in some dogs, the dewclaw makes contact when they are running and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dewclaw often wears down {{in the same way}} that <b>the</b> <b>nails</b> <b>on</b> their other toes do from contact with the ground.
