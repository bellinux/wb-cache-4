5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E

25|$|Most RISC {{architectures}} have fixed-length instructions (commonly 32 bits) and {{a simple}} encoding, which simplifies fetch, decode, and issue logic considerably.

To address this problem, several architectures, such as ARM, Power ISA, MIPS, RISC-V, and the Adapteva Epiphany, have an optional short feature-reduced instruction format or instruction compression feature.

25|$|Modern {{pharmaceutical}} {{therapy has}} resulted in an overall reduction in hypertension, particularly in countries with high GDP per capita. A review of blood pressure statistics before these pharmaceuticals were available shows a coherent correlation between {{high blood pressure and}} higher latitude. Seasons of the year also impact high blood pressure; BP is lower in the summer months in high latitudes <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter, when there is less sunlight. Individuals with more sun exposure synthesize more active vitamin D (1,25 di-hydroxy cholecalciferol) from diet or ultraviolet radiation exposure. A combination of lower ultraviolet radiation with insufficient vitamin D in a diet leads to vitamin D deficiency. Individuals whose vitamin D ranks in the lowest quartile have double the all-cause mortality of those who rank in the highest quartile.

25|$|The perception, {{more than}} the reality, of science fiction series being {{cancelled}} unreasonably is greatly increased by the attachment of fans to their favorite series, which is much stronger in science fiction fandom <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general population. While mainstream shows are often more strictly episodic, where ending shows can allow viewers to imagine that characters live happily, or at least normally, ever after, science fiction series generate questions and loose ends that, when unresolved, cause dissatisfaction among devoted viewers. Creative settings also often call for broader story arcs than is often found in mainstream television, requiring science fiction series many episodes to resolve an ongoing major conflict. Science fiction television producers will sometimes end a season with a dramatic cliffhanger episode to attract viewer interest, but the short-term effect rarely influences financial partners. Dark Angel {{is one of many}} shows ending with a cliffhanger scene that left critical questions open when the series was cancelled.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the energy and comfort impact of the HVAC equipment granularity in offices through building performance simulation. To this end, the occupancy data gathered from 37 private offices <b>in</b> Ottawa, Canada <b>were</b> analysed. For each occupant, four parameters that play an important role over the HVAC operation were extracted. These parameters are the earliest expected arrival time, the latest expected departure time, the latest expected arrival time, and the longest expected duration of intermediate vacancy. Through random sampling from the 37 occupants, hypothetical zones with varying numbers of occupants were created, and EnergyPlus simulations were conducted. Results indicate that the earliest expected arrival time <b>in</b> one-person zones <b>is</b> on average two hours later <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> twelve-person zones. Similarly, the latest expected departure time <b>in</b> one-person zones <b>is</b> on average two hours earlier <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> twelve-person zones.

25|$|It is {{straightforward}} to show that, in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, sufficiently large sets of points {{will have a}} subset of k points that forms the vertices of a convex polytope, for any k greater than the dimension: this follows immediately from existence of convex k-gons in sufficiently large planar point sets, by projecting the higher-dimensional point set into an arbitrary two-dimensional subspace. However, the number of points necessary to find k points in convex position may be smaller in higher dimensions <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane, {{and it is possible}} to find subsets that are more highly constrained. In particular, in d dimensions, every d+3 points in general position have a subset of d+2 points that form the vertices of a cyclic polytope. More generally, for every d and k>d there exists a number m(d,k) such that every set of m(d,k) points in general position has a subset of k points that form the vertices of a neighborly polytope.|$|E

500|$|In the Köppen–Geiger {{classification}} system, Istanbul has a borderline Mediterranean climate (Csa), humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa) and oceanic climate (Cfb), {{due to its}} location in a transitional climatic zone.

Due to its size, diverse topography, maritime location and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of water {{to the north and}} south, Istanbul exhibits microclimates. The northern half of the city, as well as the Bosporus coastline, express characteristics of oceanic and humid subtropical climates, because of humidity from the Black Sea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation.
