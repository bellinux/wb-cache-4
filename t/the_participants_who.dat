5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
5|$|The first {{atomic bombs}} were {{developed}} by the wartime Manhattan Project. This {{was carried out in}} secret, lest its discovery induce the Axis powers, particularly Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects, or undertake covert operations against the project. The military and scientific leaders of the Manhattan Project anticipated a need to release details of their wartime accomplishments, principally as a form of recognition for <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> had labored in secrecy. Press releases were prepared in advance of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and an official account, known as the Smyth Report after its author, the physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth, was commissioned in April 1944 to provide a history of the project for public release. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie Groves, his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman, and Smyth agreed that information could be publicly released if it was essential for an understanding of the project, or was already generally known or deducible, or had no significance to the production of atomic bombs. The first copies went on sale on August 12, 1945.|$|E

25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age.

25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 60 - 64) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of aquatic and land-based exercise on balance and gait outcomes in people post-stroke. Methods: One person (1 male) participated in land-based exercise, two people (1 male and 1 female) participated in aquatic exercise, and one person (1 male) participated in home-based exercise. The aquatic and land-based participants received an 8 -week exercise program, 3 training sessions, 3 times a week for 50 minutes. <b>The</b> home-based exercise <b>participant</b> was provided with an individualized exercise program which had the components similar to the other two protocols. The Biodex Balance Equipment was used to collect <b>the</b> <b>participants???</b> balance data and Biodex Gait Trainer was used to collect <b>the</b> <b>participants???</b> walking data. Pre-data was collected before the beginning of the exercise program followed by bi-weekly data collection. There were a total of five data collection points. The individuals participating in a aquatic exercise program performed the exercise in the therapeutic pool with a pool temperature range from 92 - 94 degrees Fahrenheit. The individual participating in land-based exercise program performed the exercise in the expansion room. Results: The balance time series graph of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>who</b> took part in an 8 -week land-based exercise program revealed a decrease in overall scores, medial-lateral index and anterior-posterior index. The time series graph of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> (1) <b>who</b> took part in an 8 -week aquatic exercise program revealed a decrease in overall score and anterior-posterior index. The balance time series graph of <b>participant</b> (2) <b>who</b> took part in an 8 -week aquatic training programs revealed a decrease in overall scores, anterior-posterior index and medial-lateral index. The balance time series graph of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>who</b> participated in an 8 -week home-based exercise program did not show significant improvement in overall scores, anterior-posterior index or medial-lateral index. The gait time series graph of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> <b>who</b> took part in an 8 -week land-based training program showed significant improvement in coefficient of variation, step length, walking speed and cadence. However, they did not show improvement in ambulation index and the time they spent on each foot. The gait time series graph of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> 1 <b>who</b> took part in an 8 -week aquatic exercise program showed significant improvement in coefficient of variation, step length and walking speed. However, they did not show improvement in ambulation index, cadence or the time they spent on each foot. The gait time series graph of <b>the</b> <b>participant</b> 2 <b>who</b> took part in an 8 -week aquatic exercise program showed significant improvement in ambulation index, the time they spent on each foot coefficient of variation, step length and walking speed. However, they did not show improvement in step length or cadence.

25|$|From 2009 onwards, Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{expanded}} its temporary ordination program {{by making it}} nationwide. In this program, the participants were trained in thousands of temples spread over Thailand, but ordained simultaneously at Wat Phra Dhammakaya. Held {{in cooperation with the}} House of Representatives, the concept of the program was to reverse the trend of the number of monks in Thailand decreasing. The program was held twice a year, and <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> decided to stay in the monkhood were encouraged to revive abandoned temples. In 2010, 10,685 monks joined the program. As part of the ordination programs, Wat Phra Dhammakaya started to organize pilgrimages passing important places in the life of Luang Pu Sodh. This was done through a procession by over a thousand monks through the areas of Central Thailand that were flooded before, while life-size images of Luang Pu Sodh were ceremonially brought to install in pilgrimage places. During the breaks between the walks, the monks spent their time meditating, chanting and making good wishes to those affected by the floods.|$|E
25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than venting sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared venting (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing something that is not related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> had vented were told to draw something related to the film. In study 2, the participants were told to think of a sad event and were put into the venting, distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. In study 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to the sad film significantly improved negative mood compared to the venting condition. In study 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to the sad event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to venting (drawing the sad event) or the sitting condition (sat quietly for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than venting.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Home Office {{issued a}} report on {{research}} examining the level {{and nature of the}} use of khat by Somalis in four English cities; Birmingham, Bristol, London and Sheffield. It found that 38 per cent of the respondents had ever used khat in their lifetime, with 58 per cent of men and only 16 per cent of women reporting having ever used it. 34 per cent of the overall sample indicated that they had chewed khat the month before, with 51 per cent all men in the study and 14 per cent of the women having done so. Some reported family tensions arising from their khat use. 49 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of banning khat, with 35 opposed, but the report suggested that this would not be effective. Three quarters of participants who had used khat reported having suffered health effects, although these were mostly mild in nature, with the most common symptoms respondents associated with khat use being sleeping difficulties, loss of appetite, and an urge to chew more khat. The study concluded that most of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. In January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs also again cited insufficient evidence that the plant caused serious health or societal problems to warrant governmental control.|$|E
