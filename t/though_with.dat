5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy; they can be used, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the closure}} of the {{original}} London tram network in 1952, Holborn provided an interchange between trams and tubes, via the underground Holborn tramway station located a little distance south of the underground railway station. This was the only part of London with an underground tram system, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> no public access.|$|E

5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{camouflage}}, {{also known}} as razzle dazzle (in the U.S.) or dazzle painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I, {{and to a lesser}} extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> a rejected prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other.|$|E
5|$|Fanny {{opened the}} door again and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek, but the splint doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw (often mistakenly {{described}} as a neck brace) prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. He eventually recovered, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> serious scars on his face.|$|E

5|$|In August 1867, the {{commander}} of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of Ordnance, asking how much longer he needed Fort Greble as an ordnance depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts. When it could do so, the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> post-war budget cuts, these were becoming few and far between.|$|E
5|$|New {{music was}} mostly {{recorded}} from Psygnosis's in-house music team, CoLD SToRAGE, for versions released outside the PlayStation. The {{songs of the}} PlayStation, Sega Saturn and the Windows and Mac versions could also be listened to by inserting the CD into a CD player (and skipping the first track). The soundtrack was also released as an audio CD, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> a different artist and track listing.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 19th century, {{there were}} very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the church, for the church, {{stressing}} religious education. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased to be a matter for local option, with the introduction of the Elementary Education Act 1870 a milestone in the British school education system. Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 <b>though</b> <b>with</b> some local discretion such as early leaving in agricultural areas.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{military}} confederation {{with the}} other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of Rome's army {{was provided by the}} Socii, such as the Etruscans, Umbrians, Apulians, Campanians, Samnites, Lucani, Bruttii, and the various southern Greek cities. Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men {{at the beginning of the}} Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in alae, or wings, roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> 900 cavalry instead of 300.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the class}} were loaned to the Great Western Railway between 1942 and 1944 to assist in bolstering freight power, of which there was an acute {{shortage}} on that railway during the Second World War. The class saw use after nationalisation in 1948, <b>though</b> <b>with</b> increasing numbers of Bulleid Pacifics able to take over their duties, the Remembrance class began to be withdrawn from service during the mid-1950s, starting with Hackworth in 1955, and finally Beattie in 1957.

5|$|Smith lost Morrell and Trundle on free transfers, and {{replaced}} them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003–04, although they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a hairline fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup <b>though</b> <b>with</b> a 4–1 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were four}} of the {{thirteen}} colonies in British America, located between the New England Colonies and the Southern Colonies.
