5|$|Soon after Cleveland's {{return to}} office, hard times struck {{the nation with}} the Panic of 1893. A {{businessman}} in Youngstown, Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never kept <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he was signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893. The total owed was over $100,000 and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney. Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher H. H. Kohlsaat, became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property {{in the hands of}} the fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew. He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.|$|E

That was until 1950 when the 500 Club managed to persuade Joe Francis, that the future for his stadium lay in car and motorcycle road racing. The group behind 500 c.c. single-seater racing cars was the 500 Club and it, together with the owners, invested the sum of £17,000 on a tarmac surface.|$|E
25|$|Simple API for XML (SAX) is a lexical, {{event-driven}} API {{in which}} a document is read serially and its contents are reported as callbacks to various methods on a handler object of the user's design. SAX is fast and efficient to implement, but difficult to use for extracting information at random from the XML, since it tends to burden the application author with keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> part of the document is being processed. It is better suited to situations in which certain types of information are always handled the same way, {{no matter where they}} occur in the document.|$|E
25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, {{so as to be}} able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for {{the size}} of the game's worlds. Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described Banjo-Tooie as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that [...] "Keeping <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you can do next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking". Similarly, GamePro remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, Edge concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of Super Mario 64. At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, Banjo-Tooie was awarded Best Platform Game.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need to keep <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's {{going to listen to}} it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put something together, ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

While the calendar's design was criticised, and Mani's early pitches were extremely poor, the team received a large order from one retailer that effectively earned them victory.|$|E
2500|$|As Southern California's {{population}} grew rapidly after World War II, {{there was a}} tremendous demand for church construction.

Judson later recalled, “It got so it almost became counterproductive.

He continued [...] "I'd say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, 'This was a horrible disaster and we're sorry and we're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it'". Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve's position, [...] "Until {{we have the ability}} to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don't really see us moving to that platform". At Sony's E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony's move to make the system more developer friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve's system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market.|$|E
