5|$|Constantine's reforms {{had to do}} {{only with}} the {{civilian}} administration: the military chiefs, who since <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century had risen from the ranks, remained outside the senate, {{in which they were}} included only by Constantine's children.|$|E
5|$|Roman civilization {{began to}} retreat from Swiss {{territory}} when it became a border region again after <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century. Roman control weakened after 401 AD, but did not entirely disappear until the mid-5th century after which the area began to be occupied by Germanic peoples.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3rd {{century was}} not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of}} the Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{defeated}} large armies {{at major}} battles 58 and 57 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made two expeditions into Britain, the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated {{a union of}} Gauls at the Battle of Alesia, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands. Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another rebellion, and, except for <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century, remained loyal to Rome until {{the fall of the}} empire in 476.|$|E
5|$|Constantine was {{the first}} Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, and he played an {{influential}} role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire. He called the First Council of Nicaea in 325, at which the Nicene Creed was adopted by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile field units and garrison soldiers capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Utah War in 1857, Brigham Young {{recalled}} Mormon colonists {{from the}} western areas of the proposed State of Deseret to the core area of Mormon settlement south of the Great Salt Lake. Alexander heeded the call, leaving {{his wife and son}} in Western Utah. With Alexander gone, Bowers and Robert left the abandoned settlement of Franktown for a small mining camp called Johntown in Gold Canyon near present-day Virginia City, Nevada. Bowers opened a boardinghouse and began taking care of the miners. When the threat of war passed, Alexander returned to Western Utah and settled in Johntown, but he did not wish to pursue the life of a Washoe miner. In the fall of 1858 he returned to Salt Lake City where he remained a prominent member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Bowers and Robert remained in Johntown.|$|E

5|$|Emperors of the Antonine and Severan dynasties overall debased the currency, {{particularly}} the denarius, under {{the pressures of}} meeting military payrolls. Sudden inflation {{during the reign of}} Commodus damaged the credit market. In the mid-200s, the supply of specie contracted sharply. Conditions during <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300. Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or fiduciary currency, general economic anxieties came to a head under Aurelian, and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite Diocletian's introduction of the gold solidus and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.|$|E
5|$|In the West, law {{had been}} {{administered}} on a highly localized or tribal basis, and {{private property rights}} {{may have been a}} novelty of the Roman era, particularly among Celtic peoples. Roman law facilitated the acquisition of wealth by a pro-Roman elite who found their new privileges as citizens to be advantageous. The extension of universal citizenship to all free inhabitants of the Empire in 212 required the uniform application of Roman law, replacing the local law codes that had applied to non-citizens. Diocletian's efforts to stabilize the Empire after <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century included two major compilations of law in four years, the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus, to guide provincial administrators in setting consistent legal standards.|$|E
5|$|By the 9th century, <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Classic Maya {{collapse}} was sweeping {{across the}} region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate {{close to the}} city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued {{at the beginning of}} the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being over}} 60 {{years old and}} having {{been out of the}} Army for 25 years, <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union {{compelled}} Greene to seek to rejoin the service. He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist, but he was a firm believer in restoring the Union. He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18, 1862. The regiment of upstate New Yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal. Governor Edwin D. Morgan, although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age, saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political/military problem. During this period, Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment, but Greene chose to serve New York. The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly, gray-haired man reported for duty. They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted, which would have raised many of them in rank themselves.|$|E
5|$|In season three, George's father, Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), is {{diagnosed}} with cancer and dies, with his wife Louise (Debra Monk) and George's brothers Jerry (Greg Pitts) and Ronny (Tim Griffin) by his side. Louise goes on to appear occasionally, and was last seen in season eight. A ferryboat accident brings along Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), who is initially introduced as a pregnant Jane Doe victim, suffering from amnesia. Pope eventually embarks on a relationship with Karev, until she {{is diagnosed}} with a personality disorder in season four, and makes her final departure. Amidst <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ferryboat crash, Meredith falls into the water at the disaster site. Although rescued, she goes into cardiac arrest, waking up in {{what appears to be}} limbo. Within the limbo, Meredith is entertained by deceased acquaintances Duquette and Dylan Young (Kyle Chandler), who was killed during a bomb crisis in the second season, until eventually being resuscitated. Seeking a cure to her depression, Meredith undergoes therapy sessions with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Katharine Wyatt (Amy Madigan), who in addition, serves as a psychiatrist to Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} the chaos of <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated {{as a series of}} generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, Aguinaldo {{suffered}} successive, disastrous {{losses in}} the field, as he retreated northwards. On 13 November 1899, Aguinaldo decided to disperse his army and begin conducting a guerrilla war. General José Alejandrino, one of Luna's remaining aides, stated in his memoirs that if Luna {{had been able to}} finish the planned military camp in the Mountain Province and had shifted to guerrilla warfare earlier as Luna had suggested, Aguinaldo might have avoided having to run for his life in the Cordillera Mountains. For historian Teodoro Agoncillo, however, Luna's death did not directly contribute to the resulting fall of the Republic. In his book, Malolos: <b>The</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic, Agoncillo stated that the loss of Luna showed the existence of a lack of discipline among the regular Filipino soldiers and it was a major weakness that was never remedied {{during the course of the}} war. Also, soldiers connected with Luna were demoralized and as a result eventually surrendered to the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E
5|$|While {{in exile}} in London between 1940 and 1944, Pierlot served as both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and played an {{important}} role in wartime negotiations between the Allied powers, laying the foundation for Belgian post-war reconstruction. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Pierlot returned to Brussels where, against his wishes, he headed a fresh government of national unity until February 1945. Criticism from the political left and the failure of the new government to deal with the serious issues facing the country following the liberation led to the fall of the government in February 1945 and he was replaced by the socialist Achille Van Acker. Pierlot's stance against Leopold III during the war made him a controversial figure during his lifetime and he was widely disliked in the same royalist and conservative circles from which his own Catholic Party (later the Christian Social Party) drew most of its support. He retired from politics in 1946 amid <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Question, surrounding whether Leopold could return to the Belgian throne, and died peacefully in 1963. After his death, Pierlot's reputation improved as the decisions he took during the war were reconsidered by historians.|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{increasing}} trouble and decline {{began with the}} reign of Commodus. Commodus' assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors, of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious. The assassination of Alexander Severus in 235 led to <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty-year time span. It {{was not until the}} reign of Diocletian that the empire was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy, which saw four emperors rule the empire at once. This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful, leading to a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine the Great, who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler of the empire in 324. Constantine subsequently established a second capital city in Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople. It remained the capital of the east until its demise. Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion of the empire. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395, the empire was permanently divided between the West and the East. The dominion of the Western Roman Empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power, civil wars, barbarian migrations and invasions, military reforms and economic depression. The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire's decay, while the deposition of the emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 by Odoacer, is generally accepted to mark the end of the empire in the west. However, Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague, and separate rule in the Western part of the empire only ceased to exist upon the death of Julius Nepos, in 480. The Eastern Roman Empire (in modern historiography called the Byzantine Empire) endured for another millennium as one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch-rival the Sassanid Empire, which had inherited a centuries-old Roman-Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians. It eventually fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.|$|E
