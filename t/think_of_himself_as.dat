5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
25|$|Khaled Abou El Fadl {{claims that}} the verses (88:21–22) {{emphasizes}} that even Muhammad {{does not have the}} right to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a warden who has the power to coerce people. This is reaffirmed by many of the historical reports regarding the Qur'anic revelation that emphasize that belief and conviction cannot be coerced. He further states that moderates consider the verse (2:256) to be enunciating a general, overriding principle that cannot be contradicted by isolated traditions attributed to the Prophet. He concludes that moderates do not believe that there is any punishment that attaches to apostasy.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer {{who likes}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than}} a wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E

25|$|Grant {{took great}} pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local {{reputation}} as a boxer. He always strived {{to live up to}} the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained. While Grant liked to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered. Indeed, at times he was just as likely to burst into tears as he was to throw a punch. Because of this, he attracted many women, despite the fact that he often treated them as possessions, disregarding their feelings and eliciting exaggerated revenge should they cross him (resulting in spousal abuse and the destruction of all three of his marriages). His quick temper was off-set by a period of genuine remorse and promises that he would change. However, more often than not, Grant reverted to form and when placed under pressure he seemed incapable of controlling his aggression, disregarding all consequences.|$|E
25|$|Service members {{requiring}} observation or care {{beyond the}} unit level are evacuated to facilities {{in close proximity}} to, but separate from the medical or surgical patients at the BAS, surgical support company in a central location (Marines) or forward support/division support or area support medical companies (Army) nearest the service members' unit. It is best to send Service members who cannot continue their mission and require more extensive respite to a central facility other than a hospital, unless no other alternative is possible. The Service member must be encouraged to continue to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a war fighter, rather than a patient or a sick person. The chain of command remains {{directly involved in the}} Service member's recovery and return to duty. The CSC team coordinates with the unit's leaders to learn whether the over-stressed individual was a good performer prior to the combat stress reaction, or whether he was always a marginal or problem performer whom the team would rather see replaced than returned. Whenever possible, representatives of the unit, or messages from the unit, tell the casualty that he is needed and wanted back. The CSC team coordinates with the unit leaders, through unit medical personnel or chaplains, any special advice on how to assure quick reintegration when the Service member returns to his unit.|$|E

500|$|By 1952, McGovern {{was coming}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a Democrat. He was captivated by a radio {{broadcast}} of Governor Adlai Stevenson's speech accepting the presidential nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention [...] He immediately dedicated himself to Stevenson's campaign, publishing seven articles in the Mitchell Daily Republic newspaper outlining the historical issues that separated the Democratic Party from the Republicans. The McGoverns named their only son Steven, born immediately after the convention, after his new hero. Although Stevenson lost the election, McGovern remained active in politics, believing that [...] "the engine of progress in our time in America is the Democratic Party". In early 1953, McGovern left a tenure-track position at the university to become executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party, the state chair having recruited him after reading his articles. Democrats in the state were at a low, holding no statewide offices and only 2 of the 110 seats in the state legislature. Friends and political figures had counseled McGovern against making the move, but despite his mild, unassuming manner, McGovern had an ambitious nature and was intent upon starting a political career of his own.|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E
500|$|Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg: The German army Colonel who was {{instrumental}} in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as [...] "very much a humanist", saying, [...] "He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things." [...] Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for , and the actor was enticed by the script's background, the truth of which struck him as a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg's heroism, [...] "I thought of it in terms of what [...] Stauffenberg represents. He was someone who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life.... He recognized what was at stake." [...] Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg's family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort.|$|E

2500|$|The {{influential}} author Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Third Earl of Shaftesbury is also usually {{categorized as}} a deist.

2500|$|Richard [...] "Ricky" [...] Roma: The most {{successful}} salesman in the office. Although Roma seems to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a latter-day cowboy and regards {{his ability to}} make a sale {{as a sign of}} his virility, he admits only to himself that it is all luck. He is ruthless, dishonest and immoral, but succeeds because he has a talent for figuring out a client's weaknesses and crafting a pitch that will exploit those weaknesses. He is a smooth talker and often speaks in grand, poetic soliloquies.|$|E
2500|$|Though Hazlitt {{continued}} to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "metaphysician", {{he began to}} feel comfortable in the role of journalist. His self-esteem received an added boost when he was invited to contribute to the quarterly The Edinburgh Review (his contributions, beginning in early 1815, were frequent and regular for some years), the most distinguished periodical on the Whig side of the political fence (its rival The Quarterly Review occupied the Tory side). Writing for so highly respected a publication was considered a major step up from writing for weekly papers, and Hazlitt was proud of this connection.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas {{notes that}} the {{underlying}} theme {{of some of his}} films, including The Juggler (1953), Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), and Remembrance of Love (1982), was about [...] "a Jew who doesn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> one, and eventually finds his Jewishness." [...] The Juggler was the first Hollywood feature to be filmed in the newly established state of Israel. Douglas recalls that while there, he saw [...] "extreme poverty and food being rationed." [...] But he found it [...] "wonderful, finally, to be in the majority." [...] Its producer, Stanley Kramer, tried to portray [...] "Israel as the Jews' heroic response to Hitler's destruction." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Adams's death, {{writers were}} more free to speculate. In 1983 Rodney Hallworth and Mark Williams {{concluded}} Adams was {{a serial killer}} and probably schizophrenic: [...] "In the opinion of many experts Adams died an unconvicted mass-murderer". Percy Hoskins, writing in 1984, was of the opposite opinion, adamant that Adams was not guilty but merely [...] "naive" [...] and [...] "avaricious". In 1985 Sir Patrick Devlin, the judge, stated that Adams {{may have been a}} [...] "mercenary mercy killer" [...] but, though compassionate, he was at the same time greedy and [...] "prepared to sell death": 'He did not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a murderer but a dispenser of death [...] According to his lights, he had done nothing wrong. There was nothing wrong in a doctor getting a legacy, nor in his bestowing in return [...] a death as happy as heroin could make it.' He also [...] "could be convinced that Dr Adams had helped to end Mrs Hullett's life". In 2000, Surtees, a former colleague of Adams, wrote a more sympathetic account of him as being the victim of a police vendetta.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1897 and 1898, Skagway was a lawless town, {{described}} by {{one member of}} the North-West Mounted Police as [...] "little better than a hell on earth." [...] Fights, prostitutes and liquor were ever-present on Skagway's streets, and con man [...] "Soapy" [...] Smith, who had risen to considerable power, did little to stop it. Smith was a sophisticated swindler who liked to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a kind and generous benefactor to the needy. He was gracious to some, giving money to widows and halting lynchings, while simultaneously operating a ring of thieves who swindled prospectors with cards, dice, and the shell game. His telegraph office charged five dollars to send a message anywhere in the world. Consequently, unknowing prospectors sent news to their families back home without realizing there was no telegraph service to or from Skagway until 1901. Smith also controlled a comprehensive spy network, a private militia called the Skaguay Military Company, the town newspaper, the Deputy U.S. Marshal's office and an array of thieves and con-men who roamed about the town. Smith was shot and killed by Frank Reid and Jesse Murphy on July 8, 1898, in the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf. Smith managed to return fire— some accounts claim the two men fired their weapons simultaneously— and Frank Reid died from his wounds twelve days later. Jesse Murphy is accredited as the man responsible for killing Smith. Smith and Reid are now interred at the Klondike Gold Rush Cemetery, also known as [...] "Skagway's Boot Hill." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in a version of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In the {{beginning}} of the book, Maxwell Kane is a young boy with low self-esteem. He lives with his grandfather, Grim, and grandmother, Gram. Max <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a butthead. People are afraid of him because he looks like his father, Kenneth [...] "Killer" [...] Kane, a convicted murderer. Max sets the stage for the story by reminiscing about his time in daycare, when he had met a boy named Kevin, or Freak, as their classmates called him. Kevin has Morquio syndrome, wears leg braces and uses crutches, and <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a robot and is bullied by many bigger kids due to his short height. However, Max likes Kevin and thinks the crutches and leg braces are neat.|$|R
