5|$|Draught beer's {{environmental}} impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences. A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, {{shows that the}} CO2 emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds). The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer {{is estimated to be}} 2.5 square metres (26 square feet). Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO2 emissions. Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> pre-bottled beer, can reduce the {{environmental impact}} of beer consumption.|$|E
5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E

25|$|Delta Air Lines began leasing AirTran Airways' 717 in 2013 and was to {{eventually}} lease all 88 of the airline's fleet, as Southwest Airlines who purchased AirTran wanted {{to preserve its}} all-Boeing 737 fleet rather than taking upon another class of aircraft. In 2015, Blue1 announced it will sell their 717 fleet to Delta Air Lines and Volotea. For Delta, used Boeing 717 and MD-90s allowed them to retire their DC-9s while also being cheaper <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> brand-new Boeing 737 and Airbus A320s. Unlike other mainline US legacy carriers, Delta has decided that its best path to profitability is a strategy that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{conduct a}} case study by {{applying}} simple technical trading rules on Chinese stock market. The technical trading rules we tested are moving average rules and trading range breakout rules. The stock indices we tested are SSE A (Shanghai A) and SZSE (Shenzhen A) share, these shares are limited to the Chinese domestic traders. Our main trading rule frameworks are mainly from Brock, Lakonishok& Lebaron (1992), which including the most basic technical trading rules and covered various length of period, however we add the 25 days moving average to our frame work. We obtained our data from DataStream; the data are the daily closing prices of two indices we mentioned above. We compared the mean return and Sharpe ratio with buy and hold. We further calculated breakeven transaction costs to test whether the technical trading rules can still add wealth to investors after adjusting the transaction costs. Our results showed that most technical trading rules perform better <b>than</b> <b>buy</b> and hold. VMA perform better than FMA and TRB, short period (25 and 50 days) performed better than longer period. On mean return, our data violated the assumption of parametric statistical test. We performed non-parametric tests, all the trading rules showed statistical significance at 95 % level <b>than</b> <b>buy</b> and hold except FMA (1, 25, 0), all the trading rules resulted higher Sharpe ratio <b>than</b> <b>buy</b> and hold. On transaction costs, 7 trading rules on SSE A are performed poorer <b>than</b> <b>buy</b> and hold, all the other rules provided positive breakeven transaction costs. Across the entire trading rule, both stock markets offered positive break-even transaction costs, 0. 436 % for SSE A and 1. 369 % for SZSE A. and they are both higher than the maximum transaction costs one bears...|$|R
25|$|By the 980s {{the kings}} of Wessex had a {{powerful}} grip on the coinage of the realm. It is reckoned there were about 300 moneyers, and 60 mints, around the country. Every {{five or six years}} the coinage in circulation would cease to be legal tender and new coins were issued. The system controlling the currency around the country was extremely sophisticated; this enabled the king to raise large sums of money if needed. The ability to raise large sums of money was needed after the battle of Maldon, as Æthelred decided that, rather than fight, he would pay ransom to the Danes in a system known as Danegeld. As part of the ransom, a peace treaty was drawn up that was intended to stop the raids. However, rather <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> the Vikings off, payment of Danegeld only encouraged them to come back for more.|$|E

Baltacha {{was diagnosed}} with liver cancer in January 2014. She died from the disease on 4 May 2014 at the age of 30. Several players paid tribute to Baltacha on Twitter including Grand Slam champions Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams, Billie Jean King, Maria Sharapova, Victoria Azarenka, Kim Clijsters, Petra Kvitová, Marion Bartoli, Chris Evert, Sam Stosur and Svetlana Kuznetsova. A host of ATP and WTA tennis players past and present came together on the centre court at the Madrid Open as a mark of respect for Baltacha. Baltacha's funeral took place on 19 May and was attended by Tim Henman, Annabel Croft, Laura Robson, Jo Durie and Judy Murray among others. Mourners were asked to wear bright colours instead of black and to donate to Rally for Bally rather <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> flowers. The money will be split equally between the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, which she set up to help disadvantaged children take up the sport.|$|E
25|$|The 500 {{shares of}} the Shropshire Canal were {{initially}} valued at £150 each, making it worth £75,000. It was making around £4,000 per year, and rather <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> it, the Shropshire Union decided to lease it instead, for an annual sum of £3,125. The agreement began on 1 November 1849. There were serious problems with subsidence, and the manager recommended that the canal should be converted into a railway in January 1855, but although the Shropshire Union board agreed, their recommendation to the LNWR was ignored. In July 1855, a breach of the canal occurred, when it broke through into the Oakengates railway tunnel. The summit level emptied, causing floods in the town. A second breach occurred in September, on a section which had been re-routed over a mine shaft {{to make way for}} the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway, and seven more occurred the following year. The LNWR then obtained an Act of Parliament in 1857, which allowed them to buy the canal for £62,500, and to close it from the Wrockwardine Wood inclined plane to the Windmill inclined plane, and use the bed for a railway. Closure took place on 1 June 1858. Parts of the bed were used for a railway to Coalport, which opened in 1861. The Stirchley tunnel was converted into a cutting as part of this project.|$|E

25|$|Typical {{passage to}} La Petite Chute {{included}} crossing the Atlantic from Rotterdam to New York City, a train trip {{from there to}} Albany, a train or Erie Canal-barge trip across New York state to Buffalo, steamship travel through the Great Lakes and Green Bay {{to the head of}} the Fox River at Green Bay and finally a 30-mile, ox-cart trip to the mission at La Petite Chute. The first group from Rotterdam arrived on May 22, 1848, led by a Franciscan missionary, Fr Adrianus D. Godthard. Father Van den Broek’s group, held up by an ice jam on Lake Michigan, arrived on June 10, 1848. The emigrants discovered not plowed fields and a village but forested land, being somewhat misled by wording of the De Tijd advertisements: the word “acres” was translated as akkers, meaning cultivated land. There was also not enough good land in Father Van den Broek’s holdings for all the emigrants. There was a resort to drawing straws, with the winners naturally picking the best lots. Many of the others - led by Cornelis van de Heij, a farmer from Zeeland, and Father Godthard - left to form the village of Holland (usually referred to locally as “Hollandtown”) rather <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> the remainder of Father Van den Broek’s land. There were other Europeans, mainly French and Irish emigrants, already established at La Petite Chute, now also known by its semi-anglicized name of “Little Chute.” A few Native Americans still lived in the area.|$|E
500|$|In theses 41–47 Luther criticizes indulgences on {{the basis}} that they {{discourage}} works of mercy by those who purchase them. Here he begins to use the phrase, [...] "Christians are to be taught..." [...] to state how he thinks people should be instructed on the value of indulgences. They should be taught that giving to the poor is incomparably more important <b>than</b> <b>buying</b> indulgences, that buying an indulgence rather than giving to the poor invites God's wrath, and that doing good works makes a person better while buying indulgences does not. In theses 48–52 Luther takes the side of the pope, saying that if the pope knew what was being preached in his name he would rather St. Peter's Basilica be burned down than [...] "built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep." [...] Theses 53–55 complain about the restrictions on preaching while the indulgence was being offered.|$|E
