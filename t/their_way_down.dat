5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{advanced}} to Changnyong itself {{during the afternoon}} of September 2, and ROK National Police withdrew from the town. North Koreans were in Changnyong that evening. With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry, Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the Yongsan road {{in an effort to}} re-establish communication. C Company, 72nd Tank Battalion, led its tanks southward. They had to fight <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the road through several roadblocks. Of the three tanks that started, only the lead tank got through to Yongsan. There, it delivered an overlay of Task Force Haynes' positions to Bradley.|$|E

5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off {{on the island of}} Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered {{the bodies of the}} American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers working <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E

Two streetcars are making <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>down</b> {{the middle of the}} street at center. Horse-drawn buggies and wagons line both sides of the street. There is a six-story rectangular building with a flat roof at right. There are awnings protruding from windows on all of the levels. The street is lined with more buildings, but all are considerably smaller than the large one at right. A network of utility lines crosses the street overhead.; Legible signs include, from left to right, [Pas]adena", "Union National Bank", "Merrill", and "China"...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, three Predators {{consisting}} of Scar, Celtic and Chopper arrive and kill all the humans on the surface. They make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the pyramid and arrive {{just as the}} team unwittingly activates the structure. The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Alexa and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving {{his life in the}} process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Alexa and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not wearing his mask.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{movement}} of the 20th Division to Madang was revised {{in the light of}} events in the Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March, and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 was lost in the air, but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March, and the troops made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. It toiled on the road for the next few months, but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea's weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range.|$|E
5|$|By dawn it {{was clear}} that they had succeeded in {{penetrating}} the perimeter through a gap between the Australian platoons, and they began to engage them with machine-guns from a defilade position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00 a fighting patrol was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the spur line they encountered the Chinese positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six Chinese were killed for the loss of one Australian, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O'Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon assaulting the Chinese occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00 they had regained the feature and the Chinese were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the Australians on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night's fighting had cost A Company dearly however, and among the dead were the two New Zealand forward observers. In total they suffered more than 50 casualties‚Äîhalf their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company‚Äîunder Captain Norm Gravener‚Äîheld the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company‚Äîcommanded by Captain Reg Saunders‚Äîwas attacked only once.|$|E

Ladders are similar to {{interval}} training in that they require more structure, but they are different because the faster speed sections vary in time or distance.
