5|$|Prior to broadcast, series creator Shonda Rhimes did {{not release}} much {{information}} about the season premiere. However, it was revealed prior to broadcast {{that there would be}} a time jump in the episode. After it was announced that Dane would be departing shortly after the commencement of the ninth season, Dempsey uploaded a set picture on Twitter of Sloan in bad condition. Due to the unwanted release of spoilers, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) requested that he delete the photo, and it was subsequently removed. The cast and crew of Grey's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw's character. This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room, in which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Robbins alive on the screen. The picture has since been taken down.|$|E

25|$|Malise is {{believed}} to have died in 1271, while in France. His body was brought back to Scotland, and he was buried at Dunblane Cathedral, the religious centre of Strathearn. In 1817, during reconstruction of Dunblane Cathedral, two sarcophagi were discovered with life-size effigies of a warrior and his lady. Since the fourteenth-century chronicler John of Fordun had recorded Dunblane as the burial site of Malise, these were determined to be the tombs of Malise and his countess, though which one is uncertain. It was marked with the date 1271. In addition, Sir Robert Sibbald once mentioned that in the late 17th century, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> in the church which represented the Countess of Strathearn and her children kneeling for a blessing to St. Blane, though its whereabouts today are unknown.|$|E

60|$|The locket fell open in William Wetherell's hand, for the clasp {{had become}} worn with time, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of little Cynthia within: of little Cynthia,--not so little now,--a {{photograph}} taken in Brampton the year before. Wetherell laid it beside the daguerreotype.|$|E
60|$|And {{others were}} {{pictures}} of natural history, representing rhinoceroses and elephants and spotted tigers; {{and above all}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a great whale, {{as big as a}} ship, stuck full of harpoons, and three boats sailing after it {{as fast as they could}} fly.|$|E

60|$|Not at first, but soon, {{little by}} little, the suspicion, wild and {{unreasonable}} as it was, stole into his brain. He drew out his watch with hands that almost balked him by their trembling, {{and opened the}} back case. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> there--a photograph fixed to the inner side.|$|E
60|$|By a {{contrivance}} quite new to me, {{the pictures}} are made to revolve on a pivot, so that by touching a spring they move out from the wall, and {{can be seen in}} different lights. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> over the mantel-piece of a Roman Triumphal Procession, painted by Rubens, which attracted my attention by its rich coloring and spirited representation of animals.|$|E
60|$|The {{reception}} room seemed a mile square, {{because there was}} nothing in it except some rows of books, on unpainted white-pine bookshelves, a cracked marble-top table, a rag rug, a hairless horsehair sofa and two or three chairs. Yes, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> on the wall, a colored crayon drawing of a cluster of pansies. I looked around for the portrait of Andrew Jackson and the pinecone hanging basket but they were not there.|$|E

60|$|In {{respect to}} the {{carriage}} and horses, Vittorio brought him an agreement, filled up from a printed form, which he and Vittorio signed in duplicate. It was as follows. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a carriage and horses {{at the head of}} it. I give you the document in the original French. If you are studying French yourself, you can read it. If not, you must ask some one to translate it for you, if you wish to know what it all means.|$|E
6000|$|But, tenez, as the Comtesse of Z---- would say, I can exactly {{illustrate}} {{the position and}} attitude {{of the two of}} them from a recollection of my childhood. I remember that in one of my nursery books of forty years ago <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> entitled [...] "The Lady in Love With A Swine." [...] A willowy lady in a shimmering gown leaned over the rail of a tessellated pig-sty, in which an impossibly clean hog stood in an attitude of ill-mannered immobility. With the picture was the rhyming legend, ...|$|E
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the earth}} {{on the first page}} of his geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one night during free study he had {{coloured}} the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself.|$|E

60|$|He {{was then}} lying in Jean Marie's best bed, between lavender-scented sheets. On his right a tiny open window afforded {{a glimpse of}} sea and sky, and of many graceful craft gently lolling on the breast of the waves, but on his left, when anon he turned his eyes that way, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> which of a truth was not of this earth, and vaguely, with the childish and foolish fancy of a sick man who hath gazed on the dark portals, he allowed himself to think that all the old tales of his babyhood, about the first glimpse of paradise after death, must indeed be true.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too loud, David," [...] he said. [...] "All {{this part}} of it must be spoken softly--because all {{this part of}} it is beautiful, and kind, and good. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> in the room, of angels and their harps. I wish I had the angels and the harps to help me tell you about it. Fritz there came in with us, and called it a bedroom. I knew better than that; I called it Heaven. You see, I thought of the prison and the {{darkness}} and the cold and the chains and the straw--and I named it Heaven. You two may say what you please; Mistress said I was right." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{room that}} spoke with eloquence of the wealth and {{refinement}} of Montefeltro, from the gilding and ultramarine of the vaulted ceiling with its carved frieze of delicately inlaid woodwork, to the priceless tapestries beneath it. Above a crimson prie-dieu hung a silver crucifix, the exquisite workmanship of the famous Anichino of Ferrara. Yonder stood an inlaid cabinet, surmounted by a crystal mirror and some wonders of Murano glass. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> by Mantegna, some costly cameos and delicate enamels, an abundance of books, a dulcimer which a fair-haired page was examining with inquisitive eyes, and by {{a window on the}} right stood a very handsome harp that Guidobaldo had bought his niece in Venice.|$|E

60|$|Also, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of this prize-dog in the paper, a noble great {{creature}} with a benignant countenance, standing by a table. He {{was placed in}} that way so that one could get a right idea of his great dimensions. You {{could see that he}} was just a shade higher than the table--indeed, a huge fellow for a dog. Then there was a description which went into the details. It gave his enormous weight--150 1/2 pounds, and his length 4 feet 2 inches, from stem to stern-post; and his height--3 feet 1 inch, to the top of his back. The pictures and the figures so impressed me, that I could see the beautiful colossus before me, and I kept on thinking about him for the next two hours; then I reached New York, and he dropped out of my mind.|$|E
6000|$|One day, as the Prince {{was walking}} up and down the great gallery, {{thinking}} how miserable it was to be so ugly, and to be forced to marry an equally frightful Princess, he looked up suddenly and noticed that the painted windows were particularly bright and beautiful, {{and for the sake of}} doing something that would change his sad thoughts he began to examine them attentively. He found that the pictures seemed to be scenes from the life of a man who appeared in every window, and the Prince, fancying that he saw in this man some resemblance to himself, began to be deeply interested. In the first window <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of him in one of the turrets of the tower, farther on he was seeking something in a chink in the wall, in the next picture he was opening an old cabinet with a golden key, and so it went on through numbers of scenes, and presently the Prince noticed that another figure occupied the most important place in each scene, and this time it was a tall handsome young man: poor Prince Curlicue found it a pleasure to look at him, he was so straight and strong. By this time it had grown dark, and the Prince had to go back to his own room, and to amuse himself he took up a quaint old book and began to look at the pictures. But his surprise was great to find that they represented the same scenes as the windows of the gallery, and what was more, that they seemed to be alive. In looking at pictures of musicians he saw their hands move and heard sweet sounds; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a ball, and the Prince could watch the little dancing people come and go. He turned a page, and there was an excellent smell of a savoury dinner, and one of the figures who sat at the feast looked at him and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Ata did not speak, {{but with}} the boy {{followed}} him to the house. The girl who had brought him was by this time sitting on the verandah, and here was lying an old woman, {{with her back to the}} wall, making native cigarettes. Ata pointed to the door. The doctor, wondering irritably why they behaved so strangely, entered, and there found Strickland cleaning his palette. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> on the easel. Strickland, clad only in a <i pareo>, was standing with his back to the door, but he turned round when he heard the sound of boots. He gave the doctor a look of vexation. He was surprised to see him, and resented the intrusion. But the doctor gave a gasp, he was rooted to the floor, and he stared with all his eyes. This was not what he expected. He was seized with horror.|$|E
