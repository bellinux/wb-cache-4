5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from <b>teaching.</b> <b>In</b> response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

Twenty seven pre-service teachers completed a survey and concept maps.

At the beginning of the course participants were concerned if “they would be able to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms”. At the end of the program the majority believed that they were ready to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> inclusive classrooms but they were concerned if they will get necessary support to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> such classrooms. The results of this study have implications both for teacher educators involved in preparing teachers for inclusive classrooms as well as researchers who are interested in using a new approach to evaluate impact of teacher training courses...|$|R

5|$|In 1935 Pei {{boarded a}} boat and sailed to San Francisco, then {{traveled}} by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations.

Pei was more intrigued by modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by {{the high level of}} drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.|$|E
