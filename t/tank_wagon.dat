25|$|There is a {{continuous}} drainage culvert between the tracks to lead ground water {{away to the}} lowest point of the tunnel, under Sudbrook Pumping Station, where it is pumped to the surface. The hazard of ignited petroleum running into the culvert {{in the event of}} derailment of a <b>tank</b> <b>wagon</b> means special arrangements have to be made to prevent occupation of the tunnel by passenger trains while hazardous liquid loads are being worked through. Evacuation arrangements are in place to enable the escape of passengers and staff in the event of serious accident in the tunnel.|$|E

40|$|The article {{proposed}} {{a method to}} evaluate the technical condition of <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> that are operated chemical industry. An algorithm for performing work on {{the evaluation of the}} technical condition of <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> was developed, which allows on the basis of diagnosis and analysis of current condition to justify a further period of operation. The complex of works on testing of the tanks and mathematical models for the implementation of calculations on the strength and reliability of the design were proposed. The article is devoted to solving the problem of the effective exploitation of the working fleet of <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> industries by detecting the presence of residual life and life extension. Opportunities for further exploitation of cars the complex of works on the assessment of technical conditions and the calculation of the stock of the resource in article are proposed. Operational research of the park chemical industries has reduced the shortage of rolling stock for transportation of ammonia. The analysis of the many faults of the chassis and the main elements of the support structure of <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> after 20 years of operation was made. The algorithm of determining the residual life of the specialized <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> operated in an industrial plant is proposed. Scientific novelty defined algorithm and the results obtained is the main justification of operational parameters for <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> carrying liquid ammonia, in accordance with the test load. The methodic for resource conservation of <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> carrying cargo under high pressure was {{proposed a}}t first.

50|$|The {{flat wagon}} carried the Hanover Fire Service's TLF 16 fire appliance; two <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> {{provided}} it with water. So that water would be continuously available, {{the two other}} <b>tank</b> <b>wagons</b> were also filled with water. Once the diesel locomotive had delivered two full <b>tank</b> <b>wagons,</b> it would then return to Uelzen with the empty ones in order to refill them at the water crane there. The deployment of the fire train ended on 16 August 1975. For future incidents the Deutsche Bundesbahn has stationed four water wagons along the railway line from Hanover to Celle.|$|R
