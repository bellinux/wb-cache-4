500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|Courtney Conlogue is a 25 {{year old}} American {{professional}} surfer. In {{an interview with}} ESPN she outlined {{what it takes to}} be a professional surfer. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> perceive surfing as just a lifestyle sport. This will be my sixth year competing professionally on the World Tour, and to be involved in something like this goes to show that we do fine-tune our bodies in order to be as strong as we can when we enter the water. During the offseason, I train three to five days a week, and then I train every day in the water. Depending on the way the swell is -- because our sport is based on Mother Nature -- when the waves are good, I surf probably six hours a day." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the January 29, 2007 {{issue of}} Newsweek, GOP activist Grover Norquist {{described}} how Rove {{showed up at}} a weekly meeting of influential D.C. conservatives early in the month, surprising attendees with his bubbly demeanor after weeks of rumors that he might be headed out. Norquist was quoted as saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> had given him up for dead, but he was good old Karl, upbeat and enthusiastic." [...] At the meeting Rove previewed Bush's final two years in office, saying Social Security reform was likely off the table and that Iraq and the economy would be the biggest issues for 2008. [...] "I don't know anyone who holds him personally responsible for what happened to us in the election", said a GOP national committee member, who declined to be named talking about the inner circle.

2500|$|A [...] "tremendous {{amount of}} research" [...] went into recreating the servants' {{quarters}} at Ealing Studios because Highclere Castle, {{where many of}} the upstairs scenes are filmed, was not adequate for representing the [...] "downstairs" [...] life at the fictional abbey. Researchers visited nearly 40 English country houses to help inform what the kitchen should look like, and production designer Donal Woods said of the kitchen equipment that [...] "Probably about 60 to 70 per cent of the stuff in there is from that period." [...] Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management is an important guide to the food served in the series, but Highclere owner, and author of Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey: The Lost Legacy of Highclere Castle, Lady Carnarvon, states that dinner parties in the era [...] "would have been even more over the top" [...] than those shown. Lady Pamela Hicks agreed, stating that [...] "it is ridiculous to think that a weekend party would consist of only fourteen house guests, it would have consisted of at least 40!" [...] However, Carnavon understood the compromises that must be made for television, and adds, [...] "It’s a fun costume drama. It’s not a social documentary. Because it’s so popular, I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> take it as historical fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Gamasutra, Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford {{revealed}} that though the developers had plans for downloadable content from the beginning, decisions {{on what would}} be included in that content were not made until after the game was released. [...] " [...] didn't work on {{them in any way}} until after the main game was wrapped," [...] stated Wilford. [...] "Once the game was out of our hands, {{we went back to the}} drawing board to design everything from scratch, but we obviously had a lot of half-finished pieces on the cutting room floor that we could leverage." [...] Wilford further explained that due to the way The Maw ends extending past the ending would not be possible. [...] Therefore, plans were made for the downloadable content to be dubbed [...] "Deleted Scenes"; levels that take place inside the story of the main game. Wilford was quick to note that these levels were not simply unlock codes that provided the player with access to things already in the game. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> took it to mean that we intentionally stripped out levels that were 100 percent complete only to sell them as DLC," [...] he said, adding that it was [...] "not the case." ...|$|E

Then they were able to start again when the waters went down, and they were {{naturally}} very grateful to God for their escape." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene of the film, Max Stuart {{appeared}} as himself as an older man, driving along a dirt highway near Alice Springs where he lived at the time, and saying: [...] "Yeah, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> I'm guilty and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> I'm not. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> Elvis is still alive, {{but most of us}} think he's dead and gone." ...|$|R

5000|$|The film is {{deliberately}} vague over Lolita's age. Kubrick commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> had the mental {{picture of a}} nine-year-old, but Lolita was twelve {{and a half in}} the book; Sue Lyon was thirteen." [...] Actually, Lyon was 14 by the time filming started and 15 when it finished. Although passed without cuts, Lolita was rated [...] "X" [...] by the British Board of Film Censors when released in 1962, meaning no one under 16 years of age was permitted to watch.|$|R

Commenting later on homophobia in hockey, Kagan said: I <b>think</b> to <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> it's just a part of the game.

5000|$|I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>people</b> {{are quite}} {{disappointed}} in the new direction - some people on the urban scene can be quite staunch ... It’s amazing how short people’s memories are though. A {{lot of the people}} that I’ve dealt with in media have no recollection of me ... There’s no culture these days in the mainstream really - the idea of discovering an artist, getting all their albums and getting obsessed with them is dying out.

There are problems {{with the use of}} boycott campaigns and other pressure to force sellers to stock a product they <b>think</b> ethically suspect. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> argue that these practices are justifiable: that strategic use of labeling may help embarrass (or encourage) major suppliers into changing their practices.

40|$|The {{failure to}} {{consider}} the future consequences of one's behavior is a major risk factor for aggression. Aggressive people tend to act first, and <b>think</b> later. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> focus on the "here and now" {{rather than on the}} future, a tendency measured by the Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) scale (Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, & Edwards, 1994). Alcohol intoxication is a neuro-biological variable that produces similar effects. Participants in the present experiment completed the CFC scale and then consumed either an alcohol or a placebo beverage. Next, they competed against a same-sex ostensible partner on an interpersonally adversarial competitive task in which the winner could administer electric shocks to the loser (the aggression measure). As expected, aggression was highest in intoxicated persons with low CFC scores. Being unconcerned about the future consequences of one's actions, in conjunction with acute alcohol intoxication, combines in a pernicious manner to increase aggression. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. ...|$|R
