5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she {{does a lot of}} research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|As <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> by, Rumpelstiltskin and Belle {{develop a}} strong bond with each other. After {{a few months}} of living with him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E

An organization of Denizens called Bal Masqué discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo {{and attempt to}} use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal Masqué is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal Masqué, and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which {{will serve as a}} paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, {{and all of the other}} Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself.|$|E

He {{develops}} a rude and narcissistic personality once he discovers {{he has the ability}} to take over another person's body for five seconds, but the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's superhuman ability by possessing them. Yuu is a first-year student at Hoshinoumi Academy, and he is forced to join its student council. Initially a fake honors student and chronic cheater, Yuu is reluctant to use his ability to aide the student council, but as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on, he becomes less narcissistic and much more selfless and caring towards others. Over the course of the story, he becomes a fan of the post-rock band Zhiend and falls in love with Nao.

25|$|The Caeliar {{offer the}} {{remaining}} humans a merging {{of human and}} Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results {{in the creation of}} the first Borg, the name being created due to the fragmented thought of the first drone as he was assimilated (his last thought was that he would not become some cyborg, with his individuality ceasing before he could finish thinking the final word). The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar were–albeit accidentally–involved {{in the creation of the}} Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.|$|E

25|$|Butler {{also uses}} Alice as Dana’s doppelgänger to compare how their {{decisions}} are {{a reflection of}} their environment. According to Missy Dehn Kubitschek, each woman seems to see a reflection of herself in the other; each is the vision {{of what could be}} (could have been) the possible fate of the other given different circumstances. According to Bedore, Butler’s use of repetition blurs the lines between the past and present relationships. As <b>time</b> <b>goes</b> on, Alice and Rufus’ relationship begins to seem more like a miserable married couple while Dana and Kevin become somewhat distant.|$|E
25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers.
