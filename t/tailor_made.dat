25|$|Indian {{pitches and}} attitudes have changed {{considerably}} {{in the past}} few years though. The induction of several newer 'green top' venues (such as the ones at Mohali and at Dharamshala), the emergence of Indian fast bowlers, plus the development of domestic league cricket with international participants in the form of IPL, Ranji Trophy, ICL, have resulted in a greater variety of pitches. Some contemporary pitches provide good support for pace, bounce, and swing, giving visiting teams from countries such as South Africa and Australia the feeling of being at home. Surfaces are often <b>tailor</b> <b>made</b> to be flat tops or excessively batsmen-friendly, for the sake of maximising entertainment value, at the expense of all types of bowlers. But at time the reverse is true especially in the IPL wherein pace heavy teams often come-up with green pace friendly pitches to maximise chances of victory.|$|E

Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products. Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was <b>tailor</b> <b>made</b> to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy.

2500|$|Ian Redpath (21) and Rick McCosker (35) {{upset the}} England plans by adding 52 in 83 {{minutes for the}} first wicket. Geoff Arnold made the ball cut and lift immediately, but Bob Willis {{struggled}} and after six overs Derek Underwood replaced Arnold, who changed ends so as to {{have the advantage of}} the wind behind him. [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] (7/113) was called an umbrella bowler – there in case of a rain-affected wicket – {{and he was able to}} make the ball leap and turn from his first over. The openers managed to survive, and by surviving most of the first session they ensured that the Australian middle order would be able to play on a less lethal wicket. Denness failed to bring on Fred Titmus at the other end until the last over before lunch in conditions <b>tailor</b> <b>made</b> for spin bowling, a decision for which he was greatly criticised though E.W. Swanton thought the damps patches were not on Titmus's length. As it was Underwood had to do all the work, bowling 29 overs compared to 31 by the other five bowlers. He achieved the breakthrough when McCosker clipped a ball to Cowdrey in the slips, then both Chappell brothers, Ian was surprised by a leaping ball and skyed it to Knott, while Greg was lbw to a ball that turned from leg to middle stump while he tried to run a leg-bye. With the last ball before lunch Redpath edged the ball the Greig at silly-point and Australia were 77/4. After lunch Marsh tried to hit Underwood out of the attack, but was taken by Greig at mid-wicket at 84/5 with the Kent bowler having taken all the wickets 5/35. The South Australian sun was now drying out the wicket, which reverted to its normal, placid self in the afternoon. The brilliant Doug Walters hit 55 off 66 balls with 7 fours and a six, adding 80 with Terry Jenner who made his only Test fifty on his home ground. Titmus replaced Underwood just as the pitch was losing its turn and Walters was getting into his stride. The Australian batsmen took 24 runs off two overs and Walters's six was caught one handed in the member's stand. The tired Underwood was brought back as his left arm spin could not be hit so easily and Walters spooned a catch to a surprised Willis at mid-off. The tall Max Walker had yet to fail in the series and hit 41, adding 77 with Jenner until the latter became Underwood's seventh successive wicket when he misjudged the flight and hit over a ball. Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee while Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee walked to keep Walker in until Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go and the umpire agreed. Lillee (26) added 36 with Mallett (23 not out) and hooked Willis for four until the new ball was taken. Willis then spread Lillee's stumps and Arnold those of Thomson and Australia were out for 304, the mystery being why they had not been out in the morning such a poor wicket.|$|E
