25|$|Process indices {{examine how}} {{individuals}} process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly verbal communication) supports the knowledge building and information processing {{that leads to}} SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis) to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and task performance (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in press), time constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text <b>translation</b> <b>software)</b> may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.|$|E

500|$|The {{name has}} also become used in various forms of <b>translation</b> <b>{{software}}.</b> Rosetta Stone is a brand of language-learning software published by Rosetta Stone Ltd., headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, US.

[...] "Rosetta" [...] is an online language translation tool to help localisation of software, developed and maintained by Canonical as part of the Launchpad project. Similarly, Rosetta@home is a distributed computing project for predicting protein structures from amino acid sequences (or translating sequence into structure). The Rosetta Project brings language specialists and native speakers together to develop a meaningful survey and near-permanent archive of 1,500 languages, intended to last from AD 2000 to 12,000. The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft was launched to study the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko in the hope that determining its composition will reveal the origin of the Solar System.|$|E

2500|$|Machine Translation {{is often}} {{considered}} to be unreliable in rendering correct “context-dependent meanings” as well as coherent and grammatically correct sentences (particularly when dealing with languages, such as Arabic and English, with very different sentence structures). [...] Meedan’s software, however, {{appears to be more}} than mere Machine Translation. With a large linguistic corpus and overseen by a staff of over 20 professional translators, Meedan’s translations {{are more likely to be}} accurate in both their grammar and meaning. Moreover, Meedan’s users can edit and improve translations themselves. These improved translations are then stored on the Machine <b>Translation</b> <b>software</b> to be used in the same context in the future. Thus, as more users participate in conversations and help broaden the machine translation’s ‘vocabulary’, so the potential errors of Machine Translation should be reduced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Stakeholders {{typically}} {{speak and}} express software requirements {{in their native}} languages. On the other hand, software engineers typically express software requirements in English to programmers who program using English-like programming languages. <b>Translation</b> of <b>software</b> requirements between the native languages of the stakeholders and English introduces further ambiguities. This calls for a system that simplifies <b>translation</b> of <b>software</b> requirements while minimizing ambiguities. Unfortunately, this problem has been overlooked in the literature. This paper introduces a system designed to facilitate translation of requirements between English and Arabic. The system can also facilitate the analysis of software requirements written in Arabic. This is achieved through enforcing writing software requirements statements using templates. Templates are selected such that they enforce following best practices in writing requirements documents...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of <b>translation</b> memory <b>software,</b> <b>translation</b> companies and freelance translators have been accumulating translated text for various languages and domains.

But while the resulting systems usually perform well in translating domain-specific language, their out-of-domain vocabulary coverage is often insuffi-cient due to the limited size of the translation memories. In this paper, we demonstrate that small in-domain translation memories can be successfully complemented with freely available general-domain parallel corpora such that (a) the number of out-of-vocabulary words (OOV) is reduced while (b) the in-domain terminology is preserved. In our experiments, a German– French and a German–Italian statistical machine translation system geared to marketing texts of the automobile industry has been significantly improved using Europarl and OpenSubtitles data, both in terms of automatic evaluation metrics and human judgement...|$|R
