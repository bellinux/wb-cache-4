60|$|The Paris <b>taximeters</b> are good, and our {{progress}} was rapid. We {{passed through the}} crowded streets, where the women spread themselves out like beautiful butterflies, where the electric lights were deadened by {{the brilliance of the}} moon, where men, bent double over the handles of their bicycles, shot hither and thither with great paper lanterns alight in front of them. We passed into the quieter streets, though even here the wayfarers whom we met were obviously bent on pleasure, up the hill, till at last we pulled up at one of the best-known restaurants in the locality. Here Louis was welcomed as a prince. The manager, with many exclamations and gesticulations, shook hands with him like a long-lost brother. The maitres d'hotel all came crowding up for a word of greeting. A table in {{the best part of the}} room, which was marked reserve, was immediately made ready. Champagne, already in its pail of ice, was by our side almost before we had taken our places.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were 1) to analyze the customer expectations and customer perceptions for each attribute service at <b>taximeter</b> testing installation, Balai Metrologi DKI Jakarta 2) to analyze level of customer satisfaction toward <b>taximeter</b> testing service, and 3) to analyze the attributes which could be increased customer satisfaction in <b>taximeter</b> testing installation. The simple random sampling is used to collected 100 respondents that came to calibrate of <b>taximeter</b> in <b>taximeter</b> testing installation Balai Metrologi DKI Jakarta. Servqual, Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), and Suhardjo diagonal are used to analyze and answer the objectives. The results of the study commonly showed that gap average between expectations-perceptions of the customer do not wide (0. 65). The analysis of Suhardjo diagonal showed that all of attributes let on beneath near diagonal line. It mean that the performance of service is still inefficient. The customer satisfaction level was 84. 07 percent (Gaspersz, 1997) or was – 0. 74 on servqual analysis. The customers feel good enough toward the service at <b>taximeter</b> testing installation on Balai Metrologi DKI Jakarta. However, some attributes at tangible dimension and a attribute at reliability dimension showed a wide gap. Based on Importance-Performance Analysis, those attributes were prime priority categories which means increased them could be improved quality service.

In single-trip segments, passengers contact the taxi directly (kerb/rank/street) or through a dispatcher (pre-booked).

The contract will typically include a simple payment scheme and discounts on the <b>taximeter</b> rates or on fares calculated after criteria other than the <b>taximeter</b> fare.|$|R

50|$|To {{cope with}} the ever-decreasing demand for pocket watches during World War I, Hammarlund {{developed}} new ideas for the manufacturing of typewriters and taxi meters. After financial problems however, the pocket watch production was put down in 1917 (about 8,000 pocket watches was manufactured from 1888 to 1917) and in 1920 the company was liquidated. Instead, a new company, AB Halda Fabriker, took over the manufacturing of typewriters. The successful production of <b>taximeters,</b> took the Fabriks AB Halda taximeter (which is the origin of today's Haldex AB (gearboxes, four-wheel drive, etc.) and Halda Trancometer AB (<b>taximeters))</b> and production was moved to Halmstad.|$|E

The meters and updates are part of an integrated electronic payment and radio dispatch system with other taxi equipment supplied by Cabcharge.|$|E
