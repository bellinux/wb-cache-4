5|$|The {{festival is}} powered by Aggreko who provide over 27 megawatts of power to the site with 250 bio-diesel generators, run on 60,000 litres of waste {{vegetable}} oil (WVO) fuel. The power generated is enough to power the city of Bath and the Pyramid Stage {{is powered by}} 4 generators itself. There is 24km of festoon lighting around the site, also installed by Aggreko. This is run with time clocks so <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> only on when they are needed, contributing to the festival's green requirements.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is a warmer color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E
25|$|Red {{almost always}} denotes an {{emergency}} vehicle if <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> facing forward.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} to incandescent gas, In 1933 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> electrified, and <b>the</b> lighthouse was automated and demanned.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> moved a {{few feet}} south in 1869. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{refurbished}} in 1929. It was turned off during World War II.|$|R
50|$|A {{report from}} 1913 says that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> unwatched and <b>the</b> keeper's house is empty, though officially {{the station was}} only demanned in 1920. According to records, in 1920 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> further {{upgraded}} to acetylene gas carbide lamp, the characteristic was changed to a group flashing and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> automated.|$|R
25|$|To {{help reduce}} water usage when restrooms are closed, some restrooms with timed {{flushing}} use an electric water valve {{connected to the}} restroom light switch. When the building is in active use {{during the day and}} <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> on, the timed flush operates normally. At night when the building is closed, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> turned off and the flushing action stops.|$|E
25|$|The shammash is lit {{together}} with the other Hanukkah lights, instead of being used to light them (which would be impractical, given that <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> traditionally oil lamps rather than candles).|$|E
25|$|Croatian level {{crossings}} (prijelaz u nivou in Croatian) {{are similar to}} Slovenian crossings in that <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> composed of to red lights in a triangle. Many crossings are automatic with barriers and bells.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{complete}} <b>light</b> characteristic <b>is</b> [...] "Gp Oc(3) W 10s 15m 10M". This indicates that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> a group occulting light in which {{a group of three}} eclipses repeat every 10 seconds; <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> white; <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> 15 metres above the chart datum and is visible for 10 nmi km.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second example}} {{can be read}} [...] "If both switch A and switch B <b>are</b> closed, then <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on. Therefore, it is either true that if switch A <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on, or that if switch B <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on." [...] Here, the most likely natural-language {{interpretation}} of the [...] "if ... then ..." [...] statements would be [...] "whenever switch A <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on", and [...] "whenever switch B <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Methinks,' said Esclairmonde, 'that <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> there, even as <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> also before <b>the</b> eyes of {{the true}} knight; {{but it is not}} only there.' ...|$|R
25|$|On special {{occasions}} <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> switched off, {{such as the}} deaths of Winston Churchill in 1965 and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. On 21 June 2007, they were switched off for one hour {{as part of the}} Lights Out London campaign.|$|E
25|$|Broad Street {{is one of}} the borough's central {{streets and}} is known for its lavish Christmas decorations, which appear on the street during the holiday season. The street is closed to traffic for a free concert {{sponsored}} by Holiday Express, after which <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> all lit again. Up to 7,000 people attend the shows annually.|$|E
25|$|Lighting is {{controlled}} by several methods. Photoelectric eyes measure the amount of sun coming into the space and increase or decrease the fluorescent lighting to balance the light levels in the office. Occupancy/motion sensors turn lights on and off in conference spaces and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> programmed to turn off automatically at night and on weekends. These strategies reduce the wattage per square foot to 35% below the baseline of one watt per square foot.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1871. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{one of a}} group of New England lighthouses built to the same plan after an award-winning design by a Vermont architect. Nearly identical <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> constructed at Sabin Point, Rose Island, and Colchester Reef. It was deactivated in 1974, but relighted on July 30, 2006. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> added to <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places as Pomham Rocks Light Station on July 9, 1979. In <b>the</b> 1970s <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> sold to <b>The</b> American Lighthouse Foundation, and is today managed by the Friends of Pomham Rocks Lighthouse.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the energy in <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> also {{decreased}} when {{the wall is}} moving away, because <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> doing work on the wall by radiation pressure. Because <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>is</b> reflected, <b>the</b> pressure is equal to twice the momentum carried by <b>light,</b> which <b>is</b> E/c. <b>The</b> {{rate at which the}} pressure does work on the wall is found by multiplying by the velocity: ...|$|R
25|$|Mawari-butai (revolving stage) {{developed}} in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The kuraten (“darkened revolve”) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> left on for akaten (“lighted revolve”), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Creating {{the design}} of the National Christmas Tree and {{organizing}} the Pageant of Peace is a year-long process. In 1999, the Washington Post reported that General Electric (GE) lighting designers begin sketching plans for the lighting scheme in March. In 2004, they began their design efforts in February. GE changes the design every year. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> manufactured at a GE plant in Cleveland, Ohio, and are tested on a tree at GE's headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut, in mid-October to ensure that the design looks right and nothing is technically wrong with it.|$|E
25|$|After {{this service}} of light, {{a number of}} {{readings}} from the Old Testament are read. These tell the stories of creation, the sacrifice of Isaac, the crossing of the Red Sea, and the foretold coming of the Messiah. This part of the service climaxes with the singing of the Gloria and the Alleluia and the proclamation of the Gospel of the resurrection. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> brought up and the church bells are rung, according to local custom. A sermon may be preached after the gospel.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> {{badly damaged}} during Hurricane Sandy. The {{non-profit}} {{that has taken}} over stewardship of <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> <b>is</b> working with FEMA and private donors to save this national landmark.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{automated}} in 1978, {{which ended}} 68 {{years of service}} by light keepers. In 1985, the Fresnel lens <b>was</b> replaced when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> powered by solar energy.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in 1864 from cast iron, <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first lit on 1 January 1865. <b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> first {{automated}} in 1925 {{and used}} an acetylene burning revolving light. Keepers returned to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in 1947 and it remained manned until 1984 when <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> fully automated. <b>The</b> <b>light's</b> last keeper, Ray Walter, {{remained on the}} island working with his wife Barbara as Department of Conservation rangers until their retirement in 2006.|$|R
25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for getting {{around on the}} dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> mobile.|$|E
25|$|With {{the opening}} of its newest store located in Colonie Plaza in Colonie, New York on June 2, 2009, Price Chopper has made {{investments}} to incorporate various green and energy-saving initiatives throughout the store. Green features include a 400kW United Technologies Corp. natural gas fuel cell which provides {{a significant amount of}} power (60% as quoted by Price Chopper) for the store. Abundant skylighting and an addressable lighting control system from Encelium Technologies both allow the store to dim its lighting when enough daylight is present. Occupancy sensors covering nearly the entire layout of the store including all offices, backrooms, and loading docks ensure <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> automatically switched off or significantly dimmed when vacant for a certain period of time. Even aisle ways and other areas of the main sales floor are dimmed unless that aisle or section is occupied.|$|E
50|$|In 1901, <b>the</b> Front <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> about 360 ft {{southeast}} of the southeastern angle of Fort Moultrie, and <b>the</b> other <b>light</b> <b>was</b> about 190 ft {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> Front <b>light.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> eventually removed at an unknown date.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority deemed <b>the</b> <b>light</b> to <b>be</b> {{unnecessary}} and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> deactivated.|$|R
25|$|The {{site and}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} by <b>the</b> Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island is accessible by boat, but both {{the site and}} <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>are</b> closed to <b>the</b> public.|$|R
25|$|Tom {{suffers a}} serious wound on his cheek, and the camp guards realize {{it will not}} be {{difficult}} to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E
25|$|All manned {{landings}} {{happened during}} the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around {{them so that they}} could not see the relatively faint stars. Likewise, cameras were set for daylight exposure and could not detect the stars. Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> turned off. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were {{in the shadow of the}} Moon.|$|E
25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or two o'clock in the morning, when <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>are</b> usually shut off. If the filmmakers had them shut off at their command, it would have cost them $40–$60,000, so instead Hudlin had the three hug, and the lights were {{eventually}} shut off as usual. When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} with a solar powered lantern which was attached outside the previous lantern room. In early 2003 it was deemed unnecessary and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> shut down.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} in 1923 and {{was converted}} from kerosene to acetylene gas. Electricity {{was introduced in}} 1966 and <b>the</b> <b>light</b> <b>was</b> kept manned for many years despite automation in 1987.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> an {{automobile}} built in Detroit, Michigan by <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Motor Car Company in 1914. <b>The</b> <b>Light</b> <b>was</b> a conventional vehicle with a six-cylinder, 30 hp engine. It {{came as a}} touring model selling for $1,250.|$|R
