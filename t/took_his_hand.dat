25|$|In the Vault of the Dark One, the Darkness enters Hook, {{making him}} {{remember}} {{all of the}} darkest moments of his life, including the time when Rumplestiltskin killed Milah and <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> when Rumplestiltskin took his heart {{as part of a}} (failed) plan to absorb Emma into Merlin's hat, and when Emma became the Dark One. This causes him to scream in agony, before he emerges outside of the Vault from dark energy, as the newest Dark One. Like Emma, he is greeted by a manifestation of Rumplestiltskin, who offers Hook a chance to seek revenge on the living Rumplestiltskin, but Hook is reluctant to take up the challenge, knowing what the manifestation is, and not wanting to give in to the darkness.|$|E

Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and new Secretary General Yuri Andropov met with Zia there. Andropov expressed indignation over Pakistan's support of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union and her satellite state, Soviet Afghanistan. Zia <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and assured him, [...] "General Secretary, believe me, Pakistan wants nothing but very {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union". According to Gromyko, Zia's sincerity convinced them, but Zia's actions didn't live up to his words.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after these}} victories, while Kléber was {{walking in the}} garden of the palace of Alfi bika, he was knifed by Soleyman El-Halaby, a Kurdish Syrian student living in Egypt. The assassin {{appeared}} to be begging from Kléber, but then <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and stabbed him in the heart, stomach, left arm, and right cheek, before running away to hide near the palace. He was soon caught, with the dagger which he had used to kill Kléber, and was later executed. The assassination happened in Cairo on 14 June 1800, coincidentally the same day on which his friend and comrade Desaix fell at Marengo. The assassin's right arm was burned off, and he was impaled in a public square in Cairo and left for several hours to die. Suleiman's skull was shipped to France and used to teach French medical students what the French authorities claimed was the bump of [...] "crime" [...] and [...] "fanaticism".|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child {{apparently}} did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio {{at the age of}} 11, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956, Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife, who was of paternal Sephardi Jewish descent, followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming The Bridge on the River Kwai, and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from Psalm 143, [...] "Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning".|$|E
