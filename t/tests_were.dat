5|$|A {{shortage}} of engines {{was a major}} obstacle to mass production {{and development of the}} IK-3, so <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> conducted with more powerful engines, including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, Rolls-Royce Merlin II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51. The <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> incomplete {{at the time of the}} Axis invasion, and the only prototype to be fitted with a non-production engine was destroyed by factory personnel along with the incomplete production aircraft. Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the design team had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.|$|E
5|$|By 1951, the {{laboratory}} {{had come up}} with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development {{led to the creation of}} a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Data and {{conclusions}} from these <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> published in Informational Intelligence Summary 59, Technical Aviation Intelligence Brief #3, Tactical and Technical Trends #5 (published {{prior to the}} first test flight), and Informational Intelligence Summary 85. These results tend to somewhat understate the Zero's capabilities.|$|E
50|$|While monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{treated the}} same as fuzz testing and the two terms are usually used together, some believe they are different by arguing that monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random actions while fuzz <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random data input. Monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> also different from ad-hoc testing in that ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> performed without planning and documentation and the objective of ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> to divide the system randomly into subparts and check their functionality, {{which is not the}} case in monkey testing.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
5000|$|Confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the <b>tests</b> {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> often done to see if confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> necessary.|$|R
5|$|During the {{reintroduction}} of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and {{ill health}} in pre-release birds {{was due to}} bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the average}} GPA of {{incoming}} students was 3.29 out of 4.0. Average composite scores on standardized college-admissions <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> 28 on the ACT (the 92nd percentile) and 1917 on the SAT (the 90th percentile).|$|E
5|$|In March 1914, Regina Elena was {{involved}} in experiments with wireless telegraphy in Syracuse, Sicily. The <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> conducted by Guglielmo Marconi and were supervised by the Duke of the Abruzzi.|$|E
50|$|The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> finally produced. Trial {{questions}} are included and various {{versions of the}} <b>test</b> <b>are</b> prepared to avoid cheating. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{reliability}} <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{the focus}} in the research of reliability testing at present. The basic concepts of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> introduced. Names of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> sorted. Characteristics of mechanical reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The key issues of mechanical reliability testing and its development are then reviewed. Finally, some possible fields in the research are summarized...|$|R
50|$|A <b>test</b> tube <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{distilled}} water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> added. If the drop dissipates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive, indicating an exudate.|$|R
5|$|Operation Sandstone was {{a series}} of nuclear weapon tests in 1948. It was the third series of American tests, {{following}} Trinity in 1945 and Crossroads in 1946, and preceding Ranger. Like the Crossroads tests, the Sandstone <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> carried out at the Pacific Proving Grounds, although at Enewetak Atoll rather than Bikini Atoll. They differed from Crossroads in that they were conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, with the armed forces having only a supporting role. The purpose of the Sandstone tests was also different: they were primarily tests of new bomb designs rather than of the effects of nuclear weapons. Three <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> carried out in April and May 1948 by Joint Task Force 7, with a work force of 10,366 personnel, of whom 9,890 were military.|$|E
5|$|The ODIs were {{followed}} by five Test matches. The First Test was drawn, and the remaining four <b>Tests</b> <b>were</b> all won convincingly by the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|The {{athlete who}} {{finished}} in second place, Lyudmila Blonska of the Ukraine, {{tested positive for}} a banned substance. Both the A and the B <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> positive, therefore Blonska was stripped of her silver medal, and both British heptathletes moved up a position.|$|E
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for {{comparisons}} of the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed rank <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison of the two groups. Kruskal–Wallis, One way Anova, and Welch <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison {{of more than two}} groups. Spearman’s Rho <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to analyze correlations among the variables.|$|R
50|$|The frontal <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed}} at 64 km/h into an offset deformable barrier. This {{is designed to}} represent an impact with a vehicle of similar mass and structure as the car itself.The side impact <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed at}} 50 km/h, but the side impact pole <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed at 32 km/h. The pedestrian safety <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> performed at 40 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The Mann-Whitney U test / Wilcoxon rank-sum <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as the Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test,</b> {{although}} both <b>are</b> nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann-Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to matched or dependent samples.|$|R
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|About 1,400 random doping <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} during the Games. Two athletes tested {{positive}}; judoka Shokir Muminov on November 19, 2010 and Greco-Roman wrestler Jakhongir Muminov on November 24, 2010, both from Uzbekistan, tested positive for methylhexanamine. On January 24, 2011, the OCA announced another two doping failures, Qatari's Ahmed Dheeb who tested positive for exogenous testosterone metabolites and Palestinian Awajna Abdalnasser who tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone.|$|E
5|$|Begun in 1939, {{plans were}} far enough along that <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed any chance of the B-65's construction.|$|E
50|$|Copy <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> that evaluates {{advertising}} copy and creative executions. In this section, the principal methods of copy <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> briefly discussed.|$|R
30|$|The island {{partition}} {{result is}} not feasible if the DER dispatch test or the power flow <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not passed. Model modification and adjustment strategies {{corresponding to the}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> given in this section. Firstly, the cases that fail the DER dispatch <b>test</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and modification of the constraint set is proposed. Secondly, adjustment strategies based on the power flow <b>test</b> <b>are</b> given.|$|R
50|$|Automated <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{advantageous}} for {{a number}} of reasons: <b>tests</b> may <b>be</b> executed continuously without the need for human intervention, they are easily repeatable, and often faster. Automated <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> useful in situations where the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> to be executed several times, for example as part of regression testing. Automated <b>tests</b> can <b>be</b> disadvantageous when poorly written, leading to incorrect testing or broken tests being carried out.|$|R
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of black men. White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, DNA <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{performed}} on {{a sample of}} 45 men with the surname MacLeod, 47% were found to share a common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage {{was found to be}} the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the study concluded that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
40|$|The multisample {{version of}} the Cucconi rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem is proposed. Even though little known, the Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> of {{interest}} for several reasons. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> compared with some Lepage-type <b>tests.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> slightly {{more powerful than the}} multisample Lepage test. Moreover, its <b>test</b> statistic can <b>be</b> computed analytically whereas several others cannot. A practical application example in experimental nutrition is presented. An R function to perform the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
50|$|In {{time series}} analysis, two {{well-known}} {{versions of a}} portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>are</b> available for <b>testing</b> for autocorrelation in the residuals of a model: it tests whether any {{of a group of}} autocorrelations of the residual time series are different from zero. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> the Ljung-Box <b>test,</b> which <b>is</b> an improved version of the Box-Pierce <b>test,</b> having <b>been</b> devised at essentially the same time; a seemingly trivial simplification (omitted in the improved <b>test)</b> <b>was</b> found to have a deleterious effect. This portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>is</b> useful in working with ARIMA models.|$|R
40|$|The finite sample {{properties}} of recent <b>tests</b> of contagion <b>are</b> investigated using {{a range of}} Monte Carlo experiments. Some variations of these <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> also investigated to correct for size distortions and weak instrument problems. The finite sample {{results show that the}} Forbes-Rigobon and Pesaran-Pick <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> conservative <b>tests,</b> while the Favero-Giavazzi and Bae-Karolyi-Stulz <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> oversized. Two proposed variants of the Forbes and Rigobon <b>test</b> <b>are</b> shown to improve upon the sampling {{properties of}} this test. The change in the correlation <b>test</b> <b>is</b> shown to be a non-monotonic function of the strength of contagion resulting in non-monotonic power functions...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the major tests, {{a large number of}} minor trials were also carried out, from June 1955 and extended through to April 1963. Although the major tests had been carried out with some publicity, the minor <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> carried out in absolute secrecy. These minor tests left a dangerous legacy of radioactive contamination at Maralinga.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1 February that the deaths were {{reported}} to Defra. The farm was sealed off while <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> carried out, on samples taken from the dead birds, at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey. Another 1,500 birds died on 2 February. Then on 3 February 2007 the H5N1 causation was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
50|$|Bartlett's <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{sensitive}} to departures from normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's <b>test</b> may simply <b>be</b> <b>testing</b> for non-normality. Levene's {{test and the}} Brown-Forsythe <b>test</b> <b>are</b> alternatives to the Bartlett <b>test</b> that <b>are</b> less {{sensitive to}} departures from normality.|$|R
50|$|Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> used {{to check}} if any new bugs have been {{introduced}} through previous bug fixes. Regression <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> conducted after every change or update in the software features. This <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> periodic, depending on the length and features of the software.|$|R
40|$|The {{fluorescent}} treponemal antibody-absorption double-staining step-by-step {{procedure and}} proposed reference reagents for the <b>test</b> <b>are</b> described. The <b>test</b> and reagents <b>were</b> evaluated {{in two separate}} laboratories on 265 fresh sera, and <b>test</b> results <b>were</b> compared with the reference {{fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test}} results performed in a third laboratory. The data indicate that the <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> comparable in the areas where the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> recommended for use. Problems with inadequate light filtration occurred, but these could <b>be</b> resolved. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> recommended for use with microscopes equipped with incident illumination...|$|R
