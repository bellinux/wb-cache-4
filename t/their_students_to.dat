5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E
5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> pay for their textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and {{two and a half}} hours per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} how teachers’ trust in <b>their</b> <b>students</b> relates <b>to</b> reading comprehension achievement in socially and ethnically segregated {{elementary schools in}} Flanders (Belgium) by taking into account class composition characteristics. It is examined how student variables, ethnic diversity {{and the proportion of}} non-native students in the class, and teachers’ trust in <b>their</b> <b>students</b> relate <b>to</b> reading comprehension achievement and learning growth. A 3 -level multivariate repeated measures analysis was conducted. At 2 measurement occasions, reading tests and questionnaires were administered to a sample (n = 417) of 7 - and 8 -year-old students in 32 classes. Teachers’ trust in <b>their</b> <b>students</b> was found <b>to</b> be a key factor relating to learning growth in reading comprehension, and mediated the relationship between the level of ethnic diversity in the class and learning growth. Teachers with a higher level of trust in <b>their</b> <b>students</b> seem <b>to</b> foster more learning growth in reading comprehension...|$|R
5|$|University College was the {{founding}} nondenominational college, created in 1853 after {{the university was}} secularized. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, and Wycliffe College, a low church seminary, both encouraged <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> study for non-divinity degrees at University College. In 1885, they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto, and became federated schools in 1890. The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University, a Methodist school in Cobourg, but a financial incentive in 1890 convinced the school to join. Decades {{after the death of}} John Strachan, the Anglican seminary Trinity College entered federation in 1904, followed in 1910 by St. Michael's College, a Roman Catholic college founded by the Basilian Fathers. Among the institutions that had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University, a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton, and Queen's College, a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen's University.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E

Although not designed to recruit for the armed forces, some students go on to win service scholarships.|$|E
25|$|There are {{opportunities}} to play various sports for all ages, and school {{plays an important}} role in community. Kindergarten and lower elementary school students can play in a private sport club that can be joined for a moderate fee. Most martial arts can be started as little as 5 to 6 years old. When a student starts 5th grade, school offers free after-school activities for its students to participate. Middle and high schools also encourage <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> join school sport clubs.|$|E

In 2002, there are about 30 small and big junkshops that collect recyclable materials and 20 schools that require <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> bring recyclable stuff as school project.|$|E
25|$|Many sports popular {{today were}} formalised by British Public schools and {{universities}} in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> think and act {{as part of a}} team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.|$|E

This complies with the minimum requirements of ISO 24801-2 Autonomous diver. Such a qualification allows divers to rent equipment, receive air fills, and dive without supervision to depths typically restricted to 18 meters (60 feet) with an equally qualified buddy in conditions similar to, or easier than those {{in which they were}} trained. Certification agencies advise <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> dive within the scope of their experience and training, and to extend their training to suit the conditions in which they plan to dive.|$|E

25|$|In {{the present}} era of globalization, the {{recognition}} of global interdependence {{on the part of}} the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.|$|E
25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.|$|E
25|$|The Arboretum Trail is {{a walking}} trail winding through {{a wooded area}} {{on the west side}} of the grounds. The trail takes walkers past 60-million-year-old petrified tree stumps from the Amidon, North Dakota area, as well as 75 {{different}} species of trees and shrubs which are all labeled with ground plaques. Various statues and memorials are also on the trail. The trail was created in 1985 in anticipation of the state's centennial and also as an opportunity for state employees and the general public to exercise while learning about various trees and the history of the buildings on the grounds. Many area schools take <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> the trail for nature walks and students in the past have used the various trees for leaf collections. This damaged some of the trees, so signs that forbid leaf picking were posted.|$|E

25|$|All {{universities}} {{suffered from}} lack of resources but some of {{this was due to}} corruption. In 2009/10, AAU staff thought nepotism, patronage and abuse of resources was widespread. They noted that the number of administrators driving expensive cars around campus had increased. Inadequate planning from both government and universities allowed resource abuse to occur. Corruption was encouraged by social recognition for wealth and power rather than academic excellence. Some professors were opening private colleges and advising <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> attend them. Teachers were often absent from class and moonlighting to make up for poor pay. Teachers might award marks based on favoritism or ethnic and religious relationships. In on case, a female student reported an administrator for demanding sexual favors in exchange for passing her grade to the registrar. The administration could change a fail to a pass at the student's request. Corruption and lack of transparency were also observed at MU.|$|E
25|$|Kent State gained {{international}} attention on May 4, 1970, when an Ohio Army National Guard unit fired at students during an anti-war protest on campus, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard {{had been called}} into Kent after several protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of the ROTC building. The main cause of the protests was the United States' invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The shootings caused an immediate closure of the campus with students and faculty given just 60minutes to pack belongings. Around the country, many college campuses canceled classes or closed for fear of similar violent protests. In Kent, schools were closed and the National Guard restricted entry into the city limits, patrolling the area until May 8. With the campus closed, faculty members {{came up with a}} variety of solutions—including holding classes in their homes, at public buildings and places, via telephone, or through the mail—to allow <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> complete the term, which was only a few weeks away at the time.|$|E
25|$|Tàijíquán's martial aspect {{relies on}} {{sensitivity}} to the opponent's movements and centre of gravity dictating appropriate responses. Effectively affecting the opponent's centre of gravity immediately upon contact, is trained as {{the primary goal of}} the martial t‘ai-chi ch‘üan student. The sensitivity needed to capture the centre is acquired over thousands of hours of first yin (slow, repetitive, meditative, low-impact) and then later adding yang (realistic, active, fast, high-impact) martial training through taolu (forms), tuishou (pushing hands), and sanshou (sparring). Tàijíquán trains in three basic ranges: close, medium and long, and then everything in between. Pushes and open-hand strikes are more common than punches, and kicks are usually to the legs and lower torso, never higher than the hip, depending on style. The fingers, fists, palms, sides of the hands, wrists, forearms, elbows, shoulders, back, hips, knees, and feet are commonly used to strike, with strikes to the eyes, throat, heart, groin, and other acupressure points trained by advanced students. Chin na, which are joint traps, locks, and breaks are also used. Most tàijíquán teachers expect <b>their</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> thoroughly learn defensive or neutralizing skills first, and a student will have to demonstrate proficiency with them before offensive skills will be extensively trained.|$|E
