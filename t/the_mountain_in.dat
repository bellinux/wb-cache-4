5|$|A geology party, {{headed by}} Manasseh Cutler, named <b>the</b> <b>{{mountain}}</b> <b>in</b> 1784. The Crawford Path, the oldest mountain hiking {{trail in the}} United States, was laid out in 1819 as a bridle path from Crawford Notch to the summit {{and has been in}} use ever since. Ethan Allen Crawford built a house on the summit in 1821, which lasted until a storm in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who {{resided in}} Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and {{a veteran of}} the Alps, made the first attempt to ascend <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> 1866.

5|$|John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and {{although}} he enjoyed the view, he conceded that it was best appreciated from below.

5000|$|The {{following}} is an excerpt from his treatise, [...] "mountains and waters":The clouds and the vapours of real landscapes {{are not the same}} at the four seasons. In spring they are light and diffused, in summer rich and dense, in autumn scattered and thin, in winter dark and solitary. When such effects can be seen in pictures, the clouds and vapours have an air of life. The mist around <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> is not <b>the</b> same at the four seasons. <b>The</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> spring are light and seductive as if smiling: <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> summer have a blue-green colour which seems to be spread over them; <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> autumn are bright and tidy as if freshly painted; <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>in</b> winter are sad and tranquil as if sleeping.|$|R

5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind <b>the</b> <b>mountain)</b> <b>in</b> which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} mountaineers dressed in Alpine costumes used to climb <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> early years, and eight divers {{between the ages}} 17 and 24 would dive off the waterfall. In the second season, all eight were Canadians who had competed in major diving competitions. Their {{schedule}} was six shows a day on every other day. The dive is 58 feet, and the pool is 13 feet deep in the centre and only 7 feet deep at the edges. At {{the end of the}} dive, they were descending at 40 miles per hour.|$|E
5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> <b>In</b> 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E

5|$|The Italians {{were under}} the {{impression}} that they were facing three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians. The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> <b>In</b> them were eight Italian generals, a catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Saïo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is part of}} a popular hiking area, with the Appalachian Trail crossing the summit and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's eight mountain huts, the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, located on one of the mountain's shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman Ravine, famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 45-degree slopes. The ravine is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> all seasons, due to harsh and rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for the wide variety of conditions which can occur above tree line.|$|E
5|$|The still wines of {{the area}} were highly prized in Paris under the {{designation}} of vins de la rivière and vins de la montagne- wines {{of the river and}} wines of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris. The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of Burgundy wines, despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.|$|E
5|$|In one of {{the worst}} {{disasters}} on <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> over thirty years, six climbers—two guides, and four clients—last heard from on May28, 2014, were presumed dead on May31, 2014, when low-flying search helicopters pinged the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers. Officials concluded that there was no possible chance of survival after the climbers fell 3,300 feet (1,000 m) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route. Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing, though the exact cause of the accident is unknown. The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August7, 2014, during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August19, 2014. The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{by itself}} and {{completely}} {{cut off from}} all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit. At 08:00, nearing the top of Hill 464, it surprised and killed three North Korean soldiers. Soon after, North Korean automatic weapons and small arms fire struck the company. All day G Company maneuvered around the hill but never gained its crest. At mid-afternoon it received radio orders to withdraw that night. The company left six dead on the hill and, carrying its wounded on improvised litters of ponchos and tree branches, it started down the shale slopes of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> rain and darkness. Halfway down, friendly fire injured Captain Herman L. West, the G Company commander. The company scattered but West reassembled it. Cautioning his men to move quietly and not to fire their weapons, West led his men to the eastern base of Hill 464 where he went into a defensive position {{for the rest of}} the night.|$|E
5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>in</b> 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that it was apparent that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E
