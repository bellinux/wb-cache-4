5|$|At {{the time}} of Riedel AGs bankruptcy, three prototypes of an Imme with a 150cc {{parallel}} twin <b>two-stroke</b> engine had been made. Fritz Philipps, {{who had been a}} senior executive at Riedel AG, formed Zweirad-Motoren und -Getriebe GmbH (ZMG) to supply parts and perform repairs on Imme motorcycles. ZMG also set up to manufacture an Imme with a 175cc straight-twin <b>two-stroke</b> engine, but made only 25 before they ended production.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot be legally ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a <b>two-stroke</b> or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of <b>two-stroke</b> engines.|$|E

5|$|All six {{ships were}} {{intended}} to use two sets of Brown, Boveri, & Co. and Wagner turbines or Marine-type turbines built by Germaniawerft and four MAN double-acting 12-cylinder <b>two-stroke</b> diesels. Q and R however, was equipped with an additional four diesels, {{for a total of}} eight. The turbines were powered by four Wagner ultra-high pressure boilers, designed to put out 58 atmospheres of pressure. The propulsion system drove three screws, although four were considered for Q and R. The ships' electrical power was supplied by four generators that produced 2,400kW at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 Masters, Woods {{was up for}} {{disqualification}} over {{claims that}} he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole after his third shot had bounced off of the pin and into the water. After further review, Woods was assessed a <b>two-stroke</b> penalty for the drop and was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, <b>two-stroke</b> engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E

5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted diesel engines, {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's <b>two-stroke</b> diesel engines {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for diesel engines were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel engines. These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{switched}} to Dunlop tires for the 1982 season, as Goodyear {{pulled out of}} motorcycle racing. New competition had arrived as Honda entered their new <b>two-stroke</b> NS500 ridden by defending champion Lucchinelli, former 350cc world champion, Takazumi Katayama and newcomer Freddie Spencer. Roberts won the season-opening round in Argentina on the old square-four Yamaha, but then {{switched to}} the new OW61 YZR500 V4 engined bike. He came in third at the Austrian Grand Prix then, sat out the French Grand Prix at Nogaro as {{he and the other}} top riders boycotted the race over unsafe track conditions. Roberts then won the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama ahead of Sheene, and scored a second place behind Suzuki rider Franco Uncini in the Netherlands. In a portent of things to come, Roberts was leading the Belgian Grand Prix when his Dunlop tires lost their grip and he had to settle for fourth place as Spencer went on to win his first Grand Prix for Honda. Roberts then injured his knee and finger at the British Grand Prix and had to miss the Swedish round, but by then the world championship had been claimed by Uncini with a total of five victories while Roberts fell to fourth place. By the end of the 1982 season, Roberts had won sixteen 500cc Grand Prix races, more than double that of any of his contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, rule {{changes were}} {{introduced}} to facilitate the phasing out of the two-strokes. The rules permitted manufacturers to choose between running <b>two-stroke</b> engines of 500cc or less or four-strokes of 990 cc or less. Manufacturers were also permitted to employ their choice of engine configuration. Despite the significantly increased costs involved in running the new four-stroke machinery, given their extra 490cc capacity advantage, the four-strokes were soon able to dominate their <b>two-stroke</b> rivals. As a result, by 2003 no <b>two-stroke</b> machines remained in the MotoGP field. The 125cc and 250cc classes still consisted exclusively of <b>two-stroke</b> machines.|$|E

50|$|Some triples were <b>two-strokes.</b> The Kawasaki triples were {{produced}} with capacities of 250, 350, 400, 500, and 750 cc in the 1970s, while Suzuki produced 380, 550, and 750 triples (the last being water-cooled). Motobecane made 350 cc and fuel-injected 500 cc triples with 3 into 4 pipes {{in the early}} seventies. Honda produced the water-cooled V-3 <b>two-strokes</b> MVX250 and NS400. There have been various race bike triples such as Kawasaki KR750, Suzuki TR750 transverse 3's, and Proton/Modenas KR3, Honda NS500 V-3s.|$|R
50|$|Diesel <b>two-strokes</b> {{work in a}} {{different}} way to petrol ones and must have some form of forced induction - generally a supercharger - to work at all.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of Electro-Motive Diesel's <b>two-stroke</b> engines, the {{mechanically}} assisted turbocharger is not specifically a twincharger, as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup. Once above notch # 5, the engine uses true turbocharging. This differs from a turbocharger that uses the compressor section of the turbo-compressor only during starting and, as a <b>two-stroke</b> engines cannot naturally aspirate, and, according to SAE definitions, a <b>two-stroke</b> engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally aspirated.|$|E
