25|$|Taking Kenney {{ten years}} to write, The Invention of the Zero {{features}} six long poems: A 'Colloquy of Ancient Men,' 'The Invention of the Zero,' 'The Encantadas,' 'Typhoon,' 'Lucifer,' and 'Epilog: Read Only Memory.' All <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> story, however. Though four are set in World War II, all examine {{the history of the}} universe and its evolution from the Big Bang to the invention of computers {{to the development of the}} atomic bomb. Free verse and with extravagant style, The Invention of the Zero provokes questions about invention and whether or not technology has actually helped humanity or just furthered the disparity between science and different aspects of faith.|$|E

In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> from the other.|$|E

Timmons dismissed {{the idea that he}} was deliberately a composer: [...] "I'm a dilettante as a composer. I have never consciously sat down and tried to write a song." [...] He stated that his method of composing a new song might involve [...] "whistling, playing around with the notes, or at a club. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> musician to play this note, another that note, and we kick it around." [...] One account of the creation of [...] "Moanin'" [...] was given by Golson: Timmons had the opening eight bars, which he often played between tunes, but formed the complete song only after Golson encouraged him to add a bridge.|$|E

Mitford's meetings with him, {{which had become}} increasingly rare because of [...] his many political and social commitments, were now reduced to a single visit a year, supplemented with occasional letters. [...] Mitford mainly concealed her true feelings on this separation, although one acquaintance noted her increasingly [...] "savage" [...] teasing of friends, which was perhaps a safety valve: [...] "If she would only <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> she is unhappy one would do what one could to comfort her". In March 1958 Mitford's father, Lord Redesdale, died. After the cremation, she informed her sister Jessica, [...] "the ashes were done up {{in the sort of}} parcel he used to bring back from London, rich thick brown paper & incredibly neat knots".|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street {{reflected}} the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format consisting of varied segments. Based on research conducted over the 30 {{years since the}} launch of Sesame Street by theorists like Anderson, the producers of Blue's Clues wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but Blue's Clues {{was one of the}} first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected—for up to a half hour—and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional narrative format. As Variety magazine stated, [...] "...The choice for Blue's Clues became to <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page." [...] Every episode of Blue's Clues was structured in this way.|$|E

500|$|New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews {{believed}} the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks—focusing more on enhancing the [...] "imagery of violence"—than real attempts {{to scare the}} audience; he gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of five. Dennis Harvey, from Variety magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities. In contrast, Rossiter Drake of The Examiner applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a [...] "compelling take on the mythology" [...] that managed to be [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] at the same time. In agreement with other critics, Empire magazine's Kim Newman felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film [...] " [...] flat" [...] when it came to delivering suspense or anything [...] "remotely scary"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the [...] "dogged psychiatrist". Ben Walter, of Time Out London, felt Zombie added [...] "surprising realism" [...] to the development of Michael Myers’ psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film’s [...] "suspense and playfulness" [...] with a convincing display of [...] "black-blooded brutality".|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Jerome Cohen {{proposes that}} the story is about racial difference, and [...] "allows William to write obliquely about the Welsh": the green {{children}} are a memory of England's past and the violent conquest of the indigenous Britons by the Anglo-Saxons followed by the Norman invasion. William of Newburgh reluctantly includes {{the story of the}} green children in his account of a largely unified England, which Cohen juxtaposes with Geoffrey of Monmouth's The History of the Kings of Britain, a book that according to William is full of [...] "gushing and untrammeled lying". Geoffrey's history offers accounts of previous kings and kingdoms of various racial identities, whereas William's England is one in which all peoples are either assimilated or pushed to the boundaries. According to Cohen, the green children represent a dual intrusion into William's unified vision of England. On one hand they are a reminder of the racial and cultural differences between Normans and Anglo-Saxons, given the children's claim to have come from St Martin's Land, named after Martin of Tours; the only other time William mentions that saint is in reference to [...] in Hastings, which commemorates the Norman victory in 1066. But the children also embody the earlier inhabitants of the British Isles, the [...] "Welsh (and Irish and Scots) who [...] forcibly anglicized... The Green Children resurface another story that William had been unable to <b>tell,</b> <b>one</b> in which English paninsular dominion becomes a troubled assumption rather than a foregone conclusion." [...] The boy in particular, who dies rather than become assimilated, represents [...] "an adjacent world that cannot be annexed... an otherness that will perish to endure".|$|E

2500|$|Another observer, Salman Ali, {{found that}} many of the sukuk {{structures}} [...] "do not conform to the Shariah". According to Ali, while most of the sukuk make an effort to remain [...] "within Shariah bounds", they [...] "replicate conventional debt instruments". They often combine more than one contract, [...] "which individually may be Shariah-compliant" [...] but when combined [...] "may defeat the objective of the shariah". Furthermore, the sukuk rate of return is often [...] "tied" [...] to the Libor (London interbank offered rate) or Euribor (euro interbank offered rate) interest rate [...] "rather than to the underlying business" [...] that the sukuk is financing. This makes the sukuk [...] "so similar to conventional debt instruments {{that it is difficult to}} <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> from the other". Ali believes this may be why rating agencies such as Standard & Poors and Moody's apply the same methodology for rating sukuk as for conventional debt instruments.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tradition}} of giving thanks to God is continued today in many forms, {{most notably the}} attendance of religious services, {{as well as the}} saying of a mealtime prayer before Thanksgiving dinner. Many houses of worship offer worship services and events on Thanksgiving themes the weekend before, the day of, or the weekend after Thanksgiving. At home, it is a holiday tradition in many families to begin the Thanksgiving dinner by saying grace (a prayer before or after a meal). The custom is portrayed in the photograph [...] "Family Holding Hands and Praying Before a Thanksgiving Meal". Before praying, it is a common practice at the dining table for [...] "each person [...] <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> specific reason they're thankful to God that year." [...] While grace is said, many families hold hands until the prayer concludes, often indicated with an [...] "Amen". Traditionally, grace was led by the hostess or host, though in later times it is usual for others to contribute.|$|E

Ever since she was born, Yasuna has had a unique affliction which makes her {{incapable}} of seeing males, and instead to her males are covered in a gray, hazy blur, which makes it extremely difficult for her to <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> male apart from another except through the sound of their voice. Due to this, she was never able to get along well with others; on top {{of not being able to}} see the boys in her class at school, the girls who would normally interact with them were different compared to Yasuna, which built up a divide between her and everyone else. She ended up staying alone for years, and she thought she did not mind it; she did not intend to befriend anyone anyway. However, when she stumbled across Hazumu one day in her first year of high school, she was shocked to find that she could see most of him clearly, though his face was still a blur. From that point on, Yasuna wanted to learn more about Hazumu and gradually fell in love with him. However, even when Hazumu confessed his love to her in their second year of high school, she rejected him since he was still a boy, and she was afraid that he too would one day disappear from her vision. After Hazumu's transformation into a girl, Yasuna wastes no time trying to rectify her mistake and confesses her love to Hazumu finally, but Hazumu is very confused by this and does not know what to do, especially since her physical change.|$|E
2500|$|Frames has {{received}} positive reviews. Luke Bryan of the Chicago Sun-Times extolled the album, suggesting {{that those who}} had previously been detractors of DeWyze {{would have to take}} notice as [...] "gorgeous lyrics <b>tell</b> <b>one</b> soulful story after another." [...] Jeff Dodge of BuddyTV concurred that the album was likely to win over new fans and wrote, [...] "It doesn't have the safe pop-y sounds of his debut; he's now with a record label that supports his musical efforts and he's able to showcase who he is as an artist." [...] People Magazine gave the album three stars out of four and called it [...] "a strong folk-pop effort." [...] Gerry Galipault of The Sarasota Herald-Tribune gave the album a B+, writing that DeWyze is [...] "more confident, lyrically and vocally." [...] In her review for the Daily Reporter, Kate Padilla noted a maturity in DeWyze's voice that she did not feel had been present in his previous recordings. While specifically mentioning [...] "Like I Do", [...] "Frames", and [...] "Silver Lining" [...] as some of the album's standout tracks, she also wrote that she had already listened to the album as a whole [...] "Too many times to count" [...] since it had been released a week earlier. Lamenting the album's low debut on the Billboard Album 200 Chart, Mark Franklin of The York Dispatchs blog, Idol Chatter, wrote that [...] "three of the first four songs on Frames are probably better than anything on [...] Live It Up". Joseph Brownell of David Atlanta wrote that the album contains [...] "DeWyze's most personal tracks to date" [...] and lives up to the expectations that his previous album had failed to meet, while freelance music journalist Kevin Oliver wrote on his blog that Frames [...] "may just be the most surprisingly good album ever from a past [...] winner". [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album three stars out of five, feeling that DeWyze had drawn inspiration from Mumford & Sons and The Lumineers to reinvent himself on many of the tracks. He wrote that DeWyze [...] "eagerly throws himself into the fray, roaring these songs like a true believer", but felt that the album's highlights were actually the pop songs [...] "You Don't Know Me" [...] and [...] "The Ride". In a review for Broken Records Magazine, Cindy Athanaseas called the album [...] "a brilliant piece of work" [...] by [...] "an artist whose music needs to be heard." [...] She praised DeWyze's voice, which she noted ranges from [...] "soft & tender" [...] to [...] "rough & sultry" [...] and wrote, [...] "Each song tells an individual story, but the collection of songs paints a beautiful picture of life’s highs and lows...As I listened to the album, each song became my favorite … until I heard the next one." ...|$|E
