5|$|At the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of {{the delegates}} were {{selected}} by state party conventions, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. When {{the time came to}} select a vice presidential nominee, the bosses also made and announced <b>their</b> <b>decision</b> on whom they wanted – Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm <b>their</b> <b>decision.</b> A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, having read Have Faith in Massachusetts, proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, {{the city}} council changed <b>their</b> <b>decision</b> to close down the tramway. The main reason was the 1973 oil crisis, which had made it cheaper to run hydroelectric-powered trams than {{diesel-powered}} buses. After no investment on the tramway for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used M-23 units from the Gothenburg Tramway in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five SL79 articulated trams were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990. Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{decisions}} of the constitutional jurisdictions may sometime disturb the balance of the normative system.
