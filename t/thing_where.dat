McCrea himself cites Hank Williams, Tom Zé, the Golden Gate Quartet and Sly and the Family Stone as particular influences. The band is most often noted for three things: the prominence of DiFiore's trumpet lines, McCrea's ironic, sarcastic lyrics, and his [...] "droll, deadpan...monotone" [...] vocals. DiFiore's trumpet work originated with McCrea's desire for a second melodic instrument to go with a song he had written; [...] "A lead guitar playing those lines would have been really hokey. I like it when it's a contrapuntal <b>thing,</b> <b>where</b> the guitar is doing one melody, the vocal is doing another melody, and the trumpet plays this third melody.
