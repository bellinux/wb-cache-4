5|$|According to {{a recent}} survey, the ONA has more female {{supporters}} <b>than</b> <b>either</b> the Church of Satan or the Temple of Set; more women with children; more older supporters; more supporters who are better established in socio-economic terms; and more who politically are further to the Right.|$|E
50|$|Other {{possible}} orbital interactions include libration and co-orbital configuration. The Saturnian moons Janus and Epimetheus {{share their}} orbits, {{the difference in}} semi-major axes being less <b>than</b> <b>either's</b> mean diameter. Libration is a perceived oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other. The Earth-moon satellite system is known to produce this effect.|$|R

5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger <b>than</b> <b>either</b> parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics <b>than</b> <b>either</b> of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst <b>than</b> <b>either</b> rhenium or palladium. However, its radioactivity is a major problem in safe catalytic applications.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} league's history, {{the team}} {{at the top of}} the standings during the first half of the season faced the team that won the latter half of the season for the championship; in 1960 if a third team had a better {{cumulative}} record <b>than</b> <b>either</b> champion, that team played the champion of the latter half of the season to face the champion of the first half for the league championship.|$|E

In the general election Wolf defeated Republican real estate developer James H. Crocker Jr. In his 2012 bid for re-election Wolf faced no competition in either a primary or general election. In 2014 Wolf was re-elected to his third term, defeating Republican Ron Beaty in the general election.|$|E
5|$|IRIS {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} cast split between characters of North Korean and South Korean descent. Because the series explores {{the tension and}} mentality behind {{the two sides of}} the conflict, both the North and South perspectives are shown at length. The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile their differences to fight an evil greater <b>than</b> <b>either</b> side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances are stressed and put to the test.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, paleontologists Simon R. Harris, David J. Gower, and Mark Wilkinson {{examined}} previous phylogenetic {{studies of}} aetosaurs and criticized {{the way in}} which they used certain characters to produce cladograms. They concluded that only three hypotheses of aetosaur relationships from previous studies were still true: that Aetosaurus is the most basal aetosaur, that Aetosauroides is the sister taxon of Stagonolepis robertsoni, and that Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus are more closely related to each other <b>than</b> <b>either</b> is to Neoaetosauroides. They also went on to correct the trees from all previous analyses.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was sworn}} into the Senate on November 7, 1962. He {{maintained}} a deferential {{attitude towards the}} older, seniority-laden Southern members when he first entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues.

5|$|One {{year after}} the death of the Joker during the events of , Batman is {{struggling}} {{to come to terms with}} the absence of his nemesis and the uncomfortable feeling that the pair shared a bond deeper <b>than</b> <b>either</b> could admit. Without the Joker's chaotic presence, Gotham's citizens have never felt safer, and crime in the city has dramatically declined. However, this gives Batman's enemies, including Penguin, Two-Face, and Harley Quinn, a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman.|$|E
5|$|The harbour from Church Point, {{where the}} two arms meet, to the Atlantic Ocean is {{referred}} to as Sheet Harbour. It is wider <b>than</b> <b>either</b> arm. It is approximately 11-15 metres (36-49 ft) deep at low tide. It gradually widens as it flows southward the Atlantic Ocean. After Church Point, it flows southeast-ward past the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port and west of the small community of Watt Section. It then curves and flows southwest-ward to southward toward the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban society <b>than</b> <b>either</b> the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire.

There were 179 direct grant grammar schools, which, together with over 1,200 grammar schools maintained by local authorities, formed the most academic tier of the Tripartite System. They varied greatly in size and composition, but, on average, achieved higher academic results <b>than</b> <b>either</b> maintained grammar schools or independent schools.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder <b>than</b> <b>either</b> of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
