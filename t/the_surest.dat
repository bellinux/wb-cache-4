5|$|Forster's main interest, however, {{was again}} {{focused on the}} social {{behavior}} of people, as 15 years earlier in the Pacific. The national uprisings in Flanders and Brabant and the revolution in France sparked his curiosity. The journey through these regions, together with the Netherlands and England, where citizens' freedoms were equally well developed, in the end helped him to resolve his own political opinions. From that time on {{he was to be}} a confident opponent of the ancien régime. With other German scholars, he welcomed the outbreak of the revolution as a clear consequence of the Enlightenment. As early as July 30, 1789, shortly after he heard about the Storming of the Bastille, he wrote to his father-in-law, philologist Christian Gottlob Heyne, that it was beautiful to see what philosophy had nurtured in people's minds and then had realized in the state. To educate people about their rights in this way, he wrote, was after all <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> way; the rest would then result as if by itself.|$|E
25|$|Simple hedonism is {{the view}} that {{physical}} pleasure is the ultimate good.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sure</b> Thing was {{released}} on DVD August 5, 2003 as a Special Edition. The release was a single disc, but was presented as a DVD-14 (a dual-sided disc with one side dual-layered and the other single-layered). The dual-layered side contains both widescreen and standard formats of the film along with digitally enhanced 5.1 surround sound or original mono in both French and English, audio commentary by Reiner, and a trivia track. The single-layered side contains a 26-minute featurette titled The Road To <b>The</b> <b>Sure</b> Thing with interviews of Rob Reiner, John Cusack, Daphne Zuniga, Nicollette Sheridan, writers Steven L. Bloom and Jonathan Roberts, and producer Roger Birnbaum. Also included are three mini-featurettes (Dressing <b>The</b> <b>Sure</b> Thing, Casting <b>The</b> <b>Sure</b> Thing, and Reading <b>The</b> <b>Sure</b> Thing) and <b>the</b> theatrical trailer.|$|R

25|$|Another {{area which}} he {{explored}} was {{the relationship between}} ionic bonding, where electrons are transferred between atoms, and covalent bonding, where electrons are shared between atoms on an equal basis. Pauling showed that these were merely extremes, and that for most actual cases of bonding, the quantum-mechanical wave function for a polar molecule AB {{is a combination of}} wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules. Here Pauling's electronegativity concept is particularly useful; the electronegativity difference between a pair of atoms will be <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> predictor of the degree of ionicity of the bond.|$|E
25|$|A {{principal}} {{source for}} the items in Illich-Svitych's dictionary was the earlier work of Alfredo Trombetti (1866–1929), an Italian linguist who had developed a classification scheme for all the world's languages, widely reviled {{at the time and}} subsequently ignored by almost all linguists. In Trombetti's time, a widely held view on classifying languages was that similarity in inflections is <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> proof of genetic relationship. In the interim, the view had taken hold that the comparative method—previously used as a means of studying languages already known to be related and without any thought of classification—is the most effective means to establish genetic relationship, eventually hardening into the conviction that it is the only legitimate means to do so. This view was basic to the outlook of the new Nostraticists. Although Illich-Svitych adopted many of Trombetti's etymologies, he sought to validate them by a systematic comparison of the sound systems of the languages concerned.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 18th century, Guria faced an {{increasing}} {{political and economic}} downfall due to the Ottoman encroachments as well as repeated occasions of civil strife. Attempts by the Gurian princes to enter into alliances with other Georgian rulers and Russia resulted {{in a series of}} Turkish punitive raids. By 1723, the Gurieli had lost Batumi and Chakvi to the Ottomans and the whole coastline of Guria had been garrisoned by the Turks. The Gurian support to the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) caused a severe reaction from the Ottoman government. Kobuleti and the surrounding area were detached from Guria and subjected to Islamization, an apostasy being <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> way to escape slavery. The rest of Christian population had to move to safer regions of Georgia. This, combined with extensive slave trade and Turkish inroads, resulted in a virtual depopulation of several areas of Guria towards the late 18th century. The population of Guria was estimated by Güldenstädt at 5,000, and by Reineggs at 6,000 families in the 1770s.|$|E
50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{found that people}} prefer <b>the</b> <b>sure</b> option when <b>the</b> options are framed as gains (program A) and the risky option when they are framed as losses (program D), {{despite the fact that}} the expected values for all the programs are equivalent. This is in contrast to a normative point of view that would indicate that if respondents prefer <b>the</b> <b>sure</b> option in <b>the</b> positive frame, they should also prefer <b>the</b> <b>sure</b> option in <b>the</b> negative frame.|$|R
30|$|In <b>the</b> sequel, <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> SigShrink {{parameters}} (attenuation {{degree and}} threshold) are those obtained by performing <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> optimization on <b>the</b> {{whole set of}} the detail DWT coefficients. The attenuation degree and threshold thus computed are then applied at every decomposition level to the detail DWT coefficients. We also introduce <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> Level-Dependent SigShrink (SURE LD-SigShrink) parameters. These parameters are obtained by applying an SURE optimization at every detail (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) subimage located at the different resolution levels concerned (4 resolution levels in our experiments).|$|R
40|$|SURE (Science User Resource Expert) is one {{of three}} {{components}} that compose the SURPASS (Science User Resource Planning and Scheduling System). This system is a planning and scheduling tool which supports distributed planning and scheduling, based on resource allocation and optimization. Currently SURE is being used within the SURPASS by the UARS (Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite) SOLSTICE instrument to build a daily science plan and activity schedule and in a prototyping effort with NASA GSFC to demonstrate distributed planning and scheduling for the SOLSTICE II instrument on the EOS platform. For the SOLSTICE application <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> utilizes a rule-based system. Development of a rule-based program using Ada CLIPS as opposed to using conventional programming, allows for capture of the science planning and scheduling heuristics in rules and provides flexibility in inserting or removing rules as the scientific objectives and mission constraints change. <b>The</b> <b>SURE</b> system's role as a component in the SURPASS, the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> planning and scheduling tool, <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> knowledge base, and the software architecture of <b>the</b> <b>SURE</b> component are described...|$|R

500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>surest</b> signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E
