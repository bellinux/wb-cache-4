5|$|Merrick was {{becoming}} a greater financial burden on his family and eventually, his father secured him a hawker's licence which enabled him to earn money selling items from the haberdashery shop, door to door. This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.|$|E
5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who dared not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first to the ball but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E

5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could do no more than fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E

25|$|In the 7th century, {{probably}} {{in the early years}} of Islam while writing down the Qur'an, scribes realized that working out which of the ambiguous letters a particular letter was from context was laborious and not always possible, so a proper remedy was required. Writings in the Nabataean and Syriac alphabets already had sporadic examples of dots being used to distinguish letters which had become identical, for example as in the table on the right. By analogy with this, a system of dots was added to the Arabic alphabet <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> different letters for Classical Arabic's 28 phonemes.

His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father's affairs, however, went from bad to worse. He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> income from farming to pay rents to his landlord, Lord Northwick. In 1834, he fled to Belgium to avoid arrest for debt. The whole family moved to a house near Bruges, where they lived entirely on Frances's earnings.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{investigation}} of production records at Norsk Hydro {{and analysis of}} an intact barrel that was salvaged in 2004 revealed that although the barrels in this shipment contained water of pH14—indicative of the alkaline electrolytic refinement process—they did not contain high concentrations of D2O.

25|$|Walter {{embraced the}} idea of making their {{fortunes}} in the New World. With him as their musical director, impresario, and chaperone, the three older sisters – including Rosalind, then – arrived in New York at Christmas 1911, with enough money for three weeks in a hotel. They would have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> money by singing to pay for their return ticket. They were an instant success; within six months they were invited to sing at the White House, but left for home before they could fit the President into their busy schedule. At this point, the eldest sister (who had studied the harp and singing at the Royal College of Music) got married and was replaced by the youngest. As The Fuller Sisters they continued making immensely successful tours, with Rosalind their most bewitching performer. President Woodrow Wilson invited them to sing for him on two occasions, once at the White House and once at his summer residence. Their career ended when the entry of the US into World War I wiped out the demand for folksongs.|$|E
25|$|Speculation that Sheringham {{would leave}} United {{increased}} {{just after the}} 1998–99 season got underway, when Dwight Yorke moved to Old Trafford from Aston Villa. Yorke immediately formed a prolific partnership with Cole as United went on to regain the league title {{on the final day}} of the season. Sheringham's first-team chances were relatively limited but he still managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> appearances to qualify for a championship medal at the end of the season– at the age of 33 he had won his first major trophy. A week later he came off the substitutes bench to score United's opening goal in a 2–0 defeat of Newcastle United the FA Cup final to secure the double. Four days after the FA Cup triumph, Sheringham scored a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, having come on as a substitute earlier in the game. With seconds of stoppage-time remaining, Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored from Sheringham's headed flick-on, and United won a treble of the Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup with Sheringham– having not won a major honour in his 15-year career on leaving Spurs– now having won every top-level trophy in the English game.|$|E

When Bruce was unable to {{guarantee}} him a regular place in the team, Horsfield moved on to Wigan Athletic, signing a three-year contract in September 2003. A transfer fee of £500,000 was agreed, though this could have risen to £1million if the player had gone on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> appearances for Wigan. Horsfield said of the move, [...] "I could easily have sat out the last two years of my contract at Birmingham, but that's not my style– I just want to play football."

The Admiralty Shipyard was {{not yet ready to}} build such a large ship and {{required}} additional preparations before it was ready to begin Ekaterina II. Some delays were caused by the necessity to send some equipment from St. Petersburg, but the primary reason for the lengthy six-year construction time were near-constant design changes after building had begun. The gun mountings were found to be larger than anticipated and the redoubt had to be carried out over the ship's sides on sponsons <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> room.

500|$|Colt {{knew he had}} to {{make his}} revolvers affordable, as the death of many great inventions was a high retail price. Colt fixed his prices at a level below his {{competition}} to maximize sales volume. From his experience in haggling with government officials, he knew what numbers he would have to generate <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>enough</b> profit to invest money in improving his machinery, thereby limiting imitators' ability to produce a comparable weapon at a lower price. Although successful at this, for the most part, his preoccupation with marketing strategies and patent protection caused him to miss a great opportunity in firearms development when he dismissed an idea from one of his gunsmiths, Rollin White. White had an idea of a [...] "bored-through" [...] revolver cylinder to allow the use of metallic cartridges in a handgun. After Colt fired White for suggesting an improvement to his revolver, White took his idea to Colt's competitor, Smith & Wesson, who patented his invention and kept Colt from being able to build cartridge firearms for almost 20 years.|$|E

50|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> antihydrogen cold <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{be trapped}} the ALPHA {{collaboration}} has implemented a novel technique, well known from atomic physics, called evaporative cooling.

As no readily available techniques exist to cool antihydrogen, the constituents must be cold and kept cold for the formation. Antiprotons and positrons are not easily cooled to cryogenic temperatures and the implementation of evaporative cooling is thus an important step towards antihydrogen trapping.|$|R
