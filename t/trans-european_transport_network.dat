30|$|However, the {{difficulty}} in capital mobilization, due to the economic crisis, regarding port development, leads to more calls for supranational (EU) funding [8].

30|$|The {{promotion}} of these development priorities {{in the framework}} of the EU Transport Policy and especially through the opportunity presented by the functioning of marine highways which are developed under the <b>Trans-European</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Networks</b> in the last years, are considered very important {{for the future of the}} Greek economy.|$|R
