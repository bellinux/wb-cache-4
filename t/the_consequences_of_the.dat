5|$|The 2005 series {{constitutes}} a loose story arc, dealing with <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Time War and the mysterious Bad Wolf.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicxulub impact were {{of global}} extent. Some of these {{phenomena}} were brief occurrences that immediately followed the impact, {{but there were}} also long-term geochemical and climatic disruptions that were catastrophic to the ecology.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of the entertainment industry has been {{the creation of new}} types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} lemma is <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morse inequality, {{which is}} sufficient for proving Theorem  1.1.|$|R
50|$|Includes XII chapters, 147 articles. <b>The</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policy <b>of</b> {{economic}} liberalization “Doi Moi” started in 1986.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{mechanism}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive symptoms {{appears to}} be <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irritation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive tract by local inflammatory phenomena.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among}} those who were {{dismissed}} from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|Turkish unease about Poland's {{influence}} in Russia, <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lisowczycy expedition against Transylvania, an Ottoman fief in 1619 and {{the burning of}} Varna by the Cossacks in 1620 caused the Empire under the young Sultan Osman II to declare a war against the Commonwealth, {{with the aim of}} breaking and conquering the Polish–Lithuanian state.|$|E
5|$|Anton was a {{scientist}} in Nazi Germany who, following a disagreement regarding {{the direction of}} its nuclear program, is recruited by the US and flees via France, Spain, and Portugal. He becomes {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project, witnesses the tests, and travels to Hiroshima recording the aftermath. Anton regrets <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his belief that it was necessary to end the war and prevented more deaths. He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E

2500|$|Article 33 {{states that}} {{resisting}} tyranny {{is a logical}} <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> man: [...] "Resistance to oppression is <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other rights <b>of</b> man".|$|R

5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, serious {{concerns}} were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, analysis was claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some about <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E
5|$|Civilians {{who took}} part in the {{evacuation}} suffered <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians who followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E
50|$|A {{by-election}} {{was held}} in the Nukufetau constituency in Tuvalu as <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition member <b>of</b> parliament Faimalaga Luka as <b>the</b> Governor-General <b>of</b> Tuvalu.|$|R
30|$|An example {{could be}} the drop in London subway {{patronage}} in 2003, which is mostly <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temporary closure <b>of</b> a subway line due to an accident.|$|R
50|$|On the Iberian peninsula, <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> motillas-type {{settlements in}} the period after 2200 BCE {{is believed to be}} <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> severe aridification that affected this area.|$|R
5|$|Deciding {{to speak}} with Janos, Raziel orders Moebius to send him further back in time. Moebius deceives Raziel, instead {{conveying}} him over a century into the future, where he and The Elder God highlight <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pillars' destruction to turn Raziel against Kain. Raziel navigates the future era and finds his own {{way back to the}} age of the Sarafan and Janos Audron. There, Janos presents Raziel with the Reaver, a younger version of the physical Soul Reaver blade which will later house a soul-devouring spirit. Suddenly, a group of Sarafan led by Raziel's former, human self launch an ambush, and Janos sacrifices himself. Raziel swears vengeance as Janos dies, and pursues the attackers. He uses the Reaver to kill them and his younger self, renouncing his Sarafan past.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{overwhelmingly}} {{controlled by}} Protestant and Catholic missions, which were {{also responsible for}} providing limited medical and welfare support to the rural Congolese. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. One of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant urbanisation. Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{had raised}} $1.7 {{million by the}} time he was forced to abandon the Marathon. He {{realized}} that the nation was about to see <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease, and hoped that this might lead to greater generosity. A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the {{constitution}} is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land. In other words, it is not <b>the</b> source but <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizens' rights.|$|R
50|$|However, on 6 May 2015, Zhang's {{gold medal}} was {{returned}} after further testing performed by independent specialists {{that the presence}} zeranol was <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> contaminated food.|$|R
25|$|Uruguay had lesser effects, {{although}} it suffered <b>the</b> deaths <b>of</b> nearly 5,000 soldiers. As <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the Colorados gained political control of Uruguay and despite some rebellions retained it until 1958.|$|R
5|$|Having been raided twice by the Mongols {{within a}} single year, Transylvania felt <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{invasion}} of 12411242 {{for more than two}} decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de Baltă, had been destroyed. Due to the severe depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, a new wave of colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighişoara and Mediaş; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|Although further persecutionary edicts followed, {{compelling}} {{the arrest}} of the Christian clergy and universal acts of sacrifice, the persecutionary edicts were ultimately unsuccessful; most Christians escaped punishment, and pagans too were generally unsympathetic to the persecution. The martyrs' sufferings strengthened the resolve of their fellow Christians. Constantius and Maximian did not apply the later persecutionary edicts, and left the Christians of the West unharmed. Galerius rescinded the edict in 311, announcing that the persecution had failed to bring Christians back to traditional religion. The temporary apostasy of some Christians, and the surrendering of scriptures, during the persecution {{played a major role}} in the subsequent Donatist controversy. Within twenty-five years of the persecution's inauguration, the Christian Emperor Constantine would rule the empire alone. He would reverse <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edicts, and return all confiscated property to Christians. Under Constantine's rule, Christianity would become the empire's preferred religion. Diocletian was demonized by his Christian successors: Lactantius intimated that Diocletian's ascendancy heralded the apocalypse, and in Serbian mythology, Diocletian is remembered as Dukljan, the adversary of God.|$|E
5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case <b>of</b> necessary defense). <b>The</b> necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling <b>the</b> police. Also, <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessity must be less serious than <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endangering act (proportionality).|$|R
30|$|In women {{presenting}} with pelvic endometriosis, <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive symptoms could {{rather be}} <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irritation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive tract by local inflammatory phenomena {{than that of}} an actual infiltration by the disease.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} effect is <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grain extraction by dissolution {{and also by}} <b>the</b> beating <b>of</b> rain drops on concrete surface. The concrete is weakened by the solvent effect as appears in the mineralogical analyses.|$|R
5|$|Doom and his toon henchmen {{discover}} Roger, {{but he and}} Valiant escape with Benny, an anthropomorphic taxicab. They flee to a theater, where Valiant {{explains to}} Roger that a toon killed Teddy when they were investigating a crime in Toontown. As they leave with Dolores, Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf, a mysterious corporation that bought the city's trolley network shortly before Acme's murder. Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon, leaving Roger to guard outside, but Jessica knocks Roger out and puts him in the trunk. Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company {{so that he could}} then sell the studio, but is killed before he can explain <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing will. Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene and, assuming she is the culprit, follows her into Toontown. Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon and that the former had given her his will for safe-keeping, but she discovered that the will was blank. She and Valiant are soon captured by Doom and the weasels.|$|E
5|$|In 974, Izz al-Dawla {{was trapped}} in Wasit by his troops who under leader Sebük-Tegin had rebelled against him. Adud al-Dawla quickly left Fars to quell the rebellion, where he inflicted a decisive defeat on the rebels on January 30, 975, who under their new leader Alptakin fled to Syria. Adud al-Dawla then made a plot which forced Izz al-Dawla to abdicate in his favor on March 12, 975. Rukn al-Dawla, greatly angered at this action, protested against Adud al-Dawla, {{claiming}} that the line of Mu'izz al-Dawla could not be removed from power. Adud al-Dawla tried to make an agreement with his father by proposing {{to pay tribute to}} him. Rukn al-Dawla, however, rejected his offer, and then restored Izz al-Dawla as the ruler of Iraq. <b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restoration of Izz al-Dawla would later lead to war between him and Adud al-Dawla after the death of Rukn al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{protected}} János Kádár's {{economic reforms}} and {{his position as}} leader of the People's Republic of Hungary from intervention by the Soviet leadership. Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, who was removed from all of his posts in 1970, was succeeded by Edward Gierek who tried to revitalise the economy of the People's Republic of Poland by borrowing money from the First World. The Soviet leadership approved both countries' respective economic experiments, since it was trying to reduce its large Eastern Bloc subsidy programme in the form of cheap oil and gas exports. During the discussions within the Soviet leadership of a possible Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia Kosygin reminded leaders of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet suppression of the 1956 Hungarian revolution. Kosygin's stance became more aggressive later on when he understood that the reforms in Czechoslovakia could be turned against his 1965 Soviet economic reform.|$|E
50|$|Dimensionally in the ESU CGS system, charge q is {{therefore}} equivalent to m1/2L3/2t−1. Hence, neither charge nor current {{is an independent}} physical quantity in ESU CGS. This reduction <b>of</b> units is <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buckingham π theorem.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> result <b>of</b> GT {{power output}} is <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam {{demand in the}} plant, since the whole thermal power must be {{produced}} in the HRSG. There is always surplus electricity, which is exported to the grid.|$|R
50|$|An all-time Commonwealth Youth Games from 2000 Commonwealth Youth Games to 2015 Commonwealth Youth Games, is {{tabulated}} below.
