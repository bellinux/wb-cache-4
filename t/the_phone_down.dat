I banged <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down</b> not believing a word of what he said". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer. The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal, Shiv Subramnayam, Hrishikesh Joshi, Rajatava Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles. For the role of drug dealer Tashi, Bhardwaj chose his friend Tenzing Nimaa tour operator in Mussooriesaying he had the character and attitude he wanted, and a weird sense of humour.|$|E

Around {{the time of its}} release, however, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam fell out over a misunderstanding involving the press and have not spoken since. This long-suspected situation was finally confirmed by Bewes while promoting his autobiography in 2005. Unlike Bewes, Bolam is consistently reluctant to talk about the show, and has vetoed any attempt to revive his character.The final breach, as Bewes told it, occurred after Bolam's wife, Sue, announced to her husband, while he was driving, that she was pregnant. He almost crashed the car. Bewes repeated this story in a newspaper interview, thinking that it was already public knowledge, then got a frosty reaction when he rang Bolam to forewarn him. [...] "There was this dreadful silence. He put <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down.</b> I called him back. He didn't answer. He hasn't spoken to me since", Bewes claimed. }} ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{announcement}} {{came as a}} {{shock to}} Italians and non-Italians alike. Umberto Eco expressed delight that the award had been given to someone who [...] "does not belong to the traditional academic world." [...] However, 86-year-old Italian literary critic Carlo Bo was mystified: [...] "I must be too old to understand. What does this mean? That everything changes, even literature has changed." [...] Fo's fellow Italian laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini expressed bewilderment when asked for her thoughts and wondered if Fo were Italian. Mario Luzi, a poet regarded as a likely next Italian recipient at the time, slammed <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down</b> on one reporter: [...] "I'll say only this. I've just about had it up to here!" [...] Reaction from the English-speaking world was also particularly fierce, with representatives from many English-speaking countries regarding Fo's work as unfashionable and outdated, belonging to the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. playwright Tony Kushner, however, expressed his approval, writing: [...] " [...] has dedicated his genius to making everything he touches debatable. [...] is brave and perhaps even reckless because it subjects Literature, and prizes, and Newspapers of Record, to the Fo effect". When he accepted the award, Fo presented a specially devised piece called Contra jogulatores obloquentes (Against Jesters of Irreverent Speech) alongside some paintings, with this later being described as [...] "undoubtedly the most flamboyantly theatrical and comical acceptance speech ever seen at the Swedish Academy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roberts {{had asked}} the CIGS John French {{to come and see}} him at Ascot on 19 March; French had been too busy but invited Roberts to visit him when next in London. On the morning of 21 March Roberts and French had an acrimonious {{telephone}} conversation in which Roberts told French that he would share the blame if he collaborated with the Cabinet's [...] "dastardly" [...] attempt to coerce Ulster, and then, after French told him that he would [...] "do his duty as a soldier" [...] and obey lawful orders, put <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down</b> on him. Soon after, Roberts received a telegram from Hubert Gough, purporting to ask for advice, although possibly designed to goad him into further action. Roberts requested an audience with King George V, who told him that Seely (Secretary of State for War), to whom the King had recently spoken, had complained that Roberts was [...] "at the bottom" [...] of the matter, had incited Gough, and had called the politicians [...] "swine and robbers" [...] in his phone conversation with French. Roberts indignantly denied this, claiming that he had not been in contact with Gough for [...] "years" [...] and that he had advised officers not to resign. Roberts' claim may not be the whole truth as Gough was on first name terms with Roberts' daughter and later gave her copies of key documents relating to the Incident.|$|E

Healy is seen typing 'Lover' into her laptop, but then deletes the L so it spells 'Over'. As the video comes to an end, the band are seen in a night club dancing, then leaving the club.|$|E
2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down.</b> They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back.

2500|$|Hart was {{notorious for}} pulling {{elaborate}} [...] "ribs" [...] (pranks) on fellow wrestlers. During a shoot interview Tony Norris, who wrestled in the WWF during the mid-90's as Ahmed Johnson and faced Hart {{in the ring}} on many occasions, stated that he had {{received a phone call}} saying he was to be featured as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. After spending a large amount of money on new clothes for the occasion, he was told a limousine was to pick him up and deliver him to the studio. After waiting a seemingly long time, he says that Hart appeared and asked him why he wasn't at the show yet. Norris, suspicious as to how Hart could've known about his guest appearance as he had not told anyone, said that Hart was then on the ground laughing; he then realized that Hart was behind the ruse and there was no guest spot on The Tonight Show. Despite this, Norris spoke very highly of Hart and said that he had loved working with him. During the segments of wrestlers sharing stories about Hart during the RAW IS OWEN broadcast following his death, Shane McMahon mentions Hart and himself taking his brother Bret's wrestling boots and hiding them in a shower. Shane mentioned he was fearful of what Bret would do when he found out. In his autobiography, his brother Bret spoke of a time when he, their father Stu, and Bret's oldest daughter Jade were in a hotel room during the WrestleMania IV weekend when Stu received a phone call apparently from former bodybuilder and wrestler Reg Park, who said that he was calling from the hotel's lobby. [...] Having been acquaintances before, Stu was originally cordial until Park supposedly began accusing him of cowardice and challenging him to a confrontation. [...] Bret mentions Stu becoming extremely irritated to the point of anger and was ready to meet Park face to face until he slammed <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down,</b> mentioning that it was Owen all along.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>down,</b> thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E
