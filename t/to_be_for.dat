Though the suspension was announced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> {{the remainder of the}} season, due to his meeting of specific criteria set by the football staff, he was eventually reinstated after missing eight games.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E

5|$|East Stirlingshire plays {{its home}} matches at Ochilview Park {{which is the}} home ground of local rivals Stenhousemuir. After leaving Firs Park in 2008, the club entered a ground-share {{agreement}} with Stenhousemuir, originally intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a period of five years during which the club planned {{to develop a new}} stadium in Falkirk. In May 2014 East Stirlinghire FC entered into a partnership with LK Galaxy Sports and others to develop a new playing facility at the former BP Club site at Little Kerse, Grange Road, Grangemouth. The site will also host other sports in due course. Planning has recently been approved by Falkirk Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Chotiner {{served as}} {{campaign}} manager for Knowland. Knowland cross-filed and won both major party primaries, virtually assuring his re-election. The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, which was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> Congressional use only, though he apparently made no public use of the file in the campaign. Holt defeated Tenney in the primary, {{and went on to}} win the general election.|$|E
5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E

5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E
5|$|Nine was {{originally}} announced in August 2001 {{under the title}} Shin Megami Tensei Online. Originally rumored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the PS2, its announced features included use of voice recognition and online broadband services. These features would later be clarified as being planned for online implementation rather than in development. After {{a long period of}} media silence, its official title was announced in February 2002. Nine was heavily promoted at multiple Japanese gaming events throughout 2002. The game released on December 5, 2002: it was celebrated with an official launch event attended by Okada and Kaneko. A Deluxe Edition released simultaneously with the standard edition, containing a figurine of Maria and a keycard related to accessing online content. The game was later re-released as part of Microsoft's Platinum Collection budget collection on October 23, 2003. A novelization, written by Takumi Miyajima and with a cover illustration by Kaneko, was published by Fujimi Shobo on March 25, 2003. A comics anthology was released by Enterbrain on March 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept that}} would become Nier was first {{proposed}} following the release of Drakengard 2 and the reveal of seventh generation consoles. The original concept was for a third entry in the Drakengard series. It was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> PlayStation 3 due to the lessening importance of the PlayStation 2, which Drakengard 2 had been made for. However, as the project evolved, the original ideas were reworked and the game eventually became a spin-off from the main series. Despite this, the game's director Yoko Taro continues {{to think of it}} as the third Drakengard game. Including concept planning, the total development time lasted three years, with two years spent actually developing the game. It was initially a small-scale project, but during planning it grew into a full-fledged role-playing game. Development was handled by Cavia with help from Square Enix, who had previously provided development support for the Drakengard games. Square Enix had minimal input on Yoko's vision for the game's atmosphere and story, allowing him high creative control.|$|E

5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of osmium appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO4), {{which is a}} highly toxic compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of most seabirds is less {{colourful}} {{than that}} of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), {{but most of the}} colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs. The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is {{the same as that of}} Antarctic prions, and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below).|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{accepted}} by the league at its May 15, 1927 meeting in Montreal. The criteria for winning was variously reported. The Montreal Gazette and The Globe and Mail reported that it was 'to be awarded each year to the goaltender in the National Hockey League having the best (goals against) average,' while the Toronto Star reported that the trophy went to the 'most valuable' goaltender in the league. When Hainsworth won his third Vezina {{at the end of}} the 1928–29 NHL season, the trophy was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the 'most outstanding' goaltender in the league. However, later reports state that the trophy was based on the lowest goals against average (GAA).|$|E

5|$|Theobald {{also had}} a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over {{the right of the}} {{archbishop}} to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.|$|E
5|$|This {{may have}} been {{for any number of}} reasons. Since paper was very expensive, Ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on slate, and then {{transfer}} just the results to paper. Using a slate was common for mathematics students in the Madras Presidency at the time. He was also quite likely to have been influenced by the style of G. S. Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.|$|E
5|$|Today, poison is {{used for}} {{a wider variety of}} {{purposes}} than it used <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>For</b> example, poison can be used to rid an unwanted infestation by pests or to kill weeds. Such chemicals, known as pesticides, have been known to be used in some form since about 2500 BC. However, the use of pesticides has increased staggeringly from 1950, and presently approximately 2.5 million tons of industrial pesticides are used each year. Other poisons {{can also be used to}} preserve foods and building material.|$|E
