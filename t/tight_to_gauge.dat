2500|$|Compound-action snips {{are also}} known as {{aviation}} snips because they were developed to cut aluminum {{in the construction of}} aircraft. They can handle aluminium up <b>to</b> 18 <b>gauge,</b> mild steel up <b>to</b> 24 <b>gauge</b> or stainless steel up <b>to</b> 26 <b>gauge.</b> These type of snips have become the most popular because of the linkage that increases the mechanical advantage without increasing the length of the snips. There are three cutting styles: straight cutting, left cutting, and right cutting. [...] Straight cutting snips (generally have yellow colored soft grips) cut in a straight line and wide curves; left cutting snips (usually red) will cut straight and in a <b>tight</b> curve <b>to</b> the left; right cutting snips (usually green) will cut straight and in a <b>tight</b> curve <b>to</b> the right. These different cutting styles are necessary because metal is stiff and heavy and does not move out of the way readily when cutting around a curve. The respective styles move the material out of the way when cutting in the direction they are designed for. The blades are usually serrated to prevent material slippage.|$|R
