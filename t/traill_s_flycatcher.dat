40|$|Notable this Fall {{was very}} heavy {{coverage}} of the Panhandle during Sep-Oct, which yielded several outstanding records (all, of course, pending NOURC approval). Incredible were first Panhandle records of Golden-winged, Chestnut-sided, Bay-breasted, and Prothonotary Warblers, 3 rd record of Northern Waterthrush, and 4 th record of Blackburnian Warbler. Philadelphia Vireo {{was found in the}} Panhandle for the 3 rd time. Important also were 3 records of Hammond 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Flycatcher,</b> the 3 rd- 6 th for the state, and likely a regular migrant, and 5 of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s vireo, previously known only by 2 specimens. Finally, from the Panhandle, 4 reports of Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher may be changing the status of this species there; there are still fewer than 10 such records. Just as significant were 2 surprising easterly records, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebe in Lancaster Co and a Plumbeous Vireo in Stanton Co. Rarities independent of location were a potential 1 st state record Eurasian Collared-Dove at Shelton; the NOURC will decide if this was (is!) a wild bird. It was a good fall for jaegers, 4 reported (2 identified to species, a 2 nd state record Parasitic and a 4 tn state record Pomarine. A Roseate Spoonbill flew into NE airspace for the state 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd record. The OPPD Wetlands mitigation project in e Otoe Co yielded interesting waterbirds which are lacking in e NE due to virtually lacking cattail marsh habitat. Species seen there were Least Bittern, Yellow-crowned Night-Heron, King Rail, and Common Moorhen. Other species appeared in surprising numbers. There were single-locality, single-day counts of 3 Red-necked Grebes, 20, 000 + Western Grebes, 10 Tundra Swans, 191 Hooded Mergansers, 54 Northern Harriers, 35, 000 and 30, 000 Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls, up to 30 Sabine 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls (for the season), 4000 Cliff Swallows, and 39 Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers.

40|$|This {{spring was}} a fairly normal, {{although}} I heard comments about warblers being rather tough to find. The reports did confirm that {{for many of the}} migrant northwoods species. There were a few rarities, none represented first state records, however. Foremost of these were White Ibis, Glossy Ibis, blue-morph Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Goos, Common Crane, Band-tailed Pigeon, Hammond 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Flycatcher,</b> and Black-throated Gray Warbler. The following birds may join these, although each may have fatal flaws, at least {{in the eyes of the}} NOURC: Red Phalarope and Slaty-backed Gull. Other interesting sightings included a Mississippi Kite in Lincoln; Gray Partridges in Scotts Bluff Co; 11 th state records for both Little Gull and Mew Gull; a 10 th location for Eurasian Collared-Dove; another (maybe?) White-winged Dove; Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widows in the Kearney area; Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpeckers in West Ash Creek Canyon; Pileated Woodpeckers continuing in Fontenelle Forest; an Acadian Flycatcher in Dixon Co; Blue-winged and Prairie Warblers near each other in Carter Canyon; the 17 th spring record of Pine Warbler but still with none documented; the 9 th (!) Panhandle Hooded Warbler; and the 10 th eastern record of Lazuli Bunting. A note is in order about reports of rare birds, either rare on a state level, or rare at the location or season. Each season I receive several such reports, many with excellent details of how the bird was identified. Those without details present a dilemma. In this (and subsequent) reports I will note observers of such sightings and follow their initials with 2 ̆ 2 details 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 no details 2 ̆ 2. The latter implies that the report, while possibly correct, is unverifiably so. This information is important for researchers who follow us and might have difficulty deciding which reports are substantiated and thus useful on a scientific level. While I make an effort to get details prior to writing this report, I am unable to contact some observers (especially those without email!). Observers who have a 2 ̆ 2 no details 2 ̆ 2 report listed here are encouraged to send details, even if they are late. I forward any information I receive on state-level rarities to Joel Jorgensen, Secretary of the NOU Records Committee, the body charged with maintaining the official state bird list...|$|R

Durante o ano de 2003 foram registradas 188 observações de forrageamento para S. affinis e 150 para S. islerorum. Foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre as duas espécies em relação à altura e substrato de forrageamento, fitofisionomia utilizada e densidade da folhagem {{no local}} do ataque. O comportamento e a direção do ataque, a espécie de planta e a distância de vôo não diferiram entre as espécies. A análise de 26 conteúdos estomacais de membros do gênero revelou o consumo exclusivo de artrópodes. A baixa porcentagem de observações de forrageamento direcionadas a frutos (apenas 7 % e 9 %, respectivamente) confirmou o caráter insetívoro do gênero.

40|$|First of all, I want {{to thank}} Joel Jorgensen for helping write these reports {{for the last few}} years. Joel has decided to spend his limited free time on Records Committee matters; he is {{currently}} Chairman. Over the last few years, Joel has made significant contributions to Nebraska ornithology, particularly through his! meticulous counts of shorebirds in the Rainwater Basin. This season proved interesting in terms of ranges of breeding birds, as discussed in the accounts. See, for example, Little Blue Heron, the dOWitchers. Black-billed Magpie, White-breasted Nuthatch, Sedge Wren, and the towhees. There seems to be an increasing number of 2 ̆ 2 displaced 2 ̆ 2 birds, either early or late 2 ̆ 7 migrants or birds just in the wrong places. Could this situation result from an increasingly unstable atmosphere? Very late in spring were Hudsonian Godwit and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, while very early in fall were Willet, Semipalmated Sandpiper. and Orange-crowned Warbler. Birds in the wrong places were numerous, but significant were a 2 ̆ 2 small race 2 ̆ 2 Canada Goose, ducks such as American Wigeon. Green-winged Teal, Bufflehead, and Common Goldeneye, Mississippi Kite away from Ogallala, adult Golden Eagle eastward, adult American Golden-Plover in July. westerly Least Terns, northerly Acadian Flycatcher, singing mid-June Blue-winged Warblers, Yellow-breasted Chats in Harlan Co, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow in the RWB. Interesting breeding or possible breeding records involved Eurasian Collared Dove 2 ̆ 7 s 2 nd breeding location, Long-eared Owl, Pileated Woodpecker, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire, and MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler. 2 ̆ 2 Good birds 2 ̆ 2 were King Rail, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Woodpecker, Scissor-tailed <b>Flycatcher,</b> Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Hooded Warbler, and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, and, best till last, the White Ibis, only the state 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd report, but first with extant documentation. Finally, where were the Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpipers? When was the last time only one was reported for the early fall? Presumably the adults went elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|A biologia reprodutiva de Suiriri affinis (suiriri-do-cerrado) e S. islerorum (suiriri-da-chapada) é descrita pela primeira vez. O ninho de S. affinis é em forma de cesto raso, sendo construído com fibras vegetais e forrado por painas, sendo todas essas camadas firmemente unidas por grande quantidade de teia de aranha. O seu {{exterior}} é ornamentado com liquens e fragmentos de folhas secas. O ninho é apoiado pela base e laterais entre dois ou mais ramos divergentes. Embora superficialmente similar, o ninho de S. islerorum apresenta várias diferenças, sendo mais baixo, raso e apoiado pelas laterais entre uma forquilha. O seu interior é forrado por uma camada adicional de fibras vegetais por sobre as painas. A construção dos ninhos de ambas as espécies é exclusividade das fêmeas. Os ovos de S. affinis são branco-perolados (média de 20, 8 x 15, 1 mm, 2, 5 g), enquanto que os de S. islerorum são creme claro (20, 4 x 15, 4 mm, 2, 4 g), apresentando uma coroa de manchas marrons escuras ao redor do pólo rombo. Os filhotes de S. affinis apresentam a cabeça, superfície dorsal e coberteiras das asas marcadas por abundantes e diminutas manchas brancas, enquanto que os filhotes de S. islerorum são semelhantes aos adultos. A incubação é realizada exclusivamente pelas fêmeas, sendo estimada em 15, 2 dias para ambas as espécies. Já os filhotes de S. affinis e S. islerorum permanecem no ninho por 18, 9 e 18, 3 dias, respectivamente. Algumas evidências sugerem que S. affinis apresenta alguma forma de reprodução cooperativa. The breeding {{biology of}} Suiriri affinis (Campo Suiriri) and <b>S.</b> islerorum (Chapada <b>Flycatcher)</b> is described {{for the first}} time. The nest of S. affinis is a basket constructed mainly with vegetable fibers and lined with {{a thick layer of}} silk cotton. All its exterior is ornamented with lichens and dry leaf fragments. All those layers are firmly attached to each other by a large amount of spider web. The nest is supported by its bottom and sides between two or more divergent branches. Although superficially similar, the nest of S. islerorum present many differences, being shorter, shallower, and supported only by its sides between a forked branch. Its interior is also lined by an additional layer of vegetable fibers over the silk cotton layer. The nest of both species is constructed exclusively by the females. The eggs of S. affinis (mean of 20. 8 x 15. 1 mm, 2. 5 g) are pearl white, and those of S. islerorum (20. 4 x 15. 4 mm, 2. 4 g) are light cream, presenting a wreath of small brown blotches around its thicker end. The fledglings of S. islerorum are very similar to the adults, while those of S. affinis present the head, back and wing coverts largely tipped white. The incubation is performed only by the female, lasting 15. 2 days for both species. The nestling period of S. affinis and S. islerorum is of 18. 9 and 18. 3 days, respectively. Some evidences suggests that S. affinis may be a cooperative breeder...|$|R
