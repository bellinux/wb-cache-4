I couldn't grumble about <b>that.</b> <b>We</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get on very well, and he would listen to the {{instructions}} I gave him. Then he became world famous!" [...] The respect was mutual: though Greaves described the Chelsea title-winning side as [...] "almost certainly one of the least talented teams ever to win the title", he made an exception for McNichol, [...] "the ball player of the team".

As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo.

On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

As {{he said in the}} November 2001 issue of Maximum PC, [...] "Unreal Tournament would not have sold nearly two million copies if it did not have support from the community... We ship the very same tools <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> build the game, and folks use these tools to realize their own visions of first-person action." [...] Like Unreal, Unreal Tournament is designed to be easily programmable and highly modularized. Through its scripting environment UnrealScript and level editor UnrealEd, developers are able to modify easily most parts of the game to both manipulate default game behavior and to supplement the game with their own mods. These range from slight changes on some aspects of gameplay (such as map voting) to total conversions. One modification, ChaosUT, became popular enough that it was included with the 'Game of the Year' edition of the game, while [...] was released as a stand-alone retail product.|$|E

This is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season entry, [...] "Goodbye, Michael", and his first directing credited since season seven's [...] "PDA". This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the first season episode [...] "Basketball" [...] and the fourth season opener, [...] "Fun Run". Daniels later revealed that [...] "New Guys" [...] would be the inception of big season arcs.

2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] I like the idea of storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get, to people who are just into shoot-em-up action films."
