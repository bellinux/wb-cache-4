5|$|After Germany surrendered, the Allies {{partitioned}} Berlin and Germany's remaining territory {{into four}} military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany. East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital, while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital, to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and <b>temporary</b> <b>status</b> quo.|$|E
5|$|Within certain conditions, {{characters}} {{can perform}} Special Moves, customizable powerful moves tied to Jobs: after a Special Move is performed, the entire party is granted buffs {{for a limited}} period. This period is represented with a specific tune that plays over normal battle music. Various elements {{can be added to}} Special Moves, such as granting elemental properties, launching status ailments at enemies, recovering HP and MP, and <b>temporary</b> <b>status</b> ailment immunity to the party. The customization of Special Moves is directly tied to the creation of specialist shops during the reconstruction of Norende. Experience points acquired {{at the end of a}} battle enable characters and their assigned Jobs to level up, unlocking new abilities and boosting character stats such as available HP and MP. Bonuses are gained if the party fulfilled certain conditions. Job abilities and levels can also be borrowed from online friends, in a feature called Abilink. Any Job can be borrowed from available players regardless of their current level.|$|E

25|$|Slavery was a {{component}} of Cherokee society prior to European contact, as they took captives as slaves. By their oral tradition, the Cherokee viewed slavery {{as the result of}} an individual's failure in warfare and as a <b>temporary</b> <b>status,</b> pending release or the slave's adoption into the tribe. In colonial times, the English and later the British purchased or impressed Cherokee as slaves during the period of the Indian Slave Trade in the early 18th century.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{the civil}} war in Somalia led to a large number of Somali immigrants, {{comprising}} the majority of the current Somali population in the UK. In the late-1980s, most of these early migrants were granted asylum, while those arriving later in the 1990s more often obtained <b>temporary</b> <b>status.</b> There has also been some secondary migration of Somalis to the UK from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The main driving forces behind this secondary migration included a desire to reunite with family and friends and for better employment opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Lee made six out {{of eleven}} PGA Tour cuts after turning pro, with two top-25 finishes. He tied for 13th at the HP Byron Nelson Championship in May, and {{improved}} on his best finish in a PGA Tour event by finishing in a tie for 7th at the AT National in July. That top ten finish earned Lee {{a spot in the}} following week's John Deere Classic, meaning {{he did not have to}} use one of his two remaining sponsor exemptions. The money from his T-7 finish put him $187,904 away from earning <b>temporary</b> <b>status</b> on tour. Lee missed the cut by two strokes at the John Deere Classic after bogeying the last two holes of his second round. Lee missed the cut again three weeks later at the Buick Open.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} {{sensitivity of}} the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab-Israeli peace process, included a <b>temporary</b> <b>status</b> agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the waqf (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes {{the whole of the}} southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. In consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. One of these days is the Shabbat Chayei Sarah, when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{the civil}} war in Somalia lead to a large number of Somali immigrants, {{comprising}} the majority of the current Somali population in the UK. Between 1988 and 1994, the favoured destination of people fleeing {{the civil war}} was Scandinavia, but by 1999 53 per cent of Somali asylum applications in Europe were made in the UK. Many of these asylum seekers had fled from neighbouring countries such as Ethiopia before migrating to the UK. Many of these refugees were women and children whose men had either been killed or had stayed in Somalia to fight, changing the Somali settlement from one of single seamen to that of refugee communities. Between 1985 and 2006, Somalis figured among the top ten largest country of origin groups of people seeking asylum in the UK. In the late 1980s, most of these early migrants were granted refugee status, while those arriving later in the 1990s more often obtained <b>temporary</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
25|$|People whose asylum {{applications}} {{have been}} rejected but who {{remain in the}} UK constitute {{one of a number}} of categories of irregular immigrants. In 2010, 270 Somalis had their asylum claims rejected in final decisions. The British government has a declared policy of not deporting failed asylum seekers to Somalia as it considers it too dangerous for return, although it has forcibly returned people to regions of the country that are more stable and accessible by air, such as Somaliland. In April 2014 the Home Office issued new advice to its case workers, suggesting that it is now safe to return people to the capital, Mogadishu. However, in a test case in June 2014, a judge granted an injunction to halt that deportation of a Somali man to Mogadishu. Some Somalis had been returned to Mogadishu prior to the issuance of new guidance, and the returns were subject to criticism from members of the Somali community as well as human rights groups and organisations. Of those Somalis whose asylum claims have been declined or whose <b>temporary</b> <b>status</b> had expired, some have voluntarily repatriated. Many others have been subject to indefinite detention in immigration detention centres.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{was hired}} by the United States Bureau of the Mint as a Class D {{temporary}} clerk in 1904, when she was 38 years old, older than most new employees. She served in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Bureau of the Mint, where Mint Director George E. Roberts was impressed by her business experience and competence. [...] Initially having only <b>temporary</b> <b>status,</b> she was made a permanent employee in 1905, and was promoted again that year to Clerk Class I at a salary of $1,200. When Margaret Kelly was commissioned Examiner of the Bureau of the Mint in 1911, the ripple of promotions in her wake included O'Reilly, who became adjuster of accounts. [...] This made her in effect the chief clerk of the Mint Bureau, with responsibility for reviewing all contracts. According to Teva J. Scheer, biographer of Nellie Tayloe Ross (O'Reilly's final Mint Director before retirement) [...] "it must have required an almost unprecedented combination of drive and intelligence for [...] to have climbed so far up through the organization in her male-dominated work environment".|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 17th century, Europe had {{a growing}} demand for tobacco. [...] However, {{in areas of the}} American south, where tobacco grew well, capital was needed in order to grow this highly {{demanding}} crop. [...] These farmers saw tobacco as merely a temporary crop to get them started until they could plant something else. [...] Their reasoning behind the <b>temporary</b> <b>status</b> given to tobacco had to do with low prices. [...] During the 17th century in Virginia, tobacco was selling for pennies per pound.

2500|$|Among other {{sporting}} events {{held at the}} Coliseum over the years were games of Major League Baseball, which were held at the Coliseum when the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League relocated from Brooklyn, New York in 1958. The Dodgers played here until Dodger Stadium was completed {{in time for the}} 1962 season. [...] Even allowing for its <b>temporary</b> <b>status,</b> the Coliseum was extremely ill-suited for baseball, which requires roughly 2.5 times more area than a football gridiron. As a result, foul territory was almost nonexistent down the first base line, but was very expansive down the third base line with a very large backstop for the catcher. Sight lines also left much to be desired; some seats were as far as [...] from the plate. Also, from baseball's point of view, the locker rooms were huge, because they were designed for football (not baseball) teams.|$|E

[...] With the breakout of the Cold War, the usefulness of the airfield by the Air Force became limited, as Giebelstadt was simply too close to the East German border to station tactical aircraft. [...] The flight time for jet aircraft from the border was less than 15 minutes, which meant little or no time was available to launch aircraft from the field before it coming under attack. [...] The airfield, however, remained active as various MATS C-54 Skymaster transport units used the base during 1951-1952; then it was used by various transient transport aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
