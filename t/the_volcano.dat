5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes {{follow a}} {{well-established}} {{life cycle of}} growth and erosion. After a new volcano forms, its lava output gradually increases.

Erosion then weathers <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E

50|$|In October 2006, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{adopted a}} {{nationwide}} alert system for characterizing {{the level of}} unrest and eruptive activity at <b>volcanoes.</b> <b>The</b> system is now used by <b>the</b> Alaska <b>Volcano</b> Observatory, <b>the</b> California <b>Volcano</b> Observatory (California and Nevada), <b>the</b> Cascades <b>Volcano</b> Observatory (Washington, Oregon and Idaho), <b>the</b> Hawaiian <b>Volcano</b> Observatory and <b>the</b> Yellowstone <b>Volcano</b> Observatory (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona).|$|R
5|$|Monitoring of <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> and {{predictions}} of large eruptions {{are particularly important}} because of its location in a densely populated area, {{with the city of}} Kagoshima's 680,000 residents just a few kilometers from <b>the</b> <b>volcano.</b> The city conducts regular evacuation drills, and a number of shelters have been built where people can take refuge from falling volcanic debris.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> and subsidence of the seafloor cause <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> to gradually diminish. As <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E

5|$|The name of {{the peak}} was {{suggested}} by an explorer named Chris Dickinson during the Cambridge Coast Mountains Expedition in 1979. It was adopted on November 24, 1980, and has been its official name since then. However, this name for the peak does not normally show up in any volcanological resources. Instead, it is informally referred to as Lava Fork or Lava Fork volcano due to its close association with the creek of the same name. The reason for this controversy is because <b>The</b> <b>Volcano</b> is generic. In speech {{it may not be}} obvious whether <b>The</b> <b>Volcano</b> or <b>the</b> <b>volcano</b> is intended, leading to confusion. Similar named volcanoes in Canada include Volcano Vent in the Tuya volcanic field of northwestern British Columbia and Volcano Mountain in the Fort Selkirk volcanic field of central Yukon.
