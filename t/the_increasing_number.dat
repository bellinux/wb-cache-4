5|$|Portugal {{designated}} Mozambique {{an overseas}} territory in 1951 {{in order to}} show to the world that the colony had a greater autonomy. It was called the Overseas Province of Mozambique (Província Ultramarina de Moçambique). Nonetheless, Portugal still maintained strong control over its overseas province. <b>The</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of newly independent African nations after World War II, coupled with the ongoing mistreatment of the indigenous population, encouraged the growth of nationalist sentiments within Mozambique.|$|E

5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The court had such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{declaration}} of self-governance, Kedrovsky and the Living Church were awarded the Church's diocesan cathedral in New York City. To prevent further loss of property, the diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties, which made them effectively independent. This, combined with <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other Orthodox jurisdictions (as well as some non-Orthodox), led to a unique situation in Orthodox America whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically. The remainder of the American Church became known informally as the Metropolia (or {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Metropolitan). Following Patriarch Tikhon's death, the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Metropolitan Sergius, began cooperating with the Soviet government. In 1933, the Russian Church declared the Metropolia to be schismatic.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Fr. Antonio Mateo, the Vicar of Tayabas, became {{suspicious}} of the cofradías monthly masses and fees, thus Fr. Manuel Sancho stopped holding Masses for the cofradía. Mateo and Sancho then accused the cofradía of conducting heretical activities. Due to religious persecution and <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of its members, Pule decided to have the cofradía recognized by the colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church. He first sought recognition and authorization from the Bishop of Camarines but his request was denied.

5|$|In 2012, endometrial cancers newly {{occurred}} in 320,000women and caused 76,000deaths.

It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.|$|E

Following the shore bombardments, Indiana joined the task force that had assembled to invade Okinawa; the ship provided ground support fire as well as anti-aircraft defense against <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of Kamikazes that were attacking the invasion fleet.

On 8 April 1948, the 4th Dogra Battalion {{advanced}} to Rajauri. During the advance, the battalion attacked and captured the Barwali ridge, eleven kilometers {{to the north of}} Naushahra. The battalion's advance beyond Barwali was obstructed by <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of roadblocks and minefields. Supporting tanks were also unable to cross the obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Several {{areas of}} Bath had {{undergone}} development during the Stuart period, and development increased during Georgian times {{in response to}} <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation.

5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The first {{vehicle was}} a trolley bus donated from the Municipal Tramways Trust in 1958 with others soon following. The museum opened as a static display in 1967. Workshops were built {{to enable the}} {{restoration}} of the old trams to operating condition. ICI, then operator of the salt lagoons, donated land for the tramway to run next to St Kilda Road. The tramway opened for trials in 1973 and was officially opened in 1974 by Harry Bowey, mayor of Salisbury, and Frank Kneebone, Minister for Lands, to coincide with St Kilda's centenary. In 2001 a large additional museum building was completed to house <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of donated trams.|$|E
5|$|This hamster {{is listed}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

However, <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of livestock {{in the areas of}} distribution, such as the steppes of central Asia, some burrows are at a small risk of being destroyed.

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it {{as a source of}} drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Butthole Surfers {{began to}} take the {{collection}} of visual equipment seriously following Coffey's recruitment in 1983, when he added a clear plastic drum fitted with a strobe light to their show. Shortly afterwards, the band purchased what was reported as several thousand dollars worth of stolen strobe lights at a bargain rate, and their visual equipment soon took up more space than their instruments. Smoke machines were later added. Equally memorable was the band's propensity for projecting a variety of films behind them as they played, beginning with one 16-millimeter projector, before adding others. This set-up allowed them to play a number of overlapping movies {{at the same time}} which were often strangely angled, upside down or played in reverse. Combined with <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> of strobe lights, the effect created a visually disorienting atmosphere, which occasionally caused epileptic seizures in audience members.|$|E
