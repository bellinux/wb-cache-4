40|$|Axisymmetric load is {{the most}} common load acting on {{flexible}} pipe. Modelling axisymmetric load correctly is very important to estimate the strength of a flexible pipe. The purpose of the thesis is to compare the stress distribution in metallic layers under three load case, i. e. tension, internal pressure and external pressure. Literature study and discussion to mechanical properties of flexible pipe and finite element modelling method are included in the thesis. The modelling program is BFLEX program. Models for three flexible pipes are built in BFLEX for 6 inch pipe, 8 inch pipe and 16 inch pipe. Different element models are applied to model metallic layers. Element PIPE 52 are used to model all metallic layers for ITCODE 31 model. For ITCODE 0 model, element PIPE 52 are used to model carcass and pressure armour; element HSHEAR 352 is used to model helical <b>tensile</b> <b>layer.</b> For full FE model, carcass and pressure armour are modelled by element HSHEAR 363 and <b>tensile</b> <b>layer</b> is modelled by element HSHEAR 353. For ITCODE 31 and ITCODE 0 models, the computing stress is taken from local model after BPOST. For full FE model, the stress is from global model directly. Moreover, analytical solution is found to estimate the modelling performance. </p...|$|E

40|$|There {{are still}} {{quite a lot}} of unknown and unexplainable fields in riser section, whose fatigue damage may cause loss of lives, {{environmental}} pollution and threats to the economy. In this thesis, two methods to find the maximum damage of flexible riser by the local stress analysis tool Bflex are emphasized on. One is using LIFETIME module for ITCODE 0 & 1 and 31. Another is applying FATPROP (fatigue properties) and FAPLOT to 353 FLEXCROSS. The locations of maximum fatigue damages are different from various cross-section types. Element type pipe 52 is applied to ITCODE 31 for both core <b>layers</b> and <b>tensile</b> <b>layers.</b> As to ITCODE 0 & 1, pipe 52 is used for core layers while hshear 352 is used for <b>tensile</b> <b>layers.</b> Regarded with 353 FELXCROSS, the new element hshear 363 is exploited for carcass, seal, zeta, structape as well as outsheath, and hshear 353 is exploited for <b>tensile</b> <b>layers.</b> In addition, contact element hcont 463 is also applied to contact layers when using 353 FLEXCROSS. With different cross-section types and different element types, the model of flexible riser bearing prescribed displacement and internal pressure has been established. After fatigue analysis with alternative shear parameters, the result which contains curvature-stress curves of three different size riser comes out. It is important to see the comparison of these curves among ITCODE 0 & 1, 31 and 353 FLEXCROSS. ITCODE 0 & 1 show the conservative result for stress analysis. The clear differences of different shear modulus from 5 to 1000 can be illustrated vividly by ITCODE 31. Moreover, there is almost no difference modelled by 353 FLEXCROSS. Therefore, ITCODE 31 would be the most reasonable option for stress analysis when we changing the shear modulus considering about slip behavior for flexible risers. </p...|$|R

As shown by Lange and co-workers, the arrested crack propagates stably through the compressive layer under increasing load until a critical load or threshold strength is reached. In 4 -point flexural loading tests, cracks can bifurcate after entering into the compressive layer. This paper presents finite element simulations of bifurcated crack paths and threshold strength prediction in two-dimensional approximation.

40|$|Summary. Rocks have a {{significant}} thermal expansion coefficient and a high modulus of elasticity. Small thermal changes can therefore generate very sub-stantial stresses. A convenient idealized example is the mechanically free, cooling thermal boundary layer in a material that suddenly turns from plastic to rigid in cooling through a ‘rigidus ’ temperature. This simplified case can be solved analytically for both a linear and an error function temperature profile. A compressed layer develops near the surface, with a logarithmic singularity of stress at the boundary. At a depth of 0. 2 of the elastic thickness, the stress changes to tensile, and peaks at 15 per cent of the confined shrinkage stress {{in the middle of}} the rigid layer. The situation is similar to the stresses in one half of a piece of tempered glass. Like the tempered glass, both the cooling lithosphere and a plated boundary to a magma chamber are subject to breakage when cracks are induced in the <b>tensile</b> <b>layer.</b> Positive pore (magma) pressure is required to overcome con-fining pressure at depth in the lithosphere, but cracking could becom...|$|E

An integrated approach {{to the design of}} ceramic laminates incorporating biaxial residual stresses for specific applications is outlined. Restrictions placed on the laminate architecture to avoid spontaneous transverse cracking of the <b>tensile</b> <b>layer</b> are discussed. The phenomena of edge cracking and crack bifurcation are considered with reference to elastic moduli, Poisson's ratio, mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients, temperature gradient and laminate architecture. The use of compressive layers to produce a material that exhibits a threshold strength and criteria for increasing the critical applied stress below which failure will not occur are reported. A single edge V-notched beam (SEVNB) test geometry was used to measure crack growth resistance (R curve) behaviour of multilayer Si 3 N 4 /Si 3 N 4 -TiN composites. Fracture mechanics weight function analysis was applied to predict the R curve behaviour of multilayer composites having a stepwise change in composition.

40|$|The {{current study}} focused on the surface {{integrity}} issues associated with broaching of Inconel 718 and the structural stability of the broached specimen at high temperatures, mainly involving the microstructural changes and residual stress relaxation. The broaching operation was performed using similar cutting conditions as that used in turbo machinery industries for machining fir-tree root fixings on turbine disks. Thermal exposure was conducted at 723 K, 823 K, and 923 K (450 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C) for 30, 300, and 3000 hours, respectively. Surface cavities and debris dragging, sub-surface cracks, high intensity of plastic deformation, {{as well as the}} generation of tensile residual stresses were identified to be the main issues in surface integrity for the broached Inconel 718. When a subsequent heating was applied, surface recrystallization and α-Cr precipitation occurred beneath the broached surface depending on the applied temperature and exposure time. The plastic deformation induced by the broaching is responsible for these microstructural changes. The surface tension was completely relaxed in a short time at the temperature where surface recrystallization occurred. The <b>tensile</b> <b>layer</b> on the sub-surface, however, exhibited a much higher resistance to the stress relief annealing. Oxidation is inevitable at high temperatures.

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy of cross-section specimens and high-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses {{have been applied}} to investigate the formation of defects and the relaxation of layer strain in step-graded GaPxAs 1 −x and GaNyAs 1 −y buffer layer systems grown by metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy on GaAs (001) substrates with 6 ° miscut towards (111) A. The investigations have been complemented by characterization of the layer surfaces employing optical microscopy. The comparison of the different buffer concepts reveals characteristic differences {{in the formation of}} defects and in the relaxation of <b>tensile</b> <b>layer</b> strain. For GaPAs layers dislocations and microtwins form, releasing the major part of the tensile misfit strain. In contrast, for GaNAs dislocations and microtwins are largely absent, at least in {{the upper part of the}} buffer structure, and microcracks are generated. Consequently, during subsequent growth of layers with tensile strain, strain relaxation and defect formation can be effectively hindered by introducing intermediate GaNyAs 1 −y layers with concentrations y > 2 % into a GaAs 1 −xPx buffer structure [1]. A similar concept can be used for layer systems with compressive strain, however, modified by using layers of differing alloy composition. The use of dilute nitride layers appears to offer a new concept for engineering defect distributions and layer strain in lattice-mismatched compound semiconductor layer structures. Such concepts are of particular interest not only but especially also for applications in high-efficiency III-V solar cells...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{flexible}} risers in service {{do not meet}} their documented service life. A common failure mode is the rupture of the abrasive external layer which, in itself, is not critical, but seawater ingress may corrode tensile wires over time and, in worst case, cause breakage. Damaged tensile armour could significantly reduce the load capacity of the riser. Integrity assessment of flexible riser with damaged tensile armour based on stress concentration factors (SCF) could predict the remaining fatigue life of the structure. SCF could be based on experimental tests, but they are expensive. Finite element analyses can be used instead {{at a much lower}} cost. In this thesis, three finite element models are created in Abaqus to replicate a 2. 5 inch flexible riser. In the first model, the tensile wires are represented by beam elements and the other layers by shell elements. In the second and third model, the tensile wires are represented by solid elements and the other layers are represented by shell and solid elements, respectively. However, only the two last models are used in the analyses. To reduce simulation time, the carcass and pressure armour are modelled in a simplified manner with equivalent material properties. A convergence study is performed to find the minimum element size needed to yield good results. The equivalent material properties used in the simplified layers are evaluated by comparing the hoop stress to analytical values which are in good agreement. Two load cases are considered in the stress analyses, where one is tension and the other is bending. The models are verified by comparing the axial stiffness to the physical one and axial wire stress due to bending to analytical values found in the literature. Both are in good agreement. A simulation is performed for the second model with two ruptured wires in the outer <b>tensile</b> <b>layer.</b> A tress concentration factor is established based on the current stress results for the mean axial wire stress.

40|$|Inconel 718 is a nickel-based {{superalloy}} that is extensively {{used as a}} disc material in gas turbine engines. The service life of gas turbine discs is normally governed by the modes of material degradation and fatigue failure since they work mostly at high temperatures and are subjected to cyclic mechanical loadings. Fatigue failures often start with the initiation of cracks at the surface and the precise details of the failure process significantly depend on the surface conditions. In turbine disc production, {{one of the last}} manufacturing steps is to broach root fixings, commonly of fir-tree design, for blade mounting. It has always been a challenge when machining Inconel 718 due to its high strength retention at elevated temperatures, rapid work hardening, as well as low thermal conductivity. This usually leads to rapid tool wear, and consequently shorter tool life, and at the end to the deterioration of the surface integrity of the machined components. The aim of this licentiate thesis is to increase our knowledge about the surface integrity, especially microstructure and residual stresses, of broached Inconel 718 and its stability under thermal exposure. This knowledge can later be used for analyzing the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks in broached Inconel 718, particularly in the case of high temperature fatigue, thereby giving {{a better understanding of the}} failure mechanism of gas turbine discs from a fatigue point of view. A broaching operation has been performed using similar cutting conditions as that used in turbo machinery industries for producing fir-tree root fixings. In addition, service damages were analyzed in a retired dis of Inconel 718. Surface defects, severe plastic deformation and generation of high tensile residual stresses have been found to be the main damages to the surface integrity caused by the broaching operation. The machining induced plastic deformation was found to accelerate the microstructural degradation beneath the broached surface when subjected to thermal exposure. The surface tensile residual stresses can be completely removed after short thermal exposure, the <b>tensile</b> <b>layer</b> in the sub-surface region, however, exhibited a high resistance to stress relief at high temperatures. The damage analysis on the retired disc indicated that presence of the highly deformed layer on the machined surface is negative for preventing the occurrence of fretting fatigue in turbine discs...|$|E

40|$|Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{experience}} a much shorter fatigue life than continuous rail sections, especially IRJs located in heavy haul rail corridors. IRJs {{are one of}} the most critical components of the rail system since their failure can lead to multiple catastrophic consequences, including; malfunctioning of the track signalling system due to metal contact across the insulating rail gap and, in cases where joints are damaged at the fishplate or rail bolt holes, derailment of railway vehicles. A literature review on the topic revealed that these joints suffer from a wide range of damage, predominately resulting from either the gradual accumulation of metal under plastic flow across the railhead in the vicinity of the rail end post, or rail end spalling and/or rail end post insulation damage. Other failure modes relate to problems with fishplates/joint bar and rail bolt holes. These include: fishplate cracking, delamination of fishplates, bolt looseness and bolt hole cracking. Therefore, IRJs are regarded as high-risk component and are maintained via expensive maintenance programs requiring high standards. Every year rail operators around Australia and the world install tens of thousands of rail joints, due to their early failure, or the risk of failure of either the signalling system and/or the structural track integrity. For the Australian heavy haul rail industry, the economic costs of IRJ maintenance are very high. In this study, approaches to both advanced characterisation of IRJ damage and to improving IRJs service lifetimes were investigated. Damage accumulation in the vicinity of the joint was characterised by advanced metallographic (optical microscopy, SEM and TEM) and neutron diffraction techniques. In the early stage of the project, surface hard facing was selected as a potential approach to improving IRJ lifetimes, and surface clad rail samples were produced and studied via simulation testing and testing of ex-service rails. The initial hard facing experiments involved comparison of the performance of ex-service laser clad IRJ samples (431 stainless steel cladding produced by Jarvie Engineering Private Limited) with that of uncoated IRJ samples manufactured from normal head hardened 60 kg grade rail. The results indicated IRJ lifetimes can be improved by a hard facing of rail ends. Follow-up investigations were performed using both robots TIG MMAW hard facing deposition approach, and experimentation with a choice of cladding metal and geometry of the hard-face rail surface. Experimentation included advanced metallography and electron microscopy, and limited wear testing of cladding materials. Full-scale wheel on track rig testing was also performed on both coated and uncoated samples, which involves cyclic rolling contact loading on railhead surface was the main objective to investigate the railhead damage. It was concluded that ferritic type commercial hard facing alloys, and maraging steels, appear good candidate materials for hard facing by weld deposition in the vicinity of IRJs. They also appear more suitable than the initial 431 stainless steel used in the laser cladding experiments as deleterious effects of thermal contraction during cooling are less in the ferritic alloys. It was also concluded and that geometry of the hard facing profile should include a steep angle of hard facing with the rail surface where it intersects the top surface of the rail head. Neutron diffraction analysis of ex-service IRJs revealed significant stress evolution in the vicinity of the top surfaces of the rail ends abutting the insulating gap. This distribution is characterised by a compressive layer of approximately 5 mm deep and a counterbalanced <b>tensile</b> <b>layer</b> located 5 - 15 mm at the sub-surface region. It exceeded the distribution along the continuous rail. Residual stresses analysis for the laboratory rig tested rail ends revealed similar characteristic to those found in ex-service rail ends. However, in contrast to the ex-service rail ends, the stress distributions in the test rig samples were slightly different and this difference was attributed to the localization of wheel load under the particular test conditions. A separate neutron diffraction examination of residual stresses near bolt-holes across ex-service IRJ fishplates revealed a stress evolution characterised by both compressive and tensile stresses, extended in a 900 and 450 angles to the longitudinal plane. The later results were consistent with a common observation of fishplate fracture originating at bolt holes at 450 to the running rail surface...|$|E

We construct a direct elastic analysis, {{from which we}} determine the elastic state of the system recursively {{in terms of that}} of the old states of the buried layers. In turn, we use the result for the elastic state to derive the morphological evolution equation of surface profile to first order of perturbations, with the solution explicitly expressed by the growth conditions and material parameters of all the deposited layers. We apply these results to two kinds of multilayer structures. One is the alternating tensile/compressive multilayer structure, for which we determine the effective stability properties, including the effect of varying surface mobility in different layers, its interplay with the global misfit of the multilayer film, and the influence of asymmetric structure of compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>layers</b> on the system stability. The nature of the asymmetry properties found in stability diagrams is in agreement with experimental observations.

40|$|AbstractThis {{contribution}} {{gives an}} overview of different fracture-mechanics issues occurring in layered ceramics designed with internal compressive residual stresses (such as the edge cracking, crack arrest by the compressive layer or crack deflection/bifurcation) and proposes an effective approach to describe the initiation and/or propagation of cracks in such materials. The finite fracture mechanics (FFM) theory and the coupled stress-energy criterion (CC) are discussed and applied to understand their fracture behavior. The stress-energy coupled criterion {{is based on the}} tensile strength and toughness data of investigated material and it does not contain any adjustable parameter, which is its indisputable advantage. It could thus (in the considered brittle materials) predict both crack initiation and crack propagation under consideration of both thermal and external mechanical loading. A case study is investigated, where edge cracking in compressive layers can be predicted {{as a function of the}} thickness of the compressive layer and the magnitude of residual stresses. Another case study concerns the onset of a crack in a notched sample of a layered ceramic submitted to bending. The propagation of the crack through the ceramic laminate is studied as a function of the volume ratio of particular material components and corresponding magnitude of residual stresses in both compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>layers.</b> Under certain combination of residual stress and layered architecture, the CC predicts crack arrest in the internal compressive layer of the laminate in accordance with experimental observations under similar loading conditions...|$|R

The general riser design consists of an internal carcass for collapse resistance, a polymer fluid barrier, carbon steel interlocked circumferential pressure armour layer for resisting internal pressure loads, helically wound carbon steel <b>tensile</b> armour <b>layers</b> to resist axial loads and a watertight external sheath. Much of the analytical work that {{has been carried out}} on flexible composite pipe is based on the early stress analyses of wire ropes, and this is primarily because of the helical geometry of many of the metallic elements such as pressure armour and <b>tensile</b> armour <b>layers</b> of a flexible riser. The general design philosophy of the layer is defined in API 17 J (American Petroleum Institute) in terms of the stress "utilisation" factor that specifies the maximum allowable average hoop stress in the layer, which is conventionally produced by the elastic stress analysis. The layers are subjected to severe cyclic bending and twisting deformation during manufacturing of the pipe which makes the material to exceed the yield point. Consequently, residual stresses are developed in the pipe material and variable amounts of non zero stresses exist in the metallic layers of the newly manufactured pipes. An attempt has been made to model the amount of residual stress evolved during manufacturing stage for two different metallic layers, namely; pressure armour and <b>tensile</b> armour <b>layers</b> and its effects on overall pipe's performance while in service. The strategy is to apply the finite element (FE) method by creating a 3 dimensional wire model of the segment of pipe. Solid structural elements with plasticity were employed for the analyses. Kinematic hardening with Baushinger effect, contact and friction effects were also taken into account. Precise boundary conditions were applied to the model for elastic-plastic bending. The resulting residual stresses have been transferred to 3 D axisymmetric model to investigate the internal and external pressure effects. This new procedure was carried out for both layers satisfying equilibrium and compatibility conditions for the pressure and tensile armours to find the common interface pressure and contact loading.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} bachelor's thesis defines the basic properties, categorization, {{and use of the}} individual components of concrete and presents the properties of fresh and hardened concrete, especially the tensile strength. Furthermore, the thesis addresses the problem of durability assessment of concrete, which depends directly {{on the quality of the}} surface layer. The experimental part of the thesis focuses on executing of a pull-off test and examines the surface <b>layer</b> <b>tensile</b> strengths of various concrete mix designs. The thesis examines how the results of the measurements correspond with other published results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceZnOGa" 2 O" 3 alloys {{have been}} {{deposited}} by electron beam co-evaporation technique below the piezoelectric radio frequency magnetron sputtered ZnO films, {{with the aim}} of reducing the compressive stress due to the piezoelectric zinc oxide elaborated by radio frequency magnetron technique. The structural characterizations of the Ga" 2 O" 3 thin films show an amorphous structure. Co-evaporating gallium oxide with zinc oxide has improved the optical and structural qualities of the e-beam zinc oxide films. Thus, deposing compressive rf magnetron sputtered piezoelectric ZnO on <b>tensile</b> thin <b>layers</b> of ZnOGa" 2 O" 3, has reduced the stress and improved the structural quality of the realized bulk acoustic wave resonators. The fabrication of less stressed ZnO resonators has permitted to liberate partially our membranes by attacking the silicon substrate on which the resonator is realized. Finally, hyper frequency characterizations have been done by a network analyzer to study the influence of the silicon substrate thickness on the piezoelectric activity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study bilayer patch of {{benzydamine}} HCl was developed using solvent casting method. Different substrates were attempted like Petri dish, glass-and-ring, and teflon-and-ring for selection of the proper option to formulate patch that should give easily peelable film with adequate mechanical properties. HPMC E 15 LV was used in different concentrations for obtaining proper viscosity of solution for pouring on to surface and ring, {{that it should not}} leak from ring. The second layer was optimized by using different polymer like eudragit RSPO, eudragit RSPO + EC, and eudragit NE 30 D for efficient layer bonding. The minimum release from backing membrane was established by diffusion study as compared to from drug loaded layer. The optimized batches were evaluated for folding endurance, weight variation, thickness, drug content, drug release, <b>tensile</b> strength, <b>layer</b> separation, mucoadhesion, moisture uptake, and layer bonding. The novel gingival patch of benzydamine HCl developed would be beneficial in optimizing the therapy...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. The Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM™) process owes its popularity to its hardware versatility, low cost and wide range of materials (and colours) available. In this study, PEEK was produced with 1 % and 5 % carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and processed in a modified FDM system able to operate with high temperature polymers. The <b>tensile</b> strength, <b>layer</b> bonding and microstructure of the plain and CNT loaded PEEK samples were investigated throughout the three steps of manufacturing: compounded composite feedstock filaments, single FDM deposited layers and fabricated test specimens. Interestingly, every step of processing seems to fabricate structures of lower performance. As part of the characterisation of the FDM structures, short shear beam tests were used as a new method to assess layer-to-layer bonding. This work {{was supported by the}} Centre for Defence Enterprise CDE 36453...|$|R
40|$|Natural and {{man-made}} brittle layers {{embedded in}} a weaker matrix and subjected to layer-parallel extension typically develop an array of opening-mode fractures with a remarkably regular spacing. This spacing often scales with layer thickness, and it decreases as extension increases until fracture saturation is reached. Existing analytical one-dimensional (1 -D) 2 ̆ 7 full-slip 2 ̆ 7 models, which assume that interfacial slip occurs over {{the entire length of}} the fracture-bound blocks, predict that the ratio of fracture spacing to layer thickness at saturation is proportional to the ratio of <b>layer</b> <b>tensile</b> to interface shear strength (T/s). Using 2 -D discontinuum mechanical models run for conditions appropriate to layered rocks, we show that fracture spacing at saturation decreases linearly with decreasing T/s ratio, as predicted by 1 -D models. At low T/s ratios (ca. < 3. 0), however, interfacial slip is suppressed and the heterogeneous 2 -D stress distribution within fracture-bound blocks controls further fracture nucleation, as predicted by an existing 2 -D 2 ̆ 7 fracture infill criterion 2 ̆ 7. The applicability of the two theories is hence T/s ratio dependent. Our models illustrate that fracture spacing in systems permitting interfacial slip is not necessarily an indicator of fracture system maturity. Fracture spacing is expected to decrease with increasing overburden pressure and decreasing <b>layer</b> <b>tensile</b> strength...|$|R
40|$|The strain {{behavior}} in nanoscale patterned biaxial <b>tensile</b> strained Si <b>layer</b> on insulator is investigated in 60 -nm-thick nanostructures with dimensions in the 80 - 400 nm range. The in-plane strain is evaluated by using UV micro-Raman. We found {{that less than}} 30 % of the biaxial strain is maintained in the 200 x 200 nm(2) nanostructures. This relaxation, due {{to the formation of}} free surfaces, becomes more important in smaller nanostructures. The strain is completely relieved at 80 nm. This phenomenon is described based on detailed three-dimensional finite element simulations. The anisotropic relaxation in rectangular nanostructures is also discussed...|$|R
