25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room,</b> Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

The Golden Bed and the Vita Nuova Washstand designed for this room are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held in <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper {{took place in a}} triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E

[...] Coretta suggested that the two women {{get out of the}} front room and went into <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room,</b> as the house was disturbed by an explosion which caused the house to rock and fill the front room with smoke and shattered glass. The two went {{to the rear of the}} home, where Yolanda was sleeping and Coretta called the First Baptist Church and reported the bombing to the woman who answered the phone. Martin returned to their home, and upon finding Coretta and his daughter unharmed, went outside. He was confronted by an angry crowd of his supporters, who had brought guns. He was able to turn them away with an impromptu speech.|$|E
2500|$|Recurrent {{humor is}} {{generated}} {{on the show}} by contrasting the 'squeaky-clean' habits of June and Ward with the 'grubby' ones of Wally and Beaver. While Ward and June stress cleanliness, bathing, and good grooming (ordering both boys to wash their faces, hands, and fingernails before dinner), both boys generally prefer being unwashed and dressed in dirty clothes. In the premiere episode, Wally and Beaver fake bathing by rumpling towels and tossing [...] "turtle dirt" [...] in the bathtub. In [...] "Cleaning Up Beaver", June and Ward commend Wally on his neat appearance and chide Beaver for his untidiness. When Wally calls Beaver a [...] "pig", Beaver moves into <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> where he can be his own dirty, messy self without comment or criticism from others. Frightening shadows in the room force {{him back to his}} old bedroom and the safety of being with his brother. The two boys strike a middle ground: Beaver will be a bit tidier than he usually is and Wally will be a bit sloppier.|$|E

60|$|There is a {{touch of}} pathos in this parting {{acquiescence}} in fate. If it must be so, indeed!
