5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none.</b> Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E

25|$|Early in the 20th century, a {{cache of}} texts {{was found in a}} mound near Gilgit in Pakistan. Amongst them was the Ajitasena Sūtra. This sutra appears to be a mixture of Mahayana and pre-Mahayana ideas. The text is set in a world where monasticism is the norm, typical of the Pāli Suttas; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> of the usual {{antagonism}} towards the śravakas (i.e., the early Buddhists) or the notion of Arahantship, as is typical of Mahayana sutras such as the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating, {{begun in}} 1995 by {{physicist}} Douglass Donahue and chemists Jacqueline Olin and Garman Harbottle, places {{the origin of}} the parchment somewhere between 1423 and 1445. The initial results were confusing because the unknown substance the British Museum had found across the whole map, effectively ignored by later researchers who were concentrating on the ink, turned out to be trapping tiny traces of fallout deep within the parchment from 1950s nuclear tests. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> of this 1950s substance on top of the ink, further tests, starting with a detailed chemical analysis, are needed to confirm whether the lines were drawn after it soaked into the parchment.|$|E
5000|$|Sixth Dynasty (2345-2181 BCE) tomb artwork in Egypt {{has been}} {{thought to be}} the oldest {{documentary}} evidence of circumcision, the most ancient depiction being a bas-relief from the necropolis at Saqqara (c. 2400 BCE) with the inscriptions reading: [...] "The ointment is to make it acceptable." [...] and [...] "Hold him so that he does not fall". In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century BCE, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: [...] "When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men ... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who hit out, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> hit, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who scratched and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> scratched." ...|$|R

25|$|Airfields were {{constructed}} by prisoner of wars and conscripted labour from various locations, including from Brunei, Maeda-shima, Ranau and Elopura. Before the Japanese occupation, {{there were only}} three airfields in Kuching, Miri and Bintulu of Sarawak, while in North Borneo <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none.</b> Due to this, the Japanese planned to construct a total of twelve airfields in different parts of northern Borneo to strengthen its defence, of which seven will be located in Api, Elopura, Keningau, Kudat, Tawau, Maeda-shima and Lahad Datu. The Japanese also launched a series of trunk road projects in North Borneo, where the roads between Ranau with Keningau and Kota Belud with Tenghilan will be improved as well a new road linking Kudat and Kota Belud will be constructed. As these roads passed through a wide mountainous areas, large number of rōmusha are needed to realise the projects.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{original}} mural work that covered the walls and ceilings are deteriorated or lost, but reconstructed murals {{have been added to}} parts, especially in the spaces between the nerves of the vaults. These murals contain soft colors which form lines, geometrical shapes and floral shapes reminiscent of ironwork. These probably date to the last third of the 19th century but this is mostly conjecture. The side walls contain faded remnants of narrative scenes, which have not been dated either. One of the best conserved elements inside the church is the 16th century pulpit, made of sandstone sculpted with fine Gothic style designs. In each of the faces of the design, anagrams of the name of Christ or the coat of arms of the Augustinians appear. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> like it from all of the Mexican colonial period. The original confession booths are built into the wall on the right hand side of the nave, separating the church and the cloister, with the priest entering one side and the confessor entering through the other. They were covered up for much of the church’s history until 1954, when Father Jose Maria Mendez moved the altars on this wall to reveal them. Between them and the baptistery area, there is a large door that leads to the cloister of the former monastery. In colonial times, this door was only opened for Mass on major festivals.|$|E

[...] The pair {{set out to find}} a Russian submarine—and find one, but Nelson mistakes it for a monster to be subdued with his speargun.

500|$|Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter {{writes in}} Secret Gardens The Golden Age of Children's Literature that Potter's work shows {{thematic}} shifts, seeing in The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle a utopian theme of nature-as-redemption {{in which the}} background represents a return to Arcadia of sorts. Young Lucy finds in Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's kitchen a place of refuge, and although unlike Potter's previous stories the main character is unthreatened by other characters or external circumstances, Carpenter writes [...] "while no external threat enters this most utopian of Potter's books, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> the less something faintly sinister about Mrs. Tiggy-winkle herself".|$|E
500|$|Tynan, {{who could}} be brutally {{critical}} when he thought Richardson miscast, nevertheless thought there was something godlike about him, [...] "should you imagine the Almighty to be a whimsical, enigmatic magician, capable of fearful blunders, sometimes inexplicably ferocious, at other times dazzling in his innocence and benignity". Harold Hobson wrote, [...] "Sir Ralph is an actor who, whatever his failure in heroic parts, however short of tragic grandeur his Othello or his Macbeth may have fallen, has nevertheless, in unromantic tweeds and provincial hats, received a revelation. There are more graceful players than he upon the stage; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> who has been so touched by Grace." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1898, Armin Otto Leuschner was {{appointed}} {{the director of}} the Students' Observatory, a post that he held until his retirement in 1938. During this time, [...] "the observatory became a center for the computation of the orbits of comets, minor planets, and satellites." [...] Astronomer Simon Newcomb said that Leuschner organized the department and observatory into [...] "a thorough school of astronomy, than which [...] <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> better." [...] After he stepped down, the observatory was directed by a series of well regarded astronomers, including Otto Struve from 1950–59 and Louis G. Henyey from 1959–64. The Students' Observatory was renamed Leuschner Observatory by the Regents of the University of California in 1951 in honor of A. O. Leuschner. The Space Sciences Lab, which operates SETI, began operations in 1960 at Leuschner Observatory until a permanent home in the Berkeley hills was completed in 1966.|$|E

In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century B.C, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: [...] "When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men...there <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who hit out, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> hit, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who scratched and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> scratched." ...|$|R

According to the Atlanta Constitution, [...] "Doc Kuhn, {{in winning the}} Porter Cup, has taken the last leaf in the laurel. Offered each year by the Porter Clothing company, the trophy has risen in distinction from a mere silver emblem to a symbol more highly prized than which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> to offer to a Vanderbilt athlete". Kuhn was also captain of the basketball team, president of the student council, president of Phi Kappa Psi and Hellenic president. The Atlanta Journal said, [...] "Doc Kuhn is captain and president of everything at Vanderbilt but the co-eds". The only two football games he lost at Vanderbilt were in 1923, to undefeated teams: national champion Michigan and the Texas Longhorns. The Commodores were Southern Conference (SoCon) co-champion in 1923, with two All-Southern ends–Lynn Bomar and Hek Wakefield, and All-Southern halfback Gil Reese.|$|E
500|$|López {{is perhaps}} best known for his role as the setup {{reliever}} for the Tigers during their 1984 championship season, when he finished with a 101 record, 14 saves, and a 2.94 ERA. López had a 10 record in both the 1984 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and 1984 World Series, and he did not give up an earned run in over six innings pitched that postseason. He faced seven batters in Game Five of the 1984 World Series, retiring them all. After the pitcher got out of two extra-inning jams to earn a 1984 ALCS win, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson said, [...] "Nothing surprises me about Lopez. I've had him for five years and believe me, there's nothing like him. He's got heart and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> better. He's one of the all-time hearts." [...] While in Detroit, López had earned the nickname [...] "Señor Smoke", as he hailed from Mexico and threw a powerful fastball.|$|E
500|$|An early {{draft of}} the script {{attributed}} to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house {{in the guise of}} Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish for her brother to be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this {{draft of the}} script, and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would [...] "much rather have a Queen" [...] than [...] "a little goblin prince." [...] The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, her blows causing him to transform into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas in the film she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas in the film <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> (although there is in the novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualized.|$|E

500|$|Boulton helped {{deal with}} the {{shortage}} of silver, persuading the Government to let him overstrike the Bank of England's large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design. [...] The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, {{in part due to}} counterfeiting. This attempt inspired the couplet, [...] "The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass." [...] Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking. Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped (high quality fakes arrived at the Bank's offices within days of the issuance), these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816, when Boulton's were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland. Even as his health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint, and he sat and watched the machinery,which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90,000,000 pieces for the East India Company. [...] He wrote, [...] "Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered upon, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>none</b> in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of bringing to perfection the art of coining." ...|$|E
