5|$|In 1929, Edward Bernays helped <b>the</b> <b>Lucky</b> Strike {{cigarette}} brand {{increase its}} sales among the female demographic. Research showed {{that women were}} reluctant to carry a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, because the brand's green color scheme clashed with popular fashion choices. Bernays persuaded fashion designers, charity events, interior designers and others to popularize the color green. He also positioned cigarettes as Torches of Freedom that represent rebellion against the norms of a male-dominated society.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} portrayed Madonna dancing {{in front of}} a white background, {{accompanied}} by her dancers. After the video was released, Madonna's style and mannerisms became a fashion trend among the younger generation. Scholars noted that in the video, Madonna portrayed herself as narcissistic and an ambiguous character. She referred to herself as <b>the</b> <b>lucky</b> star, unlike the lyrical meaning of the song. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, most recently at the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). It has also been covered by a number of artists.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was originally}} in the highway median at the Toronto terminus of the highway, {{dedicated to the}} 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as <b>the</b> <b>Lucky</b> Lion. The column, with a crown {{at the top and}} a lion at the base, was designed by W. L. Somerville and sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle for C$12,000 (in 1940, $ adjusted for inflation). The monument was removed in 1972 in order to accommodate widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir Casimir Gzowski Park along Lake Ontario, {{on the east side of}} the Humber River.|$|E

Singer Stuart Staples started <b>the</b> <b>Lucky</b> Dog record label and released his debut solo album, Lucky Dog Recordings 03–04, in 2005 and the Leaving Songs album in 2006, while violinist Dickon Hinchcliffe recorded the score to the 2005 Ira Sachs film Forty Shades of Blue.

The pair, along with Sammo Hung, were Peking Opera School classmates and co-starred {{in a number of}} action comedy films in the 1980s, including Project A, Wheels on Meals, and <b>the</b> <b>Lucky</b> Stars trilogy. Chan had originally intended to co-star with both Yuen and Hung, reuniting the trio {{for the first time since}} 1988 film Dragons Forever. However, Hung declined due to a scheduling conflicts. Yuen Biao plays the role of Police Inspector Steve Mok, assigned to investigate the baby's disappearance. Some of Yuen's past antics were revisited in Rob-B-Hood, including a fight in which he tried in vain to handcuff Chan's character.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lucky</b> Shot is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot is follows Jack Hunt, {{the son of a}} wealthy woman, who weds a chorus singer Nell Horsley. Jack's mother forgives the son's error, but rejects his wife. Then Jack is killed while on strike duty in the local militia and the Nell and her child struggle in poverty. Nell begs her mother-in-law for aid, but the woman is enraged and drops dead.

5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. <b>The</b> <b>Lucky</b> Dragon incident had {{touched off a}} storm of protest, and there were calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E

5|$|Utopia was Carte's most {{expensive}} production to date, but it {{ran for a}} comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894. Carte then played first Mirette, composed by André Messager, then The Chieftain, by F. C. Burnand and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively. The company then toured the London suburbs, and the theatre was dark {{during the summer of}} 1895, reopening in November for a revival of The Mikado. This was followed in 1896 by The Grand Duke, which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. The Gondoliers turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after The Grand Duke, the two men never collaborated again. At the Savoy, Carte produced His Majesty (1897), The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (1897), The Beauty Stone (1898) and <b>The</b> <b>Lucky</b> Star (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose aspect to labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack Hunt is killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues in The Girls of the Ghetto, another July 1910 release. The plot of <b>The</b> <b>Lucky</b> Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their house would be reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the little boy and Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E
