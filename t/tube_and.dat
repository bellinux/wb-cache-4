If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person {{may not be able to}} breathe without the help of an endotracheal <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> mechanical ventilator.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E

5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E
5|$|Train {{frequencies}} {{are primarily}} {{limited by the}} fact that most lines funnel into the Transbay <b>Tube</b> <b>and</b> San Francisco. While a small sections of track in Oakland, Colma, and Daly City are triple- and quadruple-tracked, there are few sidings which would allow limited-stop or express trains to pass others.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Gibb was {{appointed}} {{managing director of}} the UERL. At Gibb's invitation, Pick also moved to the UERL to continue working as his assistant. The UERL controlled the District Railway and, during 1906 and 1907, opened three deep-level tube lines – the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (Bakerloo tube), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (Hampstead <b>tube)</b> <b>and</b> the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Piccadilly tube).|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{flux leakage}} testing (MFL) {{is also used}} for {{nondestructive}} testing (NDT) of steel <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> pipes. At present RFT is more commonly used in small diameter <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> MFL in larger diameter pipes over long travel distances.|$|R

50|$|From the 1920s to the 1960s, {{virtually}} every electronic device used hot cathode vacuum tubes. Today, hot cathodes {{are used as}} the source of electrons in fluorescent lamps, vacuum <b>tubes,</b> <b>and</b> electron guns in cathode ray <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> laboratory equipment such as electron microscopes.|$|R
5|$|Nemerteans {{often have}} {{numerous}} temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down {{each side of}} the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and some of these are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.|$|E
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. Ticket {{prices were}} low and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly {{the result of}} competition between the UERL's lines {{and those of the}} other <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, also took a large number of passengers away from the trains.|$|E

The work covers the theoretical part of the time horizont of the oldest methods of bending to the present methods. In the theoretical part are given the most modern machines used to bend <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> profiles...|$|R
5|$|The UERL's three tube railway {{companies}} were still legally separate entities {{with their own}} management and shareholder and dividend structures. There was duplicated administration between the three companies and, to streamline the management and reduce expenditure, the UERL announced a bill in November 1909 that would merge the Hampstead Tube, the Piccadilly <b>Tube</b> <b>and</b> the Bakerloo Tube into a single entity, the London Electric Railway (LER), although the lines retained their own individual branding. The bill received assent on 26 July 1910 as the London Electric Railway Amalgamation Act, 1910.|$|E
5|$|The cannon {{appeared}} in 12th century China, probably as a parallel development or {{evolution of the}} fire-lance, a short ranged anti-personnel weapon combining a gunpowder-filled <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> a polearm of some kind. Co-viative projectiles such as iron scraps or porcelain shards were placed in fire lance barrels at some point, and eventually, the paper and bamboo materials of fire lance barrels were replaced replaced by metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) {{end of the}} tube, air rushes in to fill the slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up the tube (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{electrification}} of the DR, Yerkes {{did not live}} to see the completion of the fast-paced construction works that he set in motion; he died in New York on 29 December 1905 and was replaced as UERL chairman by Edgar Speyer. Speyer was chairman of the UERL's backer Speyer Brothers and a partner in Speyer & Co. Sir George Gibb, general manager of the North Eastern Railway, was appointed managing director. The BS opened to passengers on 10 March 1906. The GNP followed on 15 December 1906, with the CCE on 22 June 1907. The three tube lines quickly {{came to be known as}} the Bakerloo Tube, Piccadilly <b>Tube</b> <b>and</b> Hampstead Tube.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E

5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes {{it was a combination of}} an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E
5|$|In the DVD commentary, Matt Groening {{notes that}} {{beginning}} any television series is difficult, {{but he found}} particular difficulty starting one {{that took place in}} the future because of the amount of setup required. As a trade off, they included a lot of Easter eggs in the episode that would pay off in later episodes. He and Cohen point these out throughout the episode. The scene where Fry emerges from a cryonic <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> has his first view of New New York was the first 3D scene worked on by the animation team. It was considered to be a defining point for whether the technique would work or not.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} <b>tube,</b> <b>and</b> extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
