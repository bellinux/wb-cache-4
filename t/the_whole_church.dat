5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536, the north of England was convulsed {{in a series of}} uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious {{opposition}} to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the Ten Articles. The outcome after months of debate was The Institution of a Christian Man informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church.</b> Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Catholicism {{and several}} other Christian denominations, a Doctor of the Church is an eminent theologian (for example, Saint Thomas Aquinas, {{also known as the}} Angelic Doctor) from whose teachings <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> is held to have derived great advantage.|$|E

One prebend is reserved for the Archbishop of Dublin, an unusual arrangement which is only actively used for elections of the dean.|$|E

25|$|The north {{church has}} an unusual quincuncial (cross-in-square) plan, {{and was one}} of the first shrines in Constantinople to adopt this plan, whose {{prototype}} is possibly the Nea Ekklesia ("New Church"), erected in Constantinople in the year 880, of which no remains are extant. During the Ottoman period the four columns have been replaced with two pointed arches which span <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
25|$|Religious {{education}} of parishes {{are carried out}} by Sunday Schools, seminars, disciple training courses and catechism class, among others. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> relies on the Religious Education and Resource Centre to co-ordinate religious education research, provision of religious education curriculum and promotion of religious education. Besides training ordinands, Ming Hua Theological College also provides multi-faceted theological, spiritual and biblical studies for laity.|$|E
25|$|The 1990s saw the {{beginning}} of piecemeal efforts to restore the church. Another city historian, Kevin Barrett, called for the building's preservation in 1994, and the Council on the Arts intensified its efforts. It was suggested that the city or private donors restore {{one of the original}} columns, as a way of demonstrating that the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church,</b> though a considerable task, was not impossible.|$|E

50|$|The London Blitz {{destroyed}} the chancel roof and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church's</b> stained glass in 1941, {{along with other}} damage, but repairs were immediate and a permanent restoration of the nave was complete by the war's end, followed by a more comprehensive restorations in 1950 and 1965-1966. It now forms part of the East Ham Team Parish (also known as the Parish of the Holy Trinity) alongside St Edmund's, St Bartholomew's and St Alban's.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> 14th-century <b>church</b> survives, {{with its}} {{interior}} enhanced in the 17th century, and restoration by Charles Edward Ponting in 1888-91. It {{was listed as}} Grade I in 1968.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not merely}} by the title of example that we cherish the memory of those in heaven; we seek, rather, that by this devotion to the {{exercise}} of fraternal charity the union of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> in the Spirit may be strengthened. Exactly as Christian communion among our fellow pilgrims brings us closer to Christ, so our communion with the saints joins us to Christ.|$|E
25|$|The church holds {{services}} on Sunday mornings and Tuesday evenings. Both Sunday services are Holy Eucharist, {{with the earlier}} one held in the chapel with a purely spoken liturgy and the later service using <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church</b> and music. Both use Rite Two from the Book of Common Prayer. Sunday school is also offered during that time. Tuesday's Eucharist and Intercessions service is often led {{by members of the}} congregation.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of Valtorta argue that, {{according}} to canon law, the Roman Pontiff has full power over <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church,</b> hence the initial approval given by Pope Pius XII effectively nullified any subsequent {{ruling by the}} Holy Office, including the Holy Office's action under his own reign and its later condemnation {{of the work and}} placing it on the Index, even with the approval of Pope John XXIII, in 1960.|$|E

25|$|The chancel is {{the oldest}} part of the church, its walls being those of the {{original}} building, the 13th century niches, piscina and aumbry. The tower is 14th century, with massive diagonal buttresses and eight bells dated between 1627 and the 19th century. The porch is restored but {{is believed to be}} 15th century. The north aisle was built in 1827, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church</b> was subject to a major restoration in 1868.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the infallibility of ecumenical councils states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, approved by the Pope, which concern faith or morals, and to which <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees are often labeled as canons, and they often have an attached anathema, a penalty of excommunication, against those who refuse to believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is infallible.|$|E
25|$|A motu proprio is a {{document}} {{issued by the}} Pope on his own initiative and personally signed by him. A motu proprio may be addressed to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church,</b> to part of it, or to some individuals. A document issued motu proprio has its legal effect even if the reasons given for its issuance {{are found to be}} false or fraudulent, a fact which would normally render the document invalid. Its validity is based on its issuance by the pope by his own initiative, not upon the reasons alleged.|$|E
50|$|Under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, the Pope has supreme, full, {{immediate}} and universal ordinary authority in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Catholic <b>Church,</b> {{which he can}} always freely exercise, including the Eastern Catholic churches, and their leaders.|$|R
50|$|During {{the two and}} a {{half years}} of his patriarchate, Isidore sought to have <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Byzantine <b>Church</b> accept <b>the</b> Palamite dogmas. He {{selected}} bishops only from the Palamite party. He instituted harsh penalties for those who refused to submit.|$|R

25|$|Baroque Mariology was {{supported}} by several popes during the period: Pope Paul V and Gregory XV ruled in 1617 and 1622 to be inadmissible to state, that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. Alexander VII declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered {{the feast of the}} Immaculata for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> in 1708. The feast of the Rosary was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742.|$|E
25|$|The bishop or eparch of a see, {{even if he}} {{does not}} also hold a title such as Archbishop, Metropolitan, Major Archbishop, Patriarch or Pope, is the centre of unity for his diocese or eparchy, and, {{as a member of the}} College of Bishops, shares in {{responsibility}} for governance of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 886). As each local particular Church is an embodiment of the whole Catholic Church, not just an administrative subdivision of something larger, the bishop who is its head is not a delegate of the Pope. Instead, he has of himself primary teaching, governance and sanctifying responsibility for the see for which he has been ordained bishop.|$|E
25|$|Solemnityâ€”the {{highest ranking}} type of feast day. It commemorates {{an event in}} the life of Jesus or Mary, or celebrates a Saint {{important}} to <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> or the local community. The Mass of a solemnity has proper readings and prayers, the Gloria and Creed are recited, and occasionally there will be use of incense, a processional hymn and procession, and a recessional hymn/recession. Outside of Advent, Lent and Eastertide, a solemnity falling on a Sunday is celebrated in place of the Sunday. The equivalent type in the older Tridentine or Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite and the 1962 Missal of Pope St. John XXIII would be a I Class Feast.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of Vandal rule, Syracuse and the island was {{recovered}} by Belisarius for the Byzantine Empire (31 December 535). From 663 to 668 Syracuse was the seat of Emperor Constans II, as well as metropolis of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Sicilian <b>Church.</b>|$|R

25|$|The 2001 {{census of}} India {{recorded}} 24,080,016 Christians in the country, {{most of them}} belonging to the Latin Rite and represented 2.34 per cent of the population. A 2005 report by the Catholic church said that 17,300,000 baptised Catholics lived in the country, although it could not put a figure on {{how many of those}} were practising. 310,000 were members of the Syro-Malankara Church and 3,000,000 of the Syro-Malabar Church. In January 1993, the Syro-Malabar Church and in February 2005, the Syro-Malankara Church were raised to the status of major archiepiscopal churches by Pope John Paul II. The Syro-Malabar Church is the second largest among the twenty two Eastern Catholic Churches who accept the Pope as the visible head of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and the Master both try {{to appeal}} to Azal but for {{opposite}} reasons. The huge, devil-like figure decides to give his power to the Master, and fires electricity at the Doctor to kill him. However, Jo, steps {{in front of the}} Doctor, asking Azal to kill her instead. This act of self-sacrifice does not make sense to Azal, and sends him into a confused rage. The Doctor tells everyone to flee the Church. With Bok also rendered motionless, Azal erupts and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Church</b> is blown up. The Master tries to escape but is captured by the UNIT troops and taken away. The Doctor, Jo, Miss Hawthorne and the UNIT team join the villagers in their May Day celebrations.|$|E
25|$|Gothic {{architecture}} {{was brought}} to Portugal by the Cistercian Order. The first fully Gothic building in Portugal is {{the church of the}} Monastery of AlcobaÃ§a, a magnificent example of the clear and simple architectural forms favoured by the Cistercians. The church was built between 1178 and 1252 in three phases, and seems inspired by the Abbey of Clairvaux, in the Champagne. Its three aisles are very tall and slender, giving an exceptional impression of height. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>church</b> is covered by rib vaulting and the main chapel has an ambulatory and a series of radiant chapels. The vault of the ambulatory is externally supported by flying buttresses, typical features of Gothic architecture and a novelty at the time in Portugal.|$|E

60|$|I {{purposely}} {{abstain from}} extending these observations to any length. I {{have nothing to}} defend, or to explain away. The truth is the truth; and neither childish absurdities, nor unscrupulous contradictions, can make it otherwise. The earth would still move round the sun, though <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Catholic <b>Church</b> said No.|$|R
50|$|The Ecumenical Patriarch has {{no direct}} {{jurisdiction}} outside the Patriarchate of Constantinople granted {{to him in}} Orthodox canonical literature, but his primary function regarding <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Orthodox <b>Church</b> is one of dealing with relations between autocephalous and autonomous churches. That is, his primary role is one of promoting and sustaining Church unity.|$|R
