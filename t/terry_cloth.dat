5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{developmental}} homeostasis were demonstrated {{in an experiment}} conducted four decades ago by Margaret and Harry Harlow. They wanted to test what the consequences of infant rhesus monkeys would be from being separated from their mothers and having little interaction with other monkeys. First, they were separated from their mothers for six to twelve hours after birth and placed with a human made mechanical substitute in which they called the [...] "surrogate mother." [...] These surrogates were made of a wire cylinder structure and a <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> structure and were placed with the babies is a cage. The <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> structure was also placed with a nursing bottle. The monkeys preferred and clung to the cloth surrogate mother. In {{a short period of}} time the monkeys took on side effects of weight loss and not abnormal physical development. Once the monkeys reached an age where they could eat solid foods, they were separated from their cloth mothers for three days. When they were reunited with their mothers, they clung to them and did not wander off. Young rhesus monkeys in their natural habitat normally explore and venture off. Harlow concluded from this that the need for contact comfort was stronger than the need to explore. Being isolated from social interaction also caused negative outcomes later in their life. The surrogate-raised monkeys exhibited depression and aggressive behavior as they would clutch to themselves, rock constantly back and forth, and avoid interaction with others. Not only affecting their social behavior, it also impacted them interacting sexually. The monkeys underwent little if any sexual posturing or reproduction in their lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Tracksuits {{have come}} {{in and out of}} fashion over several decades. The first decade to feature {{tracksuits}} as sportswear that was acceptable to wear outside of the gym was the 1970s. Most likely the trend was influenced by the emergence of Bruce Lee (Game of Death) as a popular movie celebrity. Tracksuits first became popular around 1975, made out of cotton, polyester, <b>terry</b> <b>cloth,</b> or a mix. In the late 1970s velour became popular, so much so that it became the most used form of fabric on a tracksuit. The trend of wearing athletic clothing continued into the early 1980s. Tracksuits were eventually replaced by shellsuits, which were made out of nylon, in the late 1980s. This trend was short-lived, lasting only a few years.|$|E

The flair was in the details: low backs, {{criss-crossing}} straps, flared hips, discreet patterns. In 1934, the designer showed swimsuits worn under a matching skirt or flared shorts, giving women a new alternative to the fuller covering of an apron dress. With either option, a woman could simply slip on the skirt, shorts or dress over her swimsuit and go straight to lunch or jump into her car. An apron style sundress with a low back allowed women to soak up the sun's rays on the terrace of a restaurant. Pants got a cargo pocket and jackets incorporated pockets or deeply cuffed sleeves that could hold a swim cap or a wet bathing suit. The beach wear range grew to include sleeveless dresses with matching cotton coats and capri pants, oversized <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> lined jackets, high-waisted shorts and bra tops; with matching sandals, socks and beach bags.|$|E

Consumer opinions on preference of type of towels for aesthetic value were obtained. Chi Square statistical test was utilized for comparative analysis based on marital status, age, educational level, and family income. Fifty per cent of the respondents owned velour bath towels: of these 52 per cent rated velour towels as not very absorbent. All of the respondents owned <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> towels and 70 per cent of these rated <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> as very absorbent. The majority of the respondents who used fabric softeners stated the fabric softener made no difference in the absorbency of the towels. Velour towels were preferred for aesthetic value, but the overall preference was for the <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> towels. The laboratory investigation included weight, and wick-up tests.

40|$|In-vivo and ex-vivo {{evaluations}} of two prototype double velour tube grafts have been conducted. The experimental grafts were fabricated from <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> derivatives of the Dacron polyester {{material that is}} used in the construction of presently available Microvel® Double Velour and Cooley Double Velour Guideline® grafts. * The use of <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> derivatives in the experimental grafts provides a velour pile that is more uniform in height and density than current clinical grafts. The hypothesis examined by these studies was whether the utilization of <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> derivatives provides a more perfect capsular and luminal surface for fibrous tissue attachment and ingrowth, thereby enhancing neointimal formation at the blood contacting surface. Using standard techniques, prototype grafts were implanted in the abdominal aortas of dogs for test periods of 1 to 6 months. All grafts remained patent throughout the healing period. At explantation, the macroscopic and microscopic properties of the grafts were examined and characterized. Neointimal analysis demonstrated that the lighter denier, higher porosity prototype consistently produced more homogeneous blood-contacting surfaces with smoother contours and more complete endothelialization than the heavier denier, lower porosity prototype. From these analyses, we can conclude that both prototype grafts possess the basic properties of useful arterial prostheses. They are not prone to early thrombosis, and exhibit rapid healing properties. This study indicates that the use of <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> derivatives provides a more uniform, less random velour pile and that arterial grafts constructed from such materials produce more uniform and biologically stable neointimas...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of Salmonella typhimurium (V- 31) on wool blanket, wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, cotton <b>terry</b> <b>cloth,</b> and cotton wash-and-wear fabrics was studied. Three methods of exposure {{were employed to}} contaminate the fabrics: direct contact, aerosol, and a lyophilized mixture of bacteria and dust having a high content of textile fibers. After contamination, the fabrics were held in 35 or 78 % relative humidity at 25 C. The persistence time of S. typhimurium on fabrics held in 35 % relative humidity was substantially longer when the fabrics were contaminated by direct contact or by exposure to dust containing bacteria than when contaminated by exposure to aerosolized cultures. Viable bacterial populations persisted for 24 weeks at relatively high population densities on swatches of wool gabardine, cotton sheeting, cotton knit jersey, and cotton <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> exposed by direct contact and held in a humidity of 35 %. In 78 % humidity, bacterial populations persisted on the fabrics for relatively shorter periods of time regardless of the mode of contamination or fabric type.

We studied whether washing at 22 C would result in fabric-associated bacterial counts sig-nificantly different from those remaining after the high-temperature wash procedure in general use. Using a standard method to enumerate fabric-associated bacteria, we found that soiled sheets and <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> items were contaminated, respectively, with 106 and 108 cfu/l 00 cm 2 of fabric area, predominantly gram-negative rods (especially Enterobac-teriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae). Staphylococcus species were the most common gram-positive organisms. A standard low-temperature washing cycle without laundry chemicals removed 3 loglO of bacteria by agitation, dilution, and drainage. When low-temperature laundry chemicals were used, 3 10 glO of bacteria were killed after the bleach was added, and sheets and <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> items had postwash colony counts of 101 _ 102 cfu/ 100 cm 2 • Drying removed an additional 1 - 2 loglo organisms.

Little is known about exposure levels and possible remediation measures to reduce potential exposure in contaminated areas. This study deals with the effect of aging on THS components and evaluates possible exposure levels and remediation measures. We investigated the concentration of nicotine, five nicotine related alkaloids, and three tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in smoke exposed fabrics. Two different extraction methods were used. Cotton <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> and polyester fleece were exposed to smoke in controlled laboratory conditions and aged before extraction. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for chemical analysis. Fabrics aged for 19 months after smoke exposure retained significant amounts of THS chemicals. During aqueous extraction, cotton cloth released about 41 times as much nicotine and about 78 {{times the amount of}} tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) as polyester after one hour of aqueous extraction. Concentrations of nicotine and TSNAs in extracts of <b>terry</b> <b>cloth</b> exposed to smoke were used to estimate infant/toddler oral exposure and adult dermal exposure to THS. Nicotine exposure from THS residue can be 6. 8 times higher in toddlers and 24 times higher in adults and TSNA exposure can be 16 times higher in toddlers and 56 times higher in adults than what would be inhaled by a passive smoker.

30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that towelling (<b>terry</b> <b>cloth)</b> used for the {{fabrication}} of washcloths is a thick material, the uptake of both water and cleaning agent by the cloth is quite significant.

Otherwise, rather than detecting the new pH value, residues of the previous cleaning product will define the measured pH. In order to enable the parents or nursing staff to estimate the pH more accurately, a colour comparison chart may be used, but a yes–no decision may be sufficient, especially since there are predominantly two types of washing agents commercially available, either skin-friendly ones with a pH of around 5.5 or normal soaps with corresponding pH values around 9.|$|E
