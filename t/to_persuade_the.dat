5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E

5|$|A clay tablet {{found in}} ancient Iraq that {{promoted}} more advanced agricultural techniques is sometimes considered {{the first known}} example of public relations.

5|$|A {{government}} report released in November 1990 documented {{serious problems with}} the A-12 development program. In December 1990 Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney told the Navy to justify the program and deliver reasons why {{it should not be}} canceled.

50|$|In the Second World War, all shower valves for British {{military}} {{use were}} made by them. By 1950 the Leonard brand of shower equipment was becoming the main brand used for institutional buildings - schools and hospitals. This was due <b>to</b> <b>persuading</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Education to install temperature-regulated showers. The thermostatic mixing valves were not just used for showers but for general heating of water, including their thermostatic steam water heaters.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> Tsar {{to join in}} an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the king was {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|By 917, Simeon was {{preparing}} for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them.

5|$|It was {{determined}} that P. rebeli larvae use chemical mimicry <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> M. schencki ants that the P. rebeli {{are part of the}} ant brood. Furthermore, M. schencki ants cannot distinguish the physical differences between the P. rebeli larvae and other non-kin brood because the P. rebeli larvae are far more similar to the M. schencki larvae than to any other ant species larvae.|$|E
5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> jury to find him guilty.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes' initial {{response}} to the declaration of war was diplomatic; they asked the Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the Second Punic War having just ended. The Roman Senate attempted <b>to</b> <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side, {{but was unable to}} sway the city's war-weary population.|$|E
