50|$|Before the {{handover}} of Hong Kong, all {{the domestic}} <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets</b> installed were BS 6312 British <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets</b> {{but there was}} no stipulation on commercial <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets.</b> Both Registered Jack (RJ) and BS 6312 systems were (and are) found in commercial telephone installations.|$|R
50|$|The QL used British Telecom type 631W plugs (similar to British <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets)</b> for serial cables {{except for}} QLs built by Samsung for export markets, which had DE-9 sockets. Joysticks {{connected}} to the QL with similar type 630W plugs.|$|R
50|$|British <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets</b> were {{introduced}} in their current plug and socket form on 19 November 1981 by British Telecom to allow subscribers to connect their own telephones. The connectors are specified in British Standard BS 6312. Electrical characteristics of the telephone interface are specified by individual network operators, e.g. in British Telecom's SIN 351. Electrical characteristics required of British telephones used to be specified in BS 6305.|$|R
50|$|There exists no well {{established}} standard in which polarity pins 2 and 5 {{of the phone}} socket are connected to pins 4 and 5 of the 8P8C connector; both alternatives are common. This polarity is not important; e.g. BT also no longer specifies in which polarity the A and B wires are connected to pins 2 and 5 of their master <b>telephone</b> <b>socket,</b> although earlier standards specified that the A wire be connected to 5 and the B wire to 2.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} only one socket in a house or apartment, the {{incoming}} line is connected to the two lower receptacles and the upper receptacles are left unused. When a subscriber has more than one <b>telephone</b> <b>socket,</b> they typically are connected so that two telephones can not be connected to the telephone exchange at the same time. This is done by connecting the two upper receptacles of a socket to the lower receptacles of the next socket. When a connected telephone's handset is lifted the two twisted pair connections are separated, thus disconnecting any telephones downward in the chain.|$|E
50|$|While some {{analogue}} {{mobile phones}} provided a standard RJ11 <b>telephone</b> <b>socket</b> into which a normal landline modem could be plugged, this only provided slow dial-up connections, usually 2.4 kilobit per second (kbit/s) or less. The {{next generation of}} phones, known as 2G (for 'second generation'), were digital, and offered faster dial-up speeds of 9.6kbit/s or 14.4kbit/s {{without the need for}} a separate modem. A further evolution called HSCSD used multiple GSM channels (two or three in each direction) to support up to 43.2kbit/s. All of these technologies still required their users to have a dial-up ISP to connect to and provide the Internet access - it was not provided by the mobile phone network itself.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard Swedish plugs and sockets, RJ11 connectors are quite common, especially in offices. Even 8P8C modular <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets</b> can be found. Most telephone equipment sold in Sweden today has RJ11 sockets and corresponding cables with 6P4C plugs on each end and an adaptor from RJ11 to SS 455 15 50 sockets. The Swedish practice with sockets connected in cascade can be maintained with RJ plugs and sockets by using the first pair for connecting the terminal equipment to the PSTN and the second pair for the connection of a line towards the next socket. However, the presence function found in Swedish Standard sockets is lost, so disconnecting a <b>telephone</b> from its <b>socket</b> requires {{replacing it with a}} dummy plug so the sockets further down in the chain will remain connected.|$|R
50|$|TAE (Telekommunikations-Anschluss-Einheit or {{telecommunications}} connection unit) is the German {{standard for}} <b>telephone</b> plugs and <b>sockets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cassette tape recorders, like {{answering}} machines, {{are installed}} between the <b>telephone</b> wall <b>socket</b> and the <b>telephone</b> itself. Telephone calls {{flow through the}} recorder. If the recorder is on, the call is recorded. Recordings are made to magnetic tape and can be replayed on other compatible devices.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, BT Introduced a vDSL {{service to}} the UK known as BT Infinity {{and at the same}} time {{introduced}} the BT vDSL Interstitial Faceplate, which performs two functions: DSL filter and Bell Wire noise suppression. The vDSL modem now plugs directly into the RJ11 socket on the faceplate. The faceplate can be easily fitted by removing the two bottom screws on a NTE5, sliding the bottom section out and fitting this in between. The result is that the entire extension circuit is filtered by the vDSL plate meaning that there is now no need for DSL filters on every <b>Telephone</b> <b>Socket</b> in the house. This product can also be fitted to ADSL lines and has been shown to improve connection speeds for vDSL and aDSL customers alike.|$|E
40|$|The most {{recognizable}} {{characteristic of the}} West German telecommunication infrastructure is the far-reaching isolation of networks, transmission services and terminal equipment. The completion plans of the West German PTT intend to end this separation. Using the telephone network as a base, all services will be integrated {{so that they are}} available from the <b>telephone</b> <b>socket,</b> acting as a communication socket for all transmission purposes. Concerning the political and legal framework, the main characteristic of the West German telecommunication sector is its high degree of regulation. This pattern of regulation is likely to change in 1988 / 89 with a new telecommunication law. The draft of this law proposes the deregulation of all transmission services (except the voice transmission service) and all terminal equipment markets. Networks shall continue to be owned by the West German PTT. ...|$|E
50|$|From July 1982, {{manufacturers}} could submit {{phones to}} be approved by BABT for a cost of £1,700, and if approved would carry the green circular label. The main four British suppliers of telephones were very wary about supplying to non-BT independent retailers. At the same time BT was introducing its so-called IXT phones (IneXpensive Telephone), designed for the new plug-and-socket connections - another innovation. Philips TMC (formerly the Telephone Manufacturing Company) also made the new (more electronic) IXT phones. The British <b>telephone</b> <b>sockets</b> were introduced on 19 November 1981. On 19 July 1982, the government announced its desire to privatise BT, which happened in late 1984. By 1982, 15 million British homes had a phone, with 5 out of 6 only having one phone. Adding an extra phone without the new sockets was heavy work.|$|R
50|$|The Telebrás plug {{is the old}} Brazilian <b>telephone</b> {{plug and}} <b>socket</b> system. It uses a large plug (about 4 cm x 4 cm) with 2 flat metal pins + 2 flat plastic pins. Three of the pins have the same {{orientation}} and the fourth pin being rotated 90 degrees to {{make it impossible to}} plug in the wrong orientation.|$|R
50|$|Lines patched as data ports into {{a network}} switch require simple straight-through patch cables {{at each end}} to connect a computer. Voice patches to PBXs in most {{countries}} require an adapter at the remote end to translate the configuration on 8P8C modular connectors into the local standard <b>telephone</b> wall <b>socket.</b> No adapter is needed in the U.S. as the 6P2C and 6P4C plugs most commonly used with RJ11 and RJ14 telephone connections are physically and electrically compatible with the larger 8P8C socket. RJ25 and RJ61 connections are physically but not electrically compatible, and cannot be used. In the UK, an adapter must be present at the remote end as the 6-pin BT socket is physically incompatible with 8P8C.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, the conference {{compartment}} was equipped with a large table, four freely movable chairs, an electronic typewriter, a fax machine, a <b>telephone</b> and power <b>sockets.</b> It could be used with a reservation {{of at least three}} seats. Originally, first-class tickets were necessary. If there were no reservations in the conference compartment, it could be used at the head conductor's discretion. In 1992, demand was high: the conference compartments were booked 8197 times. A year later, that number dropped to 4400. Before the refurbishment program, the train's only power sockets for passengers were located in the conference compartment.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Electronic Assistive Technology {{including}} Environmental Control Systems (ECS) {{is typically}} considered a specialist area by occupational therapists (Verdonck, McCormack, & Chard, 2011). However, occupational therapists {{need to consider}} ECS in their interventions because ECS use {{has been associated with}} improved quality of life (Rigby, Ryan, & Campbell, 2011) and autonomy for people with high SCI (Verdonck, Chard, & Nolan, 2011). This poster describes a simple ECS starter-pack, the Generic Electronic Assistive Technology pack (GrEAT), developed by an occupational therapist and intended for non-specialist occupational therapists. Method: The starter pack was based on the desires and experiences of users and potential users elicited in a focus group study. The commercial contents were {{selected on the basis of}} an internet search and consultation with experts and suppliers. In addition, supporting audio visual materials were compiled from scratch by the author in order to demonstrate the materials included in the pack. The pack included ECS controllers, mounts, <b>telephones,</b> electric <b>sockets,</b> switches, and an alarm. An information booklet and demonstration DVD included in the pack were compiled during a single person 3 -week pilot study of the starter pack. Results:Modifications were made to the starter-pack during the pilot trial and the GrEAT was subsequently customised for 6 people for use in their own homes for 8 week periods. A collaborative approach was adopted during installations. Five of the six participants used the GrEAT successfully and reported feeling enabled through its use. Conclusions: It is possible for an occupational therapist to develop, customise and install a simple ECS starter-pack. It is useful to support such a pack with an information booklet and video clips all of which have been made freely available online ([URL] and [URL]...|$|R
