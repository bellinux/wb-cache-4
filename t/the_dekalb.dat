Through its 100-year history prominent criminal trials and other events have occurred at the courthouse.|$|E
5000|$|Stevens {{returns to}} Earth, {{to find that}} McLeod, one of his {{engineers}} who had experienced a power failure in his personal craft, has returned. He tells Stevens that he fixed <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs.</b> McLeod broke down in Pennsylvania Dutch country, where he grew up. Visiting an old hex doctor known as Gramps Schneider, McLeod let him look at <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs.</b> Schneider announced that [...] "now the fingers will make", meaning the antennas on <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs</b> will work. McLeod finds to his surprise that <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs</b> are indeed functional. However he has a surprise for Stevens. In operation, the antennas now flex and wiggle like fingers reaching for something.|$|R
5000|$|Schneider {{explains}} an old philosophy, how {{something which}} can be true for this world might not be for the Other World. Since our minds sit in the Other World, this is important. McLeod, according to Schneider, was [...] "tired and fretful", and found one of the [...] "bad truths", causing <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs</b> to fail. Schneider simply looked for the other truth, and <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs</b> worked again.|$|R
5000|$|Waldo {{realizes that}} Stevens' and Grimes' {{problems}} are related. Radiant power is affecting the human nervous system. People feel weak, rundown, fretful, and somehow transfer their malaise to <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs.</b> He also realizes something that Stevens has not noticed. <b>The</b> repaired <b>deKalbs</b> work without broadcast power. Apparently they draw energy from Schneider's [...] "Other World".|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County Circuit Court {{came into}} {{existence}} in June 1839 when the first session of court met in Sycamore's first courthouse building, though the building was somewhat incomplete. At first, it seemed, that Sycamore {{might not be the}} location of <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E

5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County seat was going to be located.|$|E
5|$|Possibly the gem of the Sycamore Historic District is <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County Courthouse. The Courthouse sits in {{the center}} of a square facing Illinois Route 64, {{directly}} across the north/south street, Main, from the Sycamore Public Library. It is a stunning example of Classical Revival architecture. The current structure was erected in 1905 being the third in a line of courthouses to serve DeKalb County.|$|E
5|$|The {{north side}} of <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but {{each has its own}} distinctive qualities. The courthouse drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on the courthouse property. The back side of the building features four pilasters with composite capitals which give the courthouse a temple appearance.|$|E

5000|$|Waldo, meanwhile, having {{satisfied}} {{himself that}} <b>the</b> <b>deKalbs</b> really are having basic problems, also realizes that Grimes is right. Then {{he gets a}} call from NAPA's head of research, Dr. Rambeau, {{who seems to have}} come unhinged. Having seen <b>the</b> wiggling <b>deKalbs,</b> he announces that he knows what is happening. [...] "Magic is loose in the world!" [...] he tells Waldo. He shows Waldo some seemingly impossible tricks he can do now that he understands magic. Waldo calls Stevens to have Rambeau brought to him, but Stevens reports that Rambeau somehow escaped from his restraints without actually unfastening them. Not only that, he has made another set of deKalbs behave as strangely as McLeod's. Waldo asks to have Rambeau's notes and equipment shipped up to him.|$|R

5|$|On February 21, {{exactly a}} week after the {{shooting}} happened, five minutes of silence were observed from 3:06-3:11p.m. CST, accompanied by the tolling of bells throughout the community, at a special ceremony attended by thousands in memory of the victims which was held at the MLK Commons. Moments of silence were also held elsewhere throughout <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> community. There was a special memorial service held in the NIU Convocation Center on February 24, the day before classes resumed, in honor of the victims that initiated a set of activities and services aimed at community recovery. Due to the loss of one week of instructional time {{in the middle of the}} semester, an extra week was added in May.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style.

5|$|Today's DeKalb County Courthouse is {{the third}} {{in a line of}} {{structures}} to carry that name. In 1839 a log structure was built and called the county courthouse; the log building stood {{across the street from the}} current courthouse. Ten years later, in 1850, the second DeKalb County Courthouse was erected. From December 13, 1902 until April 17, 1924, DeKalb-Sycamore Electric Traction Company operated a trolley route between the two cities (DeKalb and Sycamore), which ended at <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County Courthouse. The current courthouse, which sits on the same site as the 1850 building, was erected in 1905.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} as chief {{executive}} officer of Dekalb County, Georgia in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. Jones is the first African American to serve as CEO of the county, and the youngest ever elected in the county. In April 2001, shortly after Jones became CEO, he voted, along with five other DeKalb County Commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried County employees. DeKalb was the first county in Georgia to offer such benefits. During his administration, Dekalb County established the first local Homeland Security Office in 2001. Under Jones, DeKalb County approved creation of a new senior center, increased funding for roads, libraries, and park improvements while maintaining a balanced budget, and increasing the County's credit rating to AAA. As CEO, Jones promoted and achieved passage of a $125 million bond referendum that allowed for the acquisition of 2,735 acre expansion of <b>the</b> <b>DeKalb</b> County's green space, increasing the county's parks and green space by 70%. He requested and received Congressional designation of Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area. Jones was also primarily responsible for creation of Dekalb County’s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in new investments.|$|E
