On a Bare Roll <b>treater</b> station the dielectric encapsulates the electrode. On a Covered Roll station it encapsulates the <b>treater</b> base roll. The <b>treater</b> consists of an electrode and a base roll in both stations. In theory a Covered Roll <b>treater</b> is generally used to treat non-conductive webs, and a Bare Roll <b>treater</b> is used to treat conductive webs.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} eanied out to {{investigate}} the effects of Raphani Semen on immuno-response in the mouse model of allergic asthma. Methods: In this study, BALB/C mice were divided into 6 groups: Normal (Non-treated group), Control (Group with not <b>treated</b> after allergic sensitization and induction by ovalbumin), <b>Treat</b> I (Group with the oral administration of saline after allergic sensitization and induction by ovalbumin), <b>Treat</b> n (Allergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with acupuncture (BL 13)), <b>Treat</b> III (Allergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with the oral administration of Raphani Semen) and <b>Treat</b> lV (Allergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with the herbal-acupuncture of Raphani Semen (BL 13)). The effect on cytokine was assessed by measuring cytokine (lL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 12, IFN-r) in bronchoalveoar lavage fluid(ELISA). ResuJts : The results obtained as follows: 1. The production of Interleukin- 2 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> n group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. 2. The production of Interleukin- 4 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> II group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. Among them. the production of Interleukin- 4 was decreased remarkably in <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with other groups. 3. The production of Interleukin- 5 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. 4. The production of Interleukin- 10 was decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group and <b>Treat</b> III group as compared with Control group. 5. The production of Interleukin- 12 was all decreased significantly in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> n group, <b>Treat</b> m group and <b>Treat</b> IV group as compared with Control group. 6. The production of Intelferon- showed no significant changes in <b>Treat</b> I group, <b>Treat</b> n group. <b>Treat</b> m group and <b>Treat</b> Ⅳ group as compared with Control group. Conclusion: These {{results show that the}} production of Interleukin- 4, 5 was decreased significantly in aJlergic asthma group <b>treated</b> with the herbal-acupuncture of Raph Semen (BL 13), It is known that inactivity of Th 2 cell constrained the revelation and controlled hypersenstive action.

50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{understanding of}} countertransference is thus generally to regard countertransference as a “jointly created” phenomenon between the <b>treater</b> and the patient. The patient pressures the <b>treater</b> through transference into {{playing a role}} congruent with the patient’s internal world. However, the specific dimensions of that role are colored by treater’s own personality. Countertransference can be a therapeutic tool when examined by the <b>treater</b> to sort out who is doing what, and the meaning behind those interpersonal roles (The differentiation of the object’s interpersonal world between self and other). Nothing in the new understanding alters of course the need for continuing awareness of the dangers in the narrow perspective - of 'serious risks of unresolved countertransference difficulties being acted out within what {{is meant to be}} a therapeutic relationship'; but 'from that point on, transference and counter-transference were looked upon as an inseparable couple..."total situation"'.|$|E
