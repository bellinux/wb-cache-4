5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|The Warners {{starred in}} the feature-length, direct-to-video movie Wakko's Wish. The movie {{takes place in the}} fictional town of Acme Falls, in which the Warners {{and the rest of the}} Animaniacs cast are under the rule of a greedy king who conquered their home country from a {{neighboring}} country. When the Warners find out about a star that will grant a wish to the first person <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> it, the Warners, the villagers (the Animaniacs cast), and the king race to get to it first. Although children and adults rated Wakko's Wish highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than spend money on advertising. Warner Bros. released the movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.|$|E

Traditionally Talmudic statements are classified into two broad categories, halakhic and aggadic statements. Halakhic statements directly relate to questions of Jewish law and practice (halakha). Aggadic statements are not legally related, but rather are exegetical, homiletical, ethical, or historical in nature.|$|E

25|$|A {{unicycle}} is {{a vehicle}} <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> {{the ground with}} only one wheel. The most common variation has a frame with a saddle, and has a pedal-driven direct drive. Unicycling is practiced professionally in circuses, by street performers, in festivals, and as a hobby. Unicycles have also been used to create new sports such as unicycle hockey. In recent years, unicycles have also been used in activities similar to mountain biking or trials.|$|E
25|$|For example, if {{the given}} {{manifold}} is a -sphere, then one can picture the tangent space {{at a point}} as the plane <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> the sphere at that point and is perpendicular to the sphere’s radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space, then one can picture a tangent space in this literal fashion. This was the traditional approach toward defining parallel transport and was used by Dirac. More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.|$|E
25|$|The {{capital and}} largest city is Lahore {{which was the}} {{historical}} capital of the wider Punjab region. Other important cities include Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Multan, Sialkot, Bahawalpur, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Jhelum and Sahiwal. The undivided Punjab region was home to six rivers, of which five flow through Pakistan's Punjab province. From west to east, the rivers are: the Indus, Jhelum, Beas, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej. Nearly 60% of Pakistan's population lives in the Punjab. It is the nation's only province <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> every other province; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at Islamabad. In the acronym P-A-K-I-S-T-A-N, the P is for Punjab.|$|E

25|$|There {{are limits}} {{placed on the}} steps a player may take without dribbling, which {{commonly}} results in an infraction known as traveling. Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling. A dribble <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble. Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing {{his hand on the}} bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball. A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
25|$|Cruzado also {{established}} several advisory groups to assist her in making decisions. In {{order to achieve}} more transparency in decision-making, Cruzado created five new advisory committees in 2010. These include the University Council, which is an overarching committee <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> on all things at MSU; a Budget Committee; a Planning Committee; a Deans' Committee; and a Research Council. With {{only a third of}} tenured faculty at MSU women and almost two-thirds of low-paid adjunct faculty women, Cruzado announced the creation of a 24-member President's Commission on the Status of University Women in September 2011 to determine causes and suggest solutions. In May 2012, she proposed creation of a seventh body, the Council on Leadership, Outreach and Engagement. This council was charged with promoting outreach activities by administrators, faculty, and students, and enhancing public awareness of the same.|$|E

25|$|I am {{not only}} a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains {{the right of the}} Jews to control their fate and their future. I {{consider}} the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E
25|$|The proverb Ngam jam, o yas jam (rain in peace! Sow in peace) is {{the first}} word Serer farmers utter during the first rain. It is also the way the Serers wish each other happy New Year. As well as an expression, it also a {{religious}} prayer. The first rain of the season is a pact between the transcendent power and humanity. It {{is a sign of}} life which continues to be transmitted by this tutelary power, which has long respected the pact. Custom dictates that, the first three steps on the damp earth of the first rain to be made barefooted in order to connect with mother nature. The father or the mother of the family would be given a calabash of the water of the first rain, for the whole family to drink. This water is holy and is viewed as sacred which would protect them from all misfortunes that may occur during the rainy season. Under the Saas tree, containers were placed under it to collect the water <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> the tree. This water was used for bathing as a sign of protection.|$|E
25|$|The Thessalian {{period in}} Simonides' career is {{followed}} in most biographies by {{his return to}} Athens during the Persian Wars and {{it is certain that}} he became a prominent international figure at that time, particularly as the author of commemorative verses. According to an anonymous biographer of Aeschylus, the Athenians chose Simonides ahead of Aeschylus to be the author of an epigram honouring their war-dead at Marathon, which led the tragedian (who had fought at the battle and whose brother had died there) to withdraw sulking to the court of Hieron of Syracuse—the story is probably based on the inventions of comic dramatists but it is likely that Simonides did in fact write some kind of commemorative verses for the Athenian victory at Marathon. His ability to compose tastefully and poignantly on military themes put him in great demand among Greek states after their defeat of the second Persian invasion, when he is known to have composed epitaphs for Athenians, Spartans and Corinthians, a commemorative song for Leonidas and his men, a dedicatory epigram for Pausanias, and poems on the battles of Artemisium, Salamis, and Plataea. According to Plutarch, the Cean had a statue of himself made about this time, which inspired the Athenian politician Themistocles to comment on his ugliness. In the same account, Themistocles is said to have rejected an attempt by the poet to bribe him, then likened himself as an honest magistrate to a good poet, since an honest magistrate keeps the laws and a good poet keeps in tune. Suda mentions a feud between Simonides and the Rhodian lyric poet, Timocreon, for whom Simonides apparently composed a mock epitaph <b>that</b> <b>touches</b> {{on the issue of the}} Rhodian's medism—an issue that also involved Themistocles.|$|E
