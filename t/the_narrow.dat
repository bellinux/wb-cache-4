5|$|After Thermopylae, all of Boeotia and Attica {{fell to the}} Persian army, which {{captured}} and burnt Athens. However, a larger Allied army fortified <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Isthmus of Corinth, protecting the Peloponnesus from Persian conquest.

The Athenian general Themistocles succeeded in luring the Persian navy into <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Straits of Salamis, where the huge number of Persian ships became disorganised, and were soundly beaten by the Allied fleet. The Allied victory at Salamis prevented a quick conclusion to the invasion, and fearing becoming trapped in Europe, Xerxes retreated to Asia leaving his general Mardonius to finish the conquest with the elite of the army.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Doria, {{named for}} the 16th century Genoese admiral of the same name, was laid down at the La Spezia {{shipyard}} in Naples on 24 March 1912. She was launched on 30 March 1913 and completed by 13 March 1916. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Adriatic Sea and did not emerge {{for the duration of}} the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority.

5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing through <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. <b>The</b> <b>narrow</b> defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours, Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle.
