40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{business}} interactions involved in the purchase of services related <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities. We build on the literature about business services classifications and the interaction between clients and providers of business services. An empirical study is conducted by means of a survey questionnaire. Data were collected from a sample of 80 buying firms of services related <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities who agreed to cooperate and represent medium and large Portuguese’s firms. The results show that the buying of services related <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities involves both the client and the provider in the interaction process. This paper contributes to understanding the interaction process of buying services related <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities in terms of the parties involved, product/service exchange, financial and information exchange. Providers of services related <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities can expect stable and preferred relationships if they can offer a good price and quality of service, meet the agreed deadlines and respond quickly to client orders. On the client’s side, the relevance, the characteristics and the wide diversity of services related <b>to</b> <b>marketing</b> activities requires a good understanding and management of the interaction portfolio with providers.
