25|$|A related {{speculation}} by Sagan and Newman {{suggests that}} if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is {{a tiny fraction of}} the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.|$|E

500|$|The Democratic Party {{was also}} in disarray in Arkansas in 1867-68. [...] One unifying {{principle}} of the Democrats, however, was white supremacy and resistance to black suffrage. [...] At the January 27, 1868, Democratic State Convention in Little Rock, Democrats announced the avowed purpose of uniting [...] "the opponents of negro suffrage and domination." [...] Some party leaders opposed Reconstruction in favor of continued military rule, which was far from what they wanted, but seemed like a better option than allowing freedmen all {{the civil rights of}} white citizens, including the right to vote. The more conservative wings of the party simply showed no interest in the new constitution and remained loyal to the ideas embodied in the Confederacy. During the constitutional convention, Democrats convened their own party convention. Many chose to boycott elections {{on the grounds that the}} new constitution was illegal, because it disenfranchised them while giving suffrage to the Freedmen, whom they insisted were an inferior race. They also alienated the Freedmen who were now the largest block of voters in the state, by adopting resolutions against them: their first resolution of the convention was [...] "Resolved, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> favor of a [...] White Man's Government in a White Man's country."

Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end." ...|$|E

Madonna, being interested in the cult of celebrity, found that many of the rumors surrounding Simpson's life are untrue and she could not find any empirical evidence supporting them. Hence she wanted to portray Simpson as a human being with flaws, imperfections and a vulnerable side.
