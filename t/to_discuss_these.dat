500|$|At {{the conference}} in Vienna later in the year, Metternich found himself {{constrained}} by the Kings of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German federation. He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before. Nevertheless, he held ground on other issues and the Conference's Final Act was highly reactionary, much as Metternich had envisaged it. He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820, finding the whole affair a bore. On 6 May he heard {{of the death of}} his daughter Klementine from tuberculosis. Journeying on to Prague, he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease. He was at her bedside in Baden bei Wien when she died on 20 July. This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France. The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond. Ultimately, the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge (a policy favoured by the Russians) and keeping out of a country in which Austria had no interest (favoured by the British). He chose [...] "sympathetic inactivity" [...] on Spain but, much to his dismay and surprise, Guglielmo Pepe led a revolt in Naples in early July and forced King Ferdinand I to accept a new constitution. Metternich reluctantly agreed to attend the Russian-initiated Congress of Troppau in October <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>these</b> events. He need not have worried: the Tsar gave way and accepted a compromise proposal of moderate interventionism. Still worried by Kapodistrias' influence over the Tsar, he laid down his conservative principles in a long memorandum, including an attack on the free press and the initiative of the middle classes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{highlight}} the pervasive influence of information technologies on multinational enterprise (MNE) operations, strategies and structures. The democratization of information technologies has diminished geographic distance and compressed response times for MNEs.

We explore the consequences of this change in emphasis for MNE strategic and structural orientations as established by Bartlett and Ghoshal 2 ̆ 7 s typology of MNE strategies.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of multicore platforms {{has led to}} much recent work on multiprocessor scheduling techniques for soft realtime workloads.

In this paper, this question is addressed via a video-decoding case study in which a scheme based on the global earliest-deadline-first (G-EDF) algorithm was compared against Linux’s CFS scheduler. In this study, the G-EDF-based scheme proved to be superior under heavy workloads in terms of several timing metrics, including jitter and deadline tardiness. Prior <b>to</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>these</b> results, an explanation of how existing G-EDF-related scheduling theory was applied to provision the studied system is given and various “mismatches ” between theoretical assumptions and practice that were faced are discussed. ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{the negotiators}} reached Athens, {{they made a}} speech to the Athenian {{assembly}} in which they argued that the Athenians should take advantage of the opportunity they had to make peace. The Spartans, they claimed, had suffered a misfortune not through incapacity or overreaching, but through mere bad luck; the Athenians should seize this opportunity to have peace with them on good terms. This proposal, however, met with derision from the Athenian statesman Cleon; he demanded far harsher terms, which would have given Athens control over Megara and compelled Sparta to abandon several important allies. [...] In his speech, he recalled the concessions Athens had been forced to make in the Thirty Years' Peace of 445 BC, when the Athenians had been at a similar momentary disadvantage. Cleon's terms, Donald Kagan has argued, represented a recognition that the Athenians had little to gain from a peace which surrendered the advantage they had just won without impairing the Spartans' ability to make war, while they might secure far better terms in the future by pressing their advantage. When the Spartans asked <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>these</b> proposals in private, Cleon demanded that they say whatever they had to say in public. By doing so, he guaranteed that the Spartans would be forced to cut off the negotiations (since they could hardly discuss betraying their allies in public), hastening the moment when the Athenians would be free to move against Sphacteria.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The public {{consensus}} of evaluations {{is an important}} issue in the quantitative research. Most of research tools, like the survey or questionnaire, are to ask people to answer their thinking in binary logic and provide a single answer on some items. They usually adopt statistical computations in traditional approaches to express public consensus. However, this process ignores the fuzzy thinking perceived in human logic and recognition. Fuzzy theory provides the logic of multi-logic which is beyond the limitations of binary logic. Thus, it will be more proper to employ the membership function and fuzzy statistical analysis. In this paper we will provide the definition of fuzzy mode, its proofs and properties. In addition <b>to</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>these</b> characteristics of fuzzy mode, we also apply the fuzzy mode in measuring public consensus with empirical data of educational survey. In the conclusion, suggestions and recommendations for future research and advanced issues are presented. Key-Words: educational measurement, fuzzy logic, fuzzy mode, membership functions. ...|$|R
