However, energy and bandwidth management need to be further improved to extend network life cycle and reduce potential network segmentation. Aiming to balance the network energy consumption, this paper proposes an adaptive relay node selection algorithm based on the opportunity (OAR). In OAR, <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relay</b> nodes are chosen to act as candidates based on bit error rate (BER) estimation, and then, the relay is adaptively and opportunistically determined for packet forwarding. Residual energy is considered to avoid fast energy exhaustion for some certain nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed OAR algorithm improves the network performance by deferring the earliest death time of the nodes and extending the network life cycle.|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{adaptive}} cooperative scheme with a multi-relay node that achieves high bandwidth efficiency and achieves better SEP performance. In the proposed protocol, if {{the quality of}} the direct channel is better than that of the all channels from relays to destination, the source will transmit directly to the destination. Otherwise, the source broadcasts the signal and then a potential relay will be chosen to help the source. A re-transmission will also occur if <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relay</b> cannot be detected. The spectral efficiency is first derived by calculating the probability of each mode, i. e., direct and cooperation transmission. Subsequently, the SEP performance of M-PSK modulation for the scheme is analyzed by considering each event where the source transmits data to the destination. Finally, the obtained analytical results are verified through computer simulations...|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} category, the {{proposed}} techniques use a contention mechanism to disseminate warning messages {{based on the}} distance between a receiver and a source node. An example of this mechanism is the timer- and probability-based protocols which aim to suppress the broadcast storm [11]. Based on its respective distance to the sender of a warning message, each vehicle is assigned with a wait time or a probability of transmission. Being given the shortest wait time or the highest probability of transmission, the vehicle located furthest {{in the range of}} the sender rebroadcasts the warning message. Upon receiving this duplicate message, all other vehicles withdraw their intention to rebroadcast. The timer and probability based protocols suffer from packet collisions due to nodes selecting the same probability or wait time for transmission. This can happen when <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relay</b> nodes are close to each other and at a similar distance from the warning message sender.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Communication {{gains from}} {{relaying}} can be acquired {{even in the}} absence of altruistic or dedicated relays. To accommodate this, spectrum leasing for cooperation paradigm prescribes that <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relaying</b> node is rewarded for its relaying role with a fraction of source’s bandwidth. Recently, a twohop spectrum leasing scheme was proposed that enables the source to employ the relay only to an extent it finds beneficial, preserving the remaining bandwidth for its direct transmission, if necessary. Such a solution adds flexibility that can be particularly useful for implementation in networks involving more than two hops. In this paper, we extend this setup to include the relay selection problem in a two-hop network scenario with multiple <b>potential</b> <b>relays.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relays</b> are selfish nodes, their competitive attitude for accessing the spectrum needs to be taken into account.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{cognitive}} routing {{coupled with}} spectrum sensing and sharing in a multi-channel multi-hop cognitive radio network (CRN) is investigated. Recognizing the spectrum dynamics in CRN, we propose an opportunistic cognitive routing (OCR) protocol that {{allows users to}} exploit the geographic location information and discover the local spectrum access opportunities to improve the transmission performance over each hop. Specifically, based on location information and channel usage statistics, a secondary user (SU) distributedly selects the next hop relay and adapts its transmission to the dynamic spectrum access opportunities in its neighborhood. In addition, we introduce a novel metric, namely, cognitive transport throughput (CTT), to capture the unique properties of CRN and evaluate <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relay</b> gain of each relay candidate. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to reduce the searching complexity of the optimal selection of channel and relay. Simulation results are given to demonstrate that our proposed OCR well adapts to the spectrum dynamics and outperforms existing routing protocols in CRN.

40|$|Broadcast {{nature of}} {{wireless}} networks can be exploited {{to provide a}} flexible transmission, especially in multicast service. <b>The</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relay</b> then is capable to participate in message forwarding. In this paper, we first presents a network coding based cooperative (NCBC) multicast scheme exploiting limited feedback, where the source transmits two separate signals to multiple destinations in two successive half slots. The relay may combine the signals if it received two signals correctly and forward it to destinations in the next half slot. The destinations, therefore, can recover signals either from direct transmission or the relay forwarding. The performance analysis on the developed NCBC multicast protocol is given {{in the viewpoint of}} physical layer, such as the outage probability and diversity order. It is demonstrated that the NCBC multicast scheme can work better than the source direct multicast in terms of outage probability. Meanwhile, the NCBC multicast scheme can achieve full diversity gain(diversity two for one relay case). Comparing with the known relay schemes, i. e., amplify-andforward (AF) and selection decode-and-forward cooperation schemes, it shows that the NCBC multicast scheme achieves almost the same outage performance with relatively less bandwidth and energy consumption. </p...|$|E

However, the successful dissemination of multi-hop warning messages beyond the transmission range of a vehicle faces three major issues: (i) the broadcast storm, (ii) the severe interference with the existing periodic single-hop safety messages, and (iii) the hidden nodes. In this paper, we propose an efficient time-slotted multi-hop broadcast protocol that significantly reduces the number of required transmissions, while ensuring a timely and successful delivery of the warning messages. To alleviate the broadcast storm problem, we select only a subset of vehicles {{on the road to}} serve as <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relay</b> nodes. Each of these ‘segment leaders’ is responsible for forwarding the warning messages arrived in its own road segment. To avoid interfering with the safety messages transmitted periodically, we propose to allocate separate time slots for the warning messages. We also devise a signaling mechanism that ensures the reliable delivery of these multi-hop messages. Simulation results confirm that the developed protocol substantially outperforms existing schemes {{in terms of the number}} of required multi-hop transmissions and the dissemination delay. At the same time, the proposed solution maintains a high reception rate and low end-to-end delay for the single-hop safety messages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Intermittently {{connected}} mobile {{networks are}} wireless networks {{where most of}} the time there does not exist a complete path from a source to a destination. Researchers have proposed flooding based schemes for routing in such networks. While flooding based schemes are robust and have a high probability of delivery, they suffer from a huge overhead in terms of bandwidth, buffer space and energy dissipation due to large number of transmissions per packet. So flooding based schemes are impractical for resource constrained networks. Controlled replication or spraying methods can reduce this overhead by distributing a small, fixed number of copies to only a few relays, which then independently route each copy towards the destination. These schemes demonstrate a good delay performance without using a lot of resources. There are three important questions {{in the context of the}} design of these spraying based schemes: (i) How many copies per packet should be distributed? (ii) How to distribute these copies amongst <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>relays?</b> (iii) How are each of these copies routed towards the destination? The first and the third questions have been studied in detail by different researchers. But, there has been no study which looks at the second question. This paper fills this void. Specifically, we propose a methodology to derive the optimal spraying policy. As a case study, we find the optimal spraying policy for two different spraying based schemes. Finally, we study the optimal policies to infer simple heuristics which achieve expected delays very close to the optimal. I...|$|R

Existing literature on successive relaying does not consider the channel quality of the inter-relay channel in maximising the capacity performance.
