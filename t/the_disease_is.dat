5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more common in males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not {{believed to be a}} cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|DPB is idiopathic, {{which means}} an exact physiological, environmental, or {{pathogenic}} cause of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> unknown. However, several factors are suspected {{to be involved}} with its pathogenesis (the way in which the disease works).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{preventable}} {{with the}} polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E

2500|$|According to John Bennett, a {{young farmer}} {{at the time}} of the crisis at Manor Farm in Worcestershire, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} into <b>the</b> county [...] "when a local farmer fed skimmed milk, bought from Shropshire where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> raging out of control, to his pigs".|$|R
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> caused by a biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{recognized}} by the French doctor Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882 and lent his name to the condition. In 1902, its mode of inheritance was discovered by Nathan Brill. The neuronal damage associated with <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> discovered in <b>the</b> 1920s, and the biochemical basis for <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> elucidated in <b>the</b> 1960s by Roscoe Brady. The first effective treatment for <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>the</b> drug alglucerase (Ceredase), {{was approved by the}} FDA in April 1991. An improved drug, imiglucerase (Cerezyme), was approved by the FDA in May 1994 and has replaced the use of Ceredase.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{reported}} in the USA in 1935 affecting Platanus × acerifolia. In subsequent years <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> reported in most Atlantic seaboard states. It was subsequently observed in plantations and in natural forests of Platanus occidentalis. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> has also <b>been</b> reported in California. In Philadelphia <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> had killed 10,000 {{out of a total}} 150,000 trees by 1945. In Gloucester, New Jersey, 87% of London plane trees had died by 1949.|$|R
5000|$|Schools {{were closed}} {{for a week}} due to <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> but <b>were</b> ordered by the Ministry of Education to open after the {{holidays}} even though <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> not fully under control.|$|R
5|$|By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimated}} that 4,011 people had {{succumbed to the}} waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and {{the total number of}} cases recorded had reached 89,018. In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. There had been signs that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> abating, with cholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 cases a week.|$|E
5|$|Chagas {{disease has}} a serious {{economic}} impact on the United States and the world. The cost of treatment in the United States alone, where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not indigenous, {{is estimated to be}} $900 million annually, which includes hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers. The global cost is estimated at $7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Disease-modifying {{treatments}} only {{reduce the}} progression {{rate of the}} disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> associated {{with a variety of}} symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and handicap. Management of these deficits is therefore very important.|$|E
50|$|Prior to this time, many {{physicians}} believed <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{caused by}} direct {{exposure to the}} products of filth and decay. Koch helped establish that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> more specifically contagious and was transmitted by exposure to the feces of an infected person, including through contaminated water supply.|$|R
2500|$|... 1897: <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} by Karel Maydl (1853–1903).|$|R

5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, hence this form of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> also known as black pox.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people {{infected}}, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> chronic, and without treatment, they are infected {{for the remainder of}} their lives. However, there is now an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with cancer, direct {{treatment of the}} cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E
50|$|The first {{description}} of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> written in 1973.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{identified}} in 1967 {{in a closed}} herd of captive mule deer in contiguous portions of northeastern Colorado. In 1980, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> determined to be a TSE. It was first {{identified in}} wild elk and mules in 1981 in Colorado and Wyoming, and in farmed elk in 1997.|$|R
30|$|There <b>are</b> many {{epidemic}} <b>diseases</b> in <b>the</b> swine population such as {{swine fever}} disease, {{foot and mouth disease}} and Aujesky’s <b>disease.</b> One of <b>the</b> most devastating <b>diseases</b> <b>is</b> porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which was first {{reported in the}} United States in 1987 [1]. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> named <b>the</b> “mystery swine disease”. In 1990, the first European outbreak of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> reported in Germany [2], after which it spread throughout Europe [3].|$|R
5|$|In Argentina, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{known as}} mal de Chagas-Mazza, {{in honor of}} Salvador Mazza, the Argentine {{physician}} who in 1926 began investigating the disease {{and over the years}} became the principal researcher of this disease in the country. Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.|$|E
5|$|In Atlanta, {{representatives of}} the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) of the CDC and express fears that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a bio weapon {{intended}} to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak back to Emhoff while negotiating with local bureaucrats initially reluctant to commit resources for a proper public health response to the virus. Dr. Mears later becomes infected and dies.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
50|$|Originally <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> called GRID (Gay-Related Immune Deficiency), but by 1982, after {{scientific}} discovery that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> also transmitted by other means, plus political pressure {{from those who}} felt the name unfairly stigmatized homosexuals, the designation was officially changed to AIDS. In Africa, where {{the vast majority of}} cases have always been (about 20 times as many cases as in the United States), <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> has always <b>been</b> found in the general population.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{described}} in 1920 by Lhermitte and Duclos.|$|R

5|$|In the United States, gout {{is twice}} as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> rare in {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring.

5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age. The primary progressive subtype {{is more common in}} people in their fifties. Similar to many autoimmune disorders, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more common in women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E
5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{review on}} Porokeratosis Mibelli is {{presented}} and four cases of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> reported.

All the four patients showed annular lesions, one papular lesions and one linear warty streak resembling linear naevus...|$|R
50|$|Aleutian <b>Disease</b> <b>was</b> first {{recognized}} in ranch-raised mink in 1956. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{so named because}} it was first found in mink with the Aleutian coat color gene, a gun-metal grey pelt.
