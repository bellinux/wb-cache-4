A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of <b>this</b> <b>line,</b> encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which has in the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use <b>this</b> <b>line</b> instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E

He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though <b>this</b> <b>line</b> of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E

5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. <b>This</b> <b>line</b> was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, <b>this</b> <b>line</b> was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E

50|$|During the {{southwest}} monsoon, southwesterly winds {{pass over the}} mountains of Sumatra and creates mountain waves on the leeward {{side of the mountain}} thus creating an unstable atmosphere. As the atmosphere becomes highly unstable, the thunderstorms begin to merge into each other forming a squall <b>line.</b> <b>This</b> squall <b>line</b> is then steered by {{the southwest}}erly winds causing the storm to move northeastwards and moving into the Straits of Malacca. When <b>this</b> squall <b>line</b> moves offshore to the Straits of Malacca, it is usually night and thus, warmer air rising over the Straits of Malacca would cause the squall line to intensify. As the abundance of moisture over the Straits of Malacca condenses, it releases huge amounts of latent heat of condensation and this helps the squall line maintain its strength and intensify even more. <b>This</b> squall <b>line</b> then moves towards the coast of Peninsular Malaysia or Singapore. As <b>this</b> squall <b>line</b> moves inland, it is deprived of latent heat of condensation and hence, dissipates rapidly.|$|R
