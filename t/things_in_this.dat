5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
25|$|This {{is similar}} to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar {{attention}} is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for Allah (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Tulliver did not willingly write a letter, {{and found}} the {{relation}} between spoken and written language, briefly known as spelling, {{one of the most}} puzzling <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> puzzling world. Nevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done in less time than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs. Glegg's,–why, she belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a matter of private judgment.|$|E

That's a coffin. There's one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world which a person don't ever try to jew you down on. That's a coffin. There's one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world which a person don't say--"I'll look around a little, and if I find I can't do better I'll come back and take it." [...] That's a coffin.

That's a coffin. And there's one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world which you don't have to worry around after a person to get him to pay for. And that's a coffin.

25|$|There are two <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{definition}} that may need some clarification. First, {{the process of}} risk management is an ongoing, iterative process. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new threats and vulnerabilities emerge every day. Second, the choice of countermeasures (controls) used to manage risks must {{strike a balance between}} productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected.|$|E
25|$|Marlowe plays a {{major role}} in Elizabeth Bear's Promethean Age Series (2006-2013), which {{combines}} elements of secret history and fantasy. Among other <b>things,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> account Marlowe and Shakespeare had a secret, deeply emotional homosexual love affair and many of Shakespeare's Sonnets were written to express his love for Marlowe. Also, as depicted in the Promethean Age series, Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch Morgan le Fay.|$|E
25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, {{nor do we}} prove it a priori. But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from {{the things that have}} been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of the <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E

500|$|I {{live the}} life that most would die for, but there's {{a lot of things}} that come with this life. People don't take that into consideration. There are a lot of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> life that I would trade in a minute just for a slice of normalcy [...] I just listed a few things that they {{probably}} never viewed from that particular perspective. Because I think people need to see things another way; they need to see it other than just celebrity.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would {{be able to make a}} real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 5th century BC Plato {{complained that}} [...] "the loss of timber had denuded {{the hills and}} plains {{surrounding}} Athens and caused massive soil erosion."

2500|$|... "There {{are still}} {{people who do not}} {{conceive}} that reason must apply to all <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world and command all human activity; for these people certain domains, that of religion in particular, must escape the ascendancy of the intelligence. But then, in behaving this way one destroys at one blow the fervour and veneration that we all owe to the sacred. How admit this ostracism against reason? How abase ourselves to this functioning of an intelligent animal?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, the {{directional}} pervasions {{can then}} be applied {{to each of the}} unspecific and specific pervasions. For instance, after radiating benevolence to all beings in the east (Sabbe puratthimāya disāya sattā ...), one radiates it to all beings in the west and then north and then south, etc.; then, one radiates it to all breathing <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion (Sabbe puratthimāya disāya ...), then all creatures, persons, and so forth until such is extended for all those born in the lower realms.|$|E
2500|$|Editorially, Raymond {{sought a}} niche between Greeley's open {{partisanship}} and Bennett's party-neutrality. In {{the first issue}} of the Times Raymond announced his purpose to write in temperate and measured language and to get into a passion as rarely as possible. [...] "There are few <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world which it is worthwhile to get angry about; and they are just the things anger will not improve." [...] In controversy he meant to avoid abusive language. His editorials were generally cautious, impersonal, and finished in form.|$|E

2500|$|We {{have the}} intuition that Mary has been {{deprived}} of some vital data {{to do with the}} experience of redness. It is also uncontroversial that some things cannot be learned inside the room; for example, we do not expect Mary to learn how to ski within the room. Lewis has articulated that information and ability are potentially different <b>things.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, physicalism is still compatible with the conclusion that Mary gains new knowledge. It is also useful for considering other instances of qualia; [...] "being a bat" [...] is an ability, so it is know-how knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Tiner {{served in}} the United States Marines and fought for {{thirteen}} months in the Vietnam War. He was trained at Parris Island, South Carolina, and was a combat correspondent with the 3rd Marine Division. Having been reared in a segregationist society, Tiner recalled having been [...] "thrown together in boot camp, black and white people from the South. All of that made a very profound impact on me, to see black Marines getting shot and dying for their country.

2500|$|... "The {{important}} change which they (the sponsors) proposed to make from {{the provisions of}} the tariff of 1846 was to substitute specific for ad-valorem duties. Such a change from ad-valorem to specific duties is in itself by no means objectionable; but it has usually been made a pretext on the part of protectionists for a considerable increase in the actual duties paid. When protectionists make a change of this kind, they almost invariably make the specific duties higher than the ad-valorem duties for which {{they are supposed to be}} an equivalent...The Morrill tariff formed no exception to the usual course of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> respect. The specific duties which it established were in many cases considerably above the ad-valorem duties of 1846.
