5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to {{a vote in the}} Senate, and Williams failed to deliver his votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E
5|$|During his {{slump in}} form, D'Oliveira was {{contacted}} by Tienie Oosthuizen, a {{director at the}} tobacco company Carreras, which was, alongside Rothmans, part of the South African Rembrandt Tobacco Corporation. Rembrandt {{had set up a}} group known as the South African Sports Foundation (SASF) to promote amateur sport. Oosthuizen told D'Oliveira that he represented Rothmans, who had sponsored matches featuring D'Oliveira while he was waiting to qualify for Worcestershire. He offered D'Oliveira work as a coach for the SASF on an annual salary of £4,000—a vast sum for a professional cricketer at the time—on the condition that he took up this role immediately {{at the end of the}} 1968 season, and thereby made himself unavailable for the MCC tour before selection took place. D'Oliveira tentatively declined, but Oosthuizen persisted, first offering to find out if he would be included in the MCC team, then telling him that his presence in that side would embarrass Vorster. D'Oliveira was aware that accepting the offer could cause many to lose respect for him as he would be abandoning the opportunity to play against South Africa, but nevertheless considered it over the following weeks. Oosthuizen repeatedly pressured him to accept. Shortly before the final Test of 1968, he offered personally to match the money that D'Oliveira <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been offered to make himself available for the MCC team. D'Oliveira stalled, and involved his agent, Reg Hayter. After further conversations with Oosthuizen, D'Oliveira decided to try to postpone a decision until after the team to tour South Africa was announced—Hayter had established from a source close to the selectors that D'Oliveira had a good chance of being picked.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E

25|$|Wilson had hoped, {{as early}} as March 1905, to succeed Rawlinson as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley, when Rawlinson <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been offered a brigadier-general’s staff {{position}} at Aldershot Command; however the move was postponed {{until the end of}} the year. In June 1905 Wilson learned that Arnold-Forster (Secretary of State for War) thought him the man for the job, but on 12 July Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), who appears to have disliked Wilson, raised the job to a brigadier-general’s position, for which Wilson was not yet senior enough.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} from Grenoble {{to take part}} in the 1926 elections, and ran as a candidate for the town of Focşani. He lost, and, although it had had a considerable success, the League disbanded in the same year. Codreanu gathered former members of the League who had spent time in prison, and put into practice his dream of forming the Legion (November 1927, just a few days after the fall of a new Averescu cabinet, which had continued to support Cuza). Codreanu claimed to had a vision of the Archangel Michael who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been chosen by God to be Romania's savior. Right from the start, a commitment to the values of the Eastern Orthodox Church was core to the message of the Legion, and Codreanu's alleged vision was a centerpiece of his message.|$|E
25|$|On October 15, 1976, Carlo Gambino {{died of a}} heart attack. With Gambino gone, Bruno {{lost his}} most {{important}} ally in the underworld. Many of Bruno's subordinates felt that they were missing out on money because of Bruno's old-fashioned and content ways. His consigliere Antonio Caponigro approached Genovese family boss Frank Tieri in order to seek the Commission's permission to kill Bruno and take over the crime family. Tieri, sensing an opportunity to take Caponigro's north New Jersey rackets, lied to Caponigro and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the Commission's support. On March 21, 1980, Bruno was shot {{in the back of the}} head while in his car by a gunman working for Caponigro. That April, Caponigro visited New York City under the assumption that he was going to be confirmed as boss. Instead, he was tortured and murdered for killing a Commission member without permission. Caponigro's co-conspirators Frank Sindone and John Simone were also murdered in 1980.|$|E

25|$|Sister Jude {{spends the}} {{evening in the}} motel diner, where she sees Shachath waiting for her. Sister Jude knows her to be the Angel of Death, but {{questions}} her about why she has appeared now, instead of the many other times when she attempted suicide: the night her husband left her after she <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> infected her with syphilis, leaving her barren, or the night she committed the hit-and-run. Shachath tells her that the other times, she still had hope and purpose, but now she is willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one last thing. She visits {{the parents of the}} girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She is intent on telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that she had in fact survived the accident. Sister Jude is stunned and the parents recount that they never learned who was responsible, but have made peace with it.|$|E
25|$|He had {{a fairly}} slow start to his racing career, using {{his own money}} to help work his way up the ranks. After {{considerable}} success in kart racing, he moved to the Formula Ford series to the disapproval of his father. In 1976, Mansell won six of the nine races he took part in, including his debut event at Mallory Park. He entered 42 races the following year and won 33 to become the 1977 British Formula Ford champion, despite suffering a broken neck in a qualifying session at Brands Hatch. Doctors <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been perilously close to quadriplegia, that he would be confined for six months and would never drive again. Mansell discharged himself from the hospital and returned to racing. Three weeks before the accident he had resigned from his job as an aerospace engineer, having previously sold most of his personal belongings to finance his foray into Formula Ford. Later that year he was given the chance to race a Lola T570 Formula 3 car at Silverstone. He finished fourth and decided that he was ready to move into the higher formula.|$|E
25|$|Sergei Diaghilev {{was born}} to a wealthy and cultured family in Selishchi (Novgorod Governorate), Russia; his father, Pavel Pavlovich, was a cavalry colonel, but the family's money came mainly from vodka distilleries. After the death of Sergei's mother, his father married Elena Valerianovna Panaeva, an artistic {{young woman who was}} on very affectionate terms with her stepson and was a strong {{influence}} on him. The family lived in Perm but had an apartment in Saint Petersburg and a country estate in Bikbarda (near Perm). In 1890, Sergei's parents went bankrupt, having for a long time lived beyond their means, and from that time Sergei (who had a small income inherited from his mother) had to support the family. After graduating from Perm gymnasium in 1890, he went to the capital to study law at St. Petersburg University, but ended up also taking classes at the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music, where he studied singing and music (a love of which he had picked up from his stepmother). After graduating in 1892 he abandoned his dreams of composition (his professor, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no talent for music).|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, {{complaining}} of back pains and other discomfort.

Afterwards, Levin said, Jacobs <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "got a couple of jukes [...] in."

500|$|Comstock {{threatened}} Ortiz {{with legal}} action, and the manager– unaware that Comstock could not arrest him, and fearful {{that he could}} cause trouble for the gallery– was initially frightened.

The following day, the controversy was highly covered in the press, who hailed Ortiz as [...] "one art expert with the courage to stand up against Comstock and his dictatorship". Following Comstock's visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling September Morn. The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of September Morn, {{so that it could}} remain in his window.|$|E
