5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), {{having left}} Dunder Mifflin with Pam (Jenna Fischer) to form his own company, {{is having trouble}} {{starting}} his first day {{as president of the}} Michael Scott Paper Company. Pam tries to keep things together and suggests they create a list of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to maintain a positive working atmosphere. Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company. He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company. Michael and Pam leave to find potential salesmen and then have their meeting with the potential investor.|$|E

In June, July and August, the Grammy-nominated Grant Park Orchestra and Chorus performs free classical concerts at the Grant Park Music Festival. The festival, a Chicago tradition since 1931, remains the nation's only free, outdoor classical music series. Although the Music Festival shares pavilion space with several other program series and annual performances, its concerts most Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings throughout {{the heart of the}} summer are the core of the pavilion's offerings. Travel guide Frommer's lists the park, pavilion, and these free concerts as some of the best free <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in Chicago.

25|$|The game's {{story is}} often mapped onto exploration, where each {{chapter of the}} story is mapped onto a {{different}} location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left to do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth of}} eSports in South Korea {{is thought to}} have been {{influenced}} by the mass building of broadband internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> while out of work. Instrumental to this growth of eSports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate eSports in the country.|$|E

25|$|In {{the post}} {{apartheid}} South Africa, {{construction of new}} schools in poorer townships often failed to include the construction of both indoor and outdoor sporting facilities. There might be some space set aside for a netball court or a soccer field, though {{that may be the}} only substitute available. The problems of getting facilities for women's sports like netball is still difficult because of Zulu gender constructions, where men are the dominant cultural force. Some schools in coloured areas do not offer physical education classes. To address this need, they have school teams. Most schools only offer netball for girls, soccer for boys and athletics for both genders. For coloured children, boys rank sport as the most important for <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in their free time. In contrast, coloured girls rank playing sport as fourth in their list of priorities.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened, on {{the same}} date that Mediaset's La Cinq (unrelated to the resort) ceased transmissions. Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A {{government}} survey indicated that {{half a million people}} carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct RER railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible. Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.|$|E
25|$|Security at Los Alamos {{was very}} tight by {{standards}} of the time. The site was an uninhabited desert location (formerly a private school) whose perimeter was fenced, with guards at the gates. The scientists were permitted outside the facility {{but there was little}} available transportation. (Since they were not members of the military, they could not be ordered to comply with military secrecy orders and instead voluntarily agreed to abide by them.) Although urban-raised scientists, like Ashkin, were far from the amusements that cities afford, they were able to find amusing <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It helped that some of the married ones were able to bring their wives to live in the town of Los Alamos and thus parties of men and women could get together for social activities. These include such things as hikes of hills and canyons of the surrounding wilderness areas. It's likely Ashkin played outdoor team sports while at Los Alamos. A Met Lab colleague remembered playing touch football with him and Feld on an open space called the midway at the University of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has other <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, {{and the system}} is undermined when {{any one of the}} divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E
