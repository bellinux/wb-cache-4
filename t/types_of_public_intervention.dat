40|$|Despite {{the growing}} role of private {{involvement}} in recent port developments, most maritime trade is still largely handled in ports where investments, pricing and other managerial decisions are, to a varying extent, dependent, {{or at least}} influenced by public bodies. This paper shows that the extent and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> differs considerably between ports in the Hamburg-Le Havre range. The wide variety in ownership, financing and management of ports throughout Europe indicates {{that there is no}} level playing field at present. Because ports operate in an increasingly competitive environment (intensified by globalisation trends and the completion of the internal market), this may lead to situations of unfair competition. The European Union emphasises the importance of a more harmonised approach of port regulation by national governments (in terms of financing and pricing of infrastructure). Given the differences in (national) port management styles and the low levels of transparency, the creation of a level playing field in the European port industry seems far away. This suggests the presence of a major institutional difference in European transport policy that hampers efficient policy intervention...|$|R

40|$|JEL classification: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{different}} forms of economic regulation in the network industries, following the debate about restructuring these industries. The main theories on (economic) regulation of the network industries are presented and the most important regulatory instruments available to regulators are identified. Several regulatory theories were developed over the past decades proposing different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> in the market, and up to a certain extent influencing the nature of the reform process. Depending on the region, this process is characterised by the privatisation and/or the liberalisation of network industries. Even in situations where it is difficult to introduce competition, some theories explore alternative mechanisms to overcome this limitation, which consequently influences regulation. In practice, deregulation in the network industries pertains essentially to command-and-control types of regulation, and not all the types of intervention in the market. In reality, instead of complete deregulation, there has been a move towards different types of intervention (a process also known as re-regulation), with a special emphasis on incentive regulation...|$|E

This article, drawn from a longer study, offers a framework for deter-mining the appropriate roles <b>of</b> the <b>public</b> and private sectors in delivering ani-mal health services, such as veterinary surveillance, disease vector control, vaccination, clinical treatment of sick animals, inspection of livestock products, and veterinary research and extension. The profitability and therefore the supply of private veterinary services is gov-erned by several factors arising from economies of scale, such as the size of the livestock enterprises in the locality, the nature of potential or actual diseases, and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> animals raised in the production systems. Thus, in areas where pri-vate veterinary work is unprofitable or where other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> market failure oc-cur, economic or social concerns may make some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> nec-essary.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{nature of}} agricultural production processes induce {{a higher degree}} of uncertainty surrounding the economic performance of farm enterprises. This has contributed to the development and acceptance <b>of</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> aimed at reducing income variability that have no parallel in other sectors of the economy. In particular, subsidized crop insurance are a widely used tool. The impact of these programs on the decisions of production generates effects on input use, land use and thus, indirectly, environmental outcomes. The importance of this issue has grown in parallel with the growth in importance of the collective role of agriculture sector that has addressed the recent guidelines adopted by many developed countries. To examine the effects <b>of</b> <b>public</b> risk management programs on optimal nitrogen fertilizer use and land allocation to crops, this study carried out an empirical analysis by developing a mathematical programming model of a representative wheat-tomato farm in Apulia southern region of Italy. The model endogenizes nitrogen fertilizer rates and land allocation, as well as the insurance coverage levels, participation in insurance programs and the Environmental Payment (EP). This study utilized direct expected utility maximizing non-linear programming in combination with a simulation approach. Results show that with current crop insurance programs, the optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate slightly increases and the optimal acreage substantially increases for tomato whereas decrease for wheat.

40|$|Housing {{provisions}} {{by public}} agencies for low-income people present a dismal picture in most developing countries. The reasons are typically scarce resources and adoption of high standards, which {{result in a}} limited supply of complete dwelling units, inappropriate {{in their use of}} resources and, at the same time, not responsive to the occupants' needs and priorities. This study puts forward that, in the context <b>of</b> India, <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> (which include governmental and other agencies) have not only had limited success in providing housing, but have tended to neglect the impacts the housing programs and projects have on a local area. The study examines the policies and programs at both the overall and local level, using case-studies to illustrate different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> generally in India, and specifically within East Calcutta. The study is outlined in four parts. The first part deals with describing the overall situation of housing policies in India and development policies of East Calcutta. The second part looks at the local context in detail, documenting its characteristics, and describing through three case-studies the impact of these interventions on the settlements. It illustrates the major impacts that <b>public</b> <b>interventions</b> have had on settlement formation, user- involvement in dwelling provision and security of tenure. The third part elaborates the reasons for wanting to know about the impacts and a process for documenting them. The emphasis is on understanding hard-to- measure qualitative impacts rather than quantifiable ones. The last part summarizes the range of issues and impacts and presents the findings about the hypotheses that were put forward initially.

40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} modes road, rail, air and maritime {{differ in}} terms of how innovations are developed and brought to the market. These differences suggest that the role of policy environment and policy support to stimulate such innovations varies between the modes. The objective of the paper is to extend existing analyses of the innovation systems of all modes and to compare them with regard to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> required to foster the innovativeness of a mode and potentially also to gain/increase lead market effects by the public support. The research builds on innovation system analysis though this focuses either on technological innovation systems (TIS) or national innovation systems (NIS). In contrast we propose a kind of sectoral innovation systems (SIS) for which few examples exist. We extend the analysis of SIS by findings from the German High Tech Strategy on future markets and transport technologies that confirm by analysis patents and publications that the EU is a leader in transport technology innovation. However, {{this is not the case}} for all modes and the reasons seem to emerge from the supply and demand side of the markets. Therefore the European and Global markets are also compared across modes. The analysis differentiates innovations in vehicle technologies and infrastructures. For the vehicle technologies the conclusion on how innovations emerge is the following:•road vehicles: private initiative and funding, stimulated by regulation;•rail vehicles: dominated by public institutions in particular on demand sides, hampered by limited markets but globally future market growth is expected;•air planes: mixed private/public markets in which innovation is stimulated by market expectations and safety requirements;•ships: private markets in which innovation is hampered by limited regulations. The market analysis suggests that concerning vehicles in particular <b>public</b> <b>intervention</b> related to the rail mode could be required to foster innovations. To a lesser extent this holds for the ship sector as well. In terms of infrastructures the combination of infrastructures with IT technologies seems to be the field most interesting for <b>public</b> <b>intervention.</b> European transport policy prioritizing rail and ship mode and requiring technical standards or performance standards may enable that in these modes innovativeness is increased such that additional innovations would be generated and lead market effects could be nurtured...|$|R

At a conceptual level, the analysis establishes that Gini-style indices can be brought to bear on economic models, only if the ordering of geographic areas required to give Gini-coefficient values internal technical coherence also has meaning in terms of the conceptual predictions of the modelling. This, in turn, implies that Gini-indices are most likely to prove useful for fairly aggregated forms of economic analysis, involving relatively few and large geographic divisions. At an applied level, the analysis establishes that one particular geographic distribution of health practitioners is empirically dominant, and that is the distribution which involves the lowest practitioner: population ratio in rural areas, and the highest ratio in large urban areas, with the ratio for small urban areas in between. The empirical evidence also suggests that the spatial practitioner distributions are highly stable for most kinds of health personnel, making it problematic whether these distributions can be changed through normal <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> policy <b>interventions.</b> Gini-coefficient manpower distributions doctor-population ratios spatial modelling health practitioners Alberta...|$|R

Here, we compare the benefits <b>of</b> such <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health <b>interventions.</b> Methods We used multi-state life table methods to estimate the impact <b>of</b> five <b>types</b> <b>of</b> interventions on mortality, morbidity (years of life in fair or poor health), and years of healthy life (years in excellent, very good, or good health). Results A one-shot intervention that makes all the sick persons healthy at baseline would increase life expectancy by 3 months and increase years of healthy life by 6 months, in a cohort beginning at age 65. An equivalent amount of improvement can be obtained from an intervention that either decreases the probability of getting sick each year by 12 %, increases the probability of a sick person recovering by 16 %, decreases the probability that a sick person dies by 15 %, or decreases the probability that a healthy person dies by 14 %. Interventions aimed at keeping persons healthy increased longevity and years of healthy life, while decreasing morbidity and medical expenditures.

With reference to an ongoing debate in the literature and within public health organisations, this study reviews current experience with the GRADE approach in rating the quality of evidence in the field <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health and identifies challenges encountered. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals/groups that have applied the GRADE approach {{in the context of}} systematic reviews or guidelines in the field <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health, as well as with representatives of groups or organisations that actively decided against its use. We initially contacted potential participants by email. Responses were obtained by telephone interview or email, and written interview summaries were validated with participants. We analysed data across individual interviews to distil common themes and challenges. Results Based on 25 responses, we undertook 18 interviews and obtained 15 in-depth responses relating to specific systematic reviews or guideline projects; a majority of the latter were contributed by groups within the World Health Organization. All respondents that have used the GRADE approach appreciated the systematic and transparent process of assessing the quality of the evidence. However, respondents reported a range of minor and major challenges relating to complexity <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health <b>interventions,</b> choice <b>of</b> outcomes and outcome measures, ability to discriminate between different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> observational studies, use of non-epidemiological evidence, GRADE terminology and the GRADE and guideline development process. Respondents’ suggestions to make the approach more applicable to <b>public</b> health <b>interventions</b> included revisiting terminology, offering better guidance on how to apply GRADE to complex interventions and making modifications to the current grading scheme. Conclusions Our findings suggest that GRADE principles are applicable to public health and well-received but also highlight common challenges. They provide a starting point for exploring options for improvements and, where applicable, testing these across different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> health <b>interventions.</b> Several <b>public</b> health organisations are currently testing GRADE, and the GRADE Working Group is eager to engage with these groups to find ways to address concerns. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} public {{research and development}} (R&D) subsidies to support private firms doing innovative activities and quantitative impact evaluation of the policy on total factor productivity (TFP) change and additional R&D effort. Public R&D subsidization as a public R&D policy, beside different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interventions,</b> has been widely used by governments to stimulate private R&D. These policies aim {{to fill the gap}} between the private and social rates of returns by encouraging business enterprises to spend on additional R&D, produce more innovation output and inventions, or change their innovative behavior. These changes can be carried out either individually or in collaboration with other entities. One ultimate goal of R&D policy is increasing the total factor productivity and relative performance both at firm and aggregate levels. This study deals with direct place-based public R&D subsidies and empirically measures the effects <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> incentives on productivity growth and R&D input additionality. In order to evaluate the policy effect, a quasi-experimental counterfactual setting for subsidized (treated) and non-subsidized (non-treated) firms can be framed thank to the characteristics and mechanism of the local R&D program in the Province of Trento in Italy. The average treatment effect of the policy on target variables is measured for subsidized units (Average treatment effect on treated: ATET) and for the whole population of the firms (Average treatment effect: ATE), using techniques capable of tackling the problems of endogeneity and selection bias which arise in empirical evaluation studies. Propensity score matching (PSM) and structural modeling methodologies are used to measure the effects of the R&D subsidies on target variables, TFP change and additional R&D expenditure, respectively. The former approach is non-parametric and does not assume a functional form for the effect of policy on R&D and productivity change, while the latter models the optimizing behavior of the firm (agent) and the public agency, searching for an equilibrium in a pre-determined game theoretical framework. Although the PSM method takes advantage of no pre-defined structure assumption, however and in contrary, the structural model with simultaneous equations, takes into account the effect of unobservables on subsidized firms’ selection procedure, beside R&D spillovers effect. In order to design the evaluation framework to estimate ATE and ATET on the target variable of interest (TFP change), we have built a firm-level panel dataset (maximum 5 years of information) constructed by combination and merge of datasets related to public (provincial) R&D policy, firms’ characteristics, firms’ R&D activities and TFP change measures. The time span of the dataset allows us to capture the effects in both short-term and long run, consequently tracing the short and long term effects of the R&D program. This helps us to consider the usual longer effect lag an innovation policy entails, specifically on a target variable such as productivity and a treatment such as innovation incentive, which the effects may take time to be realized in comparison with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> outcomes and investment policies. The dataset represents the outcome of a long process of combining and merging various datasets related to firms’ financial statements and balance sheet (AIDA: Italian company information and business intelligence) and APIAE’s R&D policy information provided by ISPAT. TFP change and its decompositions, technical efficiency change and technological frontier change are realized using Malmquist Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. DEA takes a system approach towards the firm as decision making unit (DMU) and only applies the input(s) and output(s) measures to calculate the relative (in) efficiency of the firms. Malmquist method based on index theory, captures the (in) efficiency change and the technological frontier movement within a time interval. TFP change measures are calculated by CRS output-oriented DEA dual model using a new package introduced in STATA software and merged into the reference dataset described previously. To sum up, after the formation and construction of dataset by combining and merging different datasets, treatment effect analysis is carried out using PSM nearest neighbor and kernel estimators. The balancing property satisfaction on pre-treatment observable factors (age and size in our setting) is primarily investigated and propensity distribution graphs have been also provided. Taking into account the dataset features, R&D subsidies effect is measured for manufacturing and ICT industries (using 4 techniques to measure both ATE and ATET), beside low-medium technology and high-tech industries classifications (Both ATE and ATET). Moreover, the subsidies effect on TFP measures have also been measured for different categories of selection procedures. Results show heterogenous and mixed effect of R&D subsidies based on different settings of evaluation (sectors and selection categories), targeted outcome, PSM method (different PSM algorithms for nearest neighbor and kernel) and time of the effect (short-term or long run). The complete results have been discussed in detail in the related sections in chapter three. To address the effect of unobservable factors, beside spillover effect on R&D subsidies allocation and the effect on outcome, a structural model is estimated using a cross-sectional dataset. The dataset is formed by merging R&D policy-related (linked to Provincial Law LP 6 / 99 enforced by provincial agency for the promotion of economic activities :APIAE) dataset and firms’ determinants provided by ISPAT (Statistical institute of Province of Trento). This approach complements the drawbacks due to estimation using PSM methodology. However, the pre-defined functional form for equations is a limitation of this approach. The structural model applied includes application decision, selection (subsidies allocation) and R&D investment equations to be turned into econometric equations for empirical estimation. The context and dataset features allow for different empirical modifications with respect to the benchmark model applied. The results determine the effect of firm (project) characteristics on all stages of the subsidization game. Size, age, exporting status, board size and sector are main factors being investigated. The results show not only there is no additional R&D expenditure, but also some crowding out of subsidies occurs. The base model is determined in such a format which makes it possible to evaluate the spillover effect and spillover rate of R&D spending as well. The results show that on average half (50...|$|R

This study assessed the proportion and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> published <b>public</b> health <b>intervention</b> research papers {{over time in}} physical activity and falls prevention, both important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality. Methods A keyword search was conducted, using Medline and PsycINFO to locate publications in 1988 - 1989, 1998 - 1999, and 2008 - 2009 for the two topic areas. In stage 1, {{a random sample of}} 1200 publications per time period for both topics were categorized as: non-public health, non-data-based public health, or data-based public health. In stage 2 data-based public health articles were further classified as measurement, descriptive, etiological or intervention research. Finally, intervention papers were categorized as: efficacy, intervention replication or dissemination studies. Inter-rater reliability of paper classification was 88 %. Results Descriptive studies were the most common data-based papers across all time periods (1988 - 89; 1998 - 1999; 2008 - 2009) for both issues (physical activity: 47 %; 54 %; 65 % and falls 75 %; 64 %; 63 %), increasing significantly over time for physical activity. The proportion of intervention publications did not increase over time for physical activity comprising 23 % across all time periods and fluctuated for falls across the time periods (10 %; 21 %; 17 %). The proportion of intervention articles that were replication studies increased over the three time periods for physical activity (0 %; 2 %; 11 %) and for falls (0 %; 22 %; 35 %). Dissemination studies first appeared in the literature in 2008 - 2009, making up only 3 % of physical activity and 7 % of falls intervention studies. Conclusions Intervention research studies remain only a modest proportion of all published studies in physical activity and falls prevention; the majority of the intervention studies, are efficacy studies although there is growing evidence of a move towards replication and dissemination studies, which may have greater potential for improving population health. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background : This study {{examines}} {{factors that are}} more associated with risk of sexually transmitted bacterial and viral diseases in {{a representative sample of}} American adults. Methods : This is a cross sectional study using secondary data from the 2007 - 2010 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) is the software used in analysis of descriptive data and logistic regression models. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between risk factors and sexually transmitted diseases. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between risk factors and sexually transmitted diseases while controlling for confounders. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was to determine the best predictors <b>of</b> each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> sexually transmitted diseases. Results : The sample size for the study population is n= 9, 216. There were four observed risk factors that were significantly associated with both bacterial sexually transmitted diseases as well as viral sexually transmitted diseases at the 0. 05 level of probability. Lack of health insurance was associated with 1. 66 increased odds of sexually transmitted viral disease compared to 1. 55 increased odds seen in sexually transmitted bacterial disease. History of birth control was associated with 2. 61 and 1. 66 increased odds in sexually transmitted bacterial disease and sexually transmitted viral disease, respectively. Having first sexual encounter in adulthood was associated with 3. 01 increased odds in sexually transmitted bacterial disease and 1. 72 times increased odds in sexually transmitted viral diseases. Multiple sexual partners was associated with decreased odds in both sexually transmitted bacterial and viral sexually transmitted diseases. Conclusions : The results of this study indicating differences in factors that are associated with sexually transmitted bacteria diseases and sexually transmitted viral diseases provide evidence for developing <b>public</b> health <b>intervention</b> that is based on <b>type</b> <b>of</b> infection. <b>Public</b> health <b>intervention</b> programs that address sex education, effect of IV drug use, the importance of health insurance, the use of birth control, circumcision, and smoking cessation may help to curb the prevalence of both sexually transmitted bacterial and viral infections in at-risk groups...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{a growing body of}} {{literature}} within health economics has provided evidence of the impact of fetal conditions on individual’s health and economic outcomes over the entire life course. This dissertation contributes to the field of health economics by investigating the effects <b>of</b> two distinct <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> policies, antimalarial <b>interventions</b> in sub-Saharan Africa and medical marijuana laws in the United States, on early-life health. Chapter 1 adds to the increased understanding of the impact of in utero exposure to large-scale interventions to combat endemic diseases by examining the effects of antimalarial interventions aimed at preventing and controlling malaria in pregnancy on birth outcomes. Since the year 2000, a coordinated international effort against malaria has led to a significant scale-up of intervention coverage across sub-Saharan Africa. One of the objectives of this undertaking was to improve maternal and early-life health. This chapter investigates the effect of access to malaria prevention and control measures, including insecticide-treated nets, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy, indoor residual spraying, and artemisinin-based combination therapy, on birth weight. I exploit the geographic and time variation in the rollout of antimalarial interventions in sub-Saharan Africa across regions with different levels of initial malaria prevalence to analyze 277, 245 live births in 22 countries from 2000 to 2013 in a continuous difference-in-differences estimation framework and find that the diffusion of intermittent preventive treatment among pregnant women contributed to the reduction of low birth weight incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. I do not find other antimalarial interventions to be associated with significant improvements in birth outcomes. Chapter 2 provides an investigation focused on examining the impact of medical marijuana laws in the United States on birth outcomes. As of June 2017, medical marijuana laws which liberalize the cultivation, possession, and use of cannabis for allowable medical purposes have been adopted by 29 states and the District of Columbia. The expansion of state-level legislation allowing for medical marijuana use has fueled an ongoing debate regarding drug policy. Despite a growing interest in investigating and quantifying both direct and indirect effects of marijuana liberalization policies, little is known about how they affect early-life health. Using data on the entire universe of births in the U. S. between 1990 and 2013 and a difference-in-differences research design, I find no evidence to support the hypothesis that medical marijuana laws {{have a negative impact on}} birth weight and gestation, however I also find that medical marijuana laws are associated with reductions in Apgar scores...|$|R
