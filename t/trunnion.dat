5|$|Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, <b>trunnion</b> bascule bridge. It was {{engineered}} by the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy {{the chief engineer}} of construction. At the time of construction it {{was believed to be}} the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.|$|E
5|$|Route 3 {{crosses the}} Passaic River {{on a fixed}} bridge, which {{replaced}} a double-leaf <b>trunnion</b> bascule bridge in 2013, into Rutherford, Bergen County. Just after crossing the river, the route interchanges with County Route 507 (Riverside Avenue). The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17. Past this interchange, Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17, which continues {{to the north of}} Route 3.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved <b>trunnion</b> bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|Mark 1, Nos. 1-4, Mod 0, {{consisted}} of a tube, jacket, 19 hoops and an elevating band with integral <b>trunnions.</b> The Mod 1 had no <b>trunnions</b> and were not hooped to the muzzle. They weighed , without the breech, with a barrel length of [...] bore (30 calibers).|$|R
50|$|The Confederates did {{solid cast}} 8-inch and 10-inch columbiads that {{resemble}} Rodman guns. A closer examination of these Confederate columbiads reveals {{that they have}} a straighter cylindrical contour between the <b>trunnions</b> and the breech as opposed to the sweeping continuous curve of the Rodman gun. The Confederate columbiads have longer <b>trunnions</b> that were intended for use with heavy wooden carriages. The Union gun were designed to be mounted in iron carriages with thinner cheeks, permitting shorter <b>trunnions.</b> The exteriors of the Confederate columbiads are rough, not having been finished on a lathe as were their Union counterparts.|$|R

5|$|The Grand Street Bridge {{opened for}} traffic in 1919, {{but had to}} be closed in 1932 after the {{southeast}} pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As {{a part of the}} renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest <b>trunnion</b> post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Street Bridge was a {{double-leaf}} deck-girder {{bascule bridge}} in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States, that spanned the Pequonnock River and connected Grand Street and Artic Street. It {{was one of}} three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 {{at the request of the}} War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the floor was replaced with a steel grate on I-beam floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest <b>trunnion</b> post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.|$|E

50|$|Gun {{carriages}} {{were introduced}} in the 15th century. Two large-diameter wheels, axle-tree and a trail became the standard pattern for field use. The barrel was mounted in a wooden cradle with <b>trunnions</b> to mount it on the carriage. As technology improved, the <b>trunnions</b> {{became part of the}} barrel and the cradle was abandoned. Nevertheless, they were relatively large and heavy.|$|R
5000|$|In a cannon, the <b>trunnions</b> are two {{projections}} cast just {{forward of}} the center of mass of the cannon and fixed to a two-wheeled movable gun carriage. [...] As they allowed the muzzle to be raised and lowered easily, the integral casting of <b>trunnions</b> is seen by military historians {{as one of the most}} important advances in early field artillery.|$|R

25|$|Ericson {{was removed}} from the Public Works' bridge {{division}} and control over bridge design was passed to a separate administrative entity headed by Thomas G. Pihlfeldt. However, under Pihlfeldt's guidance the city continued to express preference for the <b>trunnion</b> bascule design.|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} large number of lightweight, {{corrosion-resistant}} synthetic materials in its design; the receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire control selector and firing mechanism parts), magazine well, handguard and carry handle are all made of a carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel <b>trunnion</b> (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66 steel reinforced receiver.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Chicago River was {{constructed}} over the North Branch near the present day Kinzie Street in 1832. A second bridge, over the South Branch near Randolph Street, was added in 1833. The first moveable bridge was constructed across the main stem at Dearborn Street in 1834. Today, the Chicago River has 38 movable bridges spanning it, down {{from a peak of}} 52 bridges. These bridges are of several different types, including <b>trunnion</b> bascule, Scherzer rolling lift, swing bridges, and vertical lift bridges.|$|E

5000|$|The carronade, {{like other}} naval guns, was mounted with ropes to {{restrain}} the recoil, but {{the details of the}} gun mounting were usually quite different. The carronade was typically mounted on a sliding rather than a wheeled gun carriage, and elevation was achieved with a turnscrew, like field guns, rather than the [...] (wooden wedges) usual for naval guns. In addition, a carronade was usually mounted on a lug underneath the barrel, rather than the usual <b>trunnions</b> to either side. As a result, the carronade had an unusually high centre of gravity. Towards the end of the period of use, some carronades were fitted with <b>trunnions</b> to lower their centres of gravity, to create a variant known as the [...] "gunnade". Gunnades, introduced around 1820, are distinct from the earliest carronades, which also featured <b>trunnions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term is {{also used}} to {{describe}} the wheel that a rotating cylinder runs on. For example, a lapidary (stone-polishing) cylinder runs on a pair of rollers, similar to <b>trunnions.</b> The sugar industry uses rotating cylinders up to 22 ft in diameter, 131 ft long, and weighing around 1,000 tons. These rotate at around 30 revolutions per hour. They are supported on a pathring, which runs on <b>trunnions.</b> Similar devices called rotary kilns are used in cement manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|During the {{construction}} of the first prototype, there was a problem discovered with some American-made rivets which delayed the roll-out to 4 July 2007 along with its cousin aircraft P-X (since designated as the P-1). During structural testing, deformation of the XP-1 / XC-2 horizontal stabiliser was found, as well as cracking in the XC-2 undercarriage <b>trunnion</b> structure and parts of the fuselage; the cracking problem was reportedly difficult to address. The C-X program was embroiled in further controversy when allegations that bribery had been involved in the purchase of five General Electric CF6-80C2 engines, used to power the aircraft, were made by prosecutors.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, {{the city}} had {{obtained}} permission to issue bonds to replace {{the rest of the}} swing bridges on the Chicago River. Ericson sent the Scherzer Company and the Sanitary District specifications for the bridge in 1905. A design by John W. Page, the inventor of a bascule bridge over the Sanitary and Ship Canal, was rejected in March 1905 due to noncompliance to specifications. The Scherzer Company waited until the bidding deadline to submit two separate designs; both of these were also rejected due to noncompliance. Two contracts were bid out for the <b>trunnion</b> style bascule bridge that Ericson had pioneered; one contract for $81,369 (1905) went to the Jackson and Corbett Company for the substructure, and one for $111,983 (1905) went to the Roemheld and Gallery Company for superstructure work.|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge is}} {{designed}} to carry two railroad tracks across the river. Its superstructure consists of two spans constructed by the Strauss Bascule & Concrete Bridge Company: a [...] plate-girder span {{on the west bank}} of the river and the [...] movable main span that rests on the east <b>trunnion</b> pier. The size and weight of the main span, which, when completed would be world's longest and heaviest bascule span, required the <b>trunnion</b> pier to be constructed on foundations that extend to the bedrock [...] below the river bed. To achieve this caissons were sunk to a depth of [...] below the river bed and then [...] diameter wells were sunk the remaining [...] The substructure of the bridge was constructed by the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted <b>trunnions</b> and some have table-mounted <b>trunnions.</b> In general, cabinet-mounted <b>trunnions</b> are easier to adjust than table-mounted <b>trunnions.</b> Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|R

500|$|As {{with the}} South Carolina class, these ships were fitted with two 3-inch/50 caliber {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns in Mark 11 mounts in 1917. The Mark 11 mount {{was the first}} 3-inch AA mounting issued by the US Navy. They had a <b>trunnion</b> height of [...] compared to a height of [...] for the pedestal mountings used against surface craft. This allowed them an elevation range between −10 and 85 degrees. Maximum range was [...] at 43 degrees and maximum ceiling [...] at 85 degrees.|$|E
500|$|The Michigan Avenue Bridge (officially DuSable Bridge) is a {{bascule bridge}} that carries Michigan Avenue across the main stem of the Chicago River in {{downtown}} Chicago, Illinois, United States. The bridge was {{proposed in the}} early 20th century {{as part of a}} plan to link Chicago's south side and north side parks with a grand boulevard. Construction of the bridge started in 1918, it opened to traffic in 1920, and decorative work was completed in 1928. The bridge provides passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels; it {{is an example of a}} fixed <b>trunnion</b> bascule bridge, which is also known as a [...] "Chicago style bascule bridge". The bridge is included in the Michigan–Wacker Historic District and has been designated as a Chicago Landmark.|$|E
500|$|George Willard, a young {{reporter}} for the Winesburg Eagle, figures prominently in much of Winesburg, Ohio. Throughout the book, he plays the dual role of listener and recorder of other people's stories and advice, and the young representative of the town's hopes whose coming-of-age reaches its dénouement in the final tale, [...] "Departure", when George leaves Winesburg for the city. Much of George's story is centered around two interconnected threads: those of his sexual and artistic maturation. Most of the time, these two formative elements proceed together; it is solely when George loses his virginity to Louise <b>Trunnion</b> in [...] "Nobody Knows" [...] that the adventure is exclusively sexual. Afterwards, starting with his desire {{to fall in love}} with Helen White in order to have material for a love story in [...] "The Thinker", the desire for sexual fulfillment becomes linked to his literary/emotional sensibility.|$|E

500|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. [...] and Hereward saw {{the introduction of a}} new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the [...] through to the [...] of 1944. This was necessary as Hereward was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had a <b>trunnion</b> height [...] higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman to see over the top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic wedge shape with a sloping roof.|$|E
500|$|The {{cylindrical}} piers of {{the bridge}} were [...] in diameter and finished with an ashlar of cut granite. The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on trunnions located [...] {{from the end of}} the girders. The bridge's reinforced-concrete counterweights, measuring [...] high by [...] wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The trunnions were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside <b>trunnion</b> posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.|$|E
2500|$|Opened in January 1891, {{the first}} Madison Street Bridge was a swing bridge which pivoted {{on a large}} central <b>trunnion</b> mounted on a piling {{structure}} in the river.
