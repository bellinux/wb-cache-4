5|$|According to Blythe's {{attorney}} Martin Radvan, {{the police}} launched an investigation {{following the death}} of Nosek, about a month after the concert and following a coma. After interviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert, the police asked the United States Department of Justice {{to take part in the}} investigation; however, they refused <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and,</b> moreover, did not notify anyone from Lamb of God or its management.|$|E
5|$|Cormier {{was known}} for his {{physical}} strength and intense exercise regimen. He was known to bench press 450 pounds with each, and he was once recorded as bench pressing 527 pounds. During one photo session, Cormier lifted a telephone pole from the ground and carried it around while posing for pictures.

5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} {{understanding}} with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> mutually provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions. The pact neutralized the Habsburg Monarchy {{in regard to}} the Commonwealth's war with Russia, but had resulted in more serious consequences after the Bohemian Revolt gave rise to the Thirty Years' War in 1618.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of July 1919, the General Syrian Congress (GSC) held its first meeting in Damascus and Darwaza was its secretary. The GSC called for the {{immediate}} independence of Syria as a sovereign state under a constitutional monarchy and underlined its opposition to the establishment of Zionism in southern Syria (Palestine). Along with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Aref al-Aref, Darwaza founded and became an officer of the Palestinian Society in Damascus. The organization urged all societies and clubs in Palestine <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> condemn the San Remo Conference's decision to grant Great Britain a mandate over Palestine and Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Japanese crackdowns {{on these}} guerrillas in Luzon were {{widespread}} and brutal. The Japanese Army, Kempeitai and Filipino collaborators hunted down resistance fighters and anyone associated with them. One example happened to resistance leader Wenceslao Vinzons; {{leader of the}} successful guerilla movement in Bicol. After being betrayed to the Japanese by a Japanese collaborator, Vinzons was tortured to give up information on his resistance movement. Vinzons however, refused <b>to</b> <b>cooperate,</b> <b>and</b> he and his family, consisting of his father Gabino, his wife Liwayway, sister Milagros and children Aurora and Alexander, were bayoneted to death.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{has taken}} Rose to the Dalek. Rose takes pity on the {{creature}} and touches its casing; the Dalek absorbs her DNA and {{the remnants of}} time energy she has from traveling in the TARDIS, and re-energizes itself. It escapes its bonds, kills several guards, and connects to the Internet to learn {{it is the last}} surviving Dalek. With no other purpose, it proceeds to target and exterminate any non-Dalek life form. The Vault is locked-down, and while Adam escapes, Rose is trapped within. van Statten is forced to release the Doctor to help stop the Dalek, but the Dalek refuses <b>to</b> <b>cooperate,</b> <b>and</b> continues killing all those left in the Vault.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, the Edison and Swan {{companies}} {{merged into}} the Edison and Swan United Electric Company (later known as Ediswan, and ultimately incorporated into Thorn Lighting Ltd). Edison was initially against this combination, but after Swan sued him and won, Edison was eventually forced <b>to</b> <b>cooperate,</b> <b>and</b> the merger was made. Eventually, Edison acquired all of Swan's {{interest in the}} company. Swan sold his US patent rights to the Brush Electric Company in June 1882.|$|E

25|$|Economic demand {{influences}} {{the location of}} particular specialties. For example, more orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry {{are more likely to}} practice in high income areas. Small populations can usually only support primary care. A large population is needed to support specialists who treat rare diseases. Some specialties need <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> thus locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.|$|E
25|$|In 1809, Wellesley {{returned}} to Portugal with fresh forces, and defeated the French at the Second Battle of Porto, driving {{them from the}} country. He again advanced into Spain and fought the Battle of Talavera and the Battle of the Côa. He and the Spanish commanders were unable <b>to</b> <b>cooperate,</b> <b>and</b> he retreated into Portugal, where he constructed the defensive Lines of Torres Vedras which protected Lisbon, while he reorganised his Anglo-Portuguese Army into divisions, most of which had two British brigades and one Portuguese brigade.|$|E

Rockefeller had apparently {{learned a lot about}} Rogers' talents and negotiating skills during the South Improvement conflict. He quietly accepted the offer on the exact terms Rogers had laid out.

25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> opt out of bargaining.|$|E

There are services to help expedite the college admissions process, including a web-based service that sells copies of applications that gained the applicant admission to Ivy League colleges.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle also tried, {{largely in}} vain, {{to attract the}} support of French forces in the French Empire.

Noguès, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed {{to go along with}} it, refused <b>to</b> <b>cooperate</b> <b>and</b> forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle’s appeal. Noguès told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle’s attitude was “unseemly”. De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.|$|E
