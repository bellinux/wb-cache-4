40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH), Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have {{constructed}} long-term temperature {{records for}} deep atmospheric layers using satellite microwave sounding unit (MSU) and advanced microwave sounding unit (AMSU) observations.

This study evaluates {{the selection of the}} MSU TMT warm <b>target</b> <b>factor</b> for the NOAA- 9 satellite using five homogenized radiosonde products as references. The analysis reveals that the UAH TMT product has a positive bias of 0. 051 ± 0. 031 in the warm <b>target</b> <b>factor</b> that artificially reduces the global TMT trend by 0. 042 K decade − 1 for 1979 − 2009.

40|$|AbstractNascent polypeptides {{emerging}} from the ribosome are assisted by a pool of molecular chaperones and <b>targeting</b> <b>factors,</b> which enable them to efficiently partition as cytosolic, integral membrane or exported proteins. Extensive genetic and biochemical analyses have significantly expanded our knowledge of chaperone tasking throughout this process. In bacteria, {{it is known that}} the folding of newly-synthesized cytosolic proteins is mainly orchestrated by three highly conserved molecular chaperones, namely Trigger Factor (TF), DnaK (HSP 70) and GroEL (HSP 60). Yet, {{it has been reported that}} these major chaperones are strongly involved in protein translocation pathways as well. This review describes such essential molecular chaperone functions, with emphasis on both the biogenesis of inner membrane proteins and the post-translational targeting of presecretory proteins to the Sec and the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathways.

40|$|Proteins that {{perform their}} {{activity}} within the cytoplasmic membrane or outside this cell boundary must be targeted to the translocation site {{prior to their}} insertion and/or translocation. In bacteria, several targeting routes are known; the SecB- and the signal recognition particle-dependent pathways are the best characterized.

Proteins that use either one of these three different pathways possess special features that enable their specific interaction with the components of the targeting routes. Such targeting information is often contained in an N-terminal extension, the signal sequence, but can also be found within the mature domain of the targeted protein. Once the nascent chain starts to emerge from the ribosome, competition for the protein between different <b>targeting</b> <b>factors</b> begins. After recognition and binding, the <b>targeting</b> <b>factor</b> delivers the protein to the translocation sites at the cytoplasmic membrane.
