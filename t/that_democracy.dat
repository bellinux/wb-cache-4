He was certain <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> had reached its peak and Pericles' reforms were leading to the stalemate of populism. According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{spoke and}} {{voted in favor}} of the {{resolution}} of war requested by Wilson in April 1917 that plunged the United States into World War I. In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> had little place in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. The Mayflower Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the Mayflower upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> was the form of government mandated by God.|$|E
5000|$|Rummel's early {{research}} found <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> are less warlike, even against non-democracies. Many other researchers hold only <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> {{are far less}} warlike with one another. Some recent studies have supported Rummel's position.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{research}} is regarding the dyadic peace, <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> do not fight one another. Very few researchers {{have supported the}} monadic peace, <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> are more peaceful in general. There are some recent papers that find a slight monadic effect. Müller and Wolff (2004), in listing them, agree [...] "that democracies on average might be slightly, but not strongly, less warlike than other states," [...] but general [...] "monadic explanations is neither necessary nor convincing." [...] They note <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> have varied greatly in their belligerence against non-democracies.|$|R

5|$|The final Gallup poll {{before the}} {{election}} showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just {{before the election}}, Maclean's magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale {{the morning after the}} vote, editorializing <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have legally stayed in office until Diefenbaker could defeat him {{on the floor of the}} Commons. However, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with a Tory government, St. Laurent chose not to do so, making Diefenbaker Prime Minister-designate of Canada.|$|E

The new government executed him for treason in 1909.|$|E
25|$|One theory holds <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> {{requires}} three fundamental principles: (1) upward control, i.e. sovereignty residing at {{the lowest}} levels of authority, (2) political equality, and (3) social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality.|$|E

50|$|Michael Haas {{has written}} {{perhaps the most}} trenchant {{critique}} of a hidden normative agenda (Haas 1997). Among the points raised: Due to sampling manipulation, the research creates the impression <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> can justifiably fight nondemocracies, snuff out budding democracies, or even impose democracy. And due to sloppy definitions, there is no concern <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> continue undemocratic practices yet remain in the sample as if pristine democracies.|$|R
25|$|Always {{interested}} in {{independence from the}} British, Maududi lost faith in the Congress Party and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly Hindu identity. He began to turn more towards Islam, and believed <b>that</b> <b>Democracy</b> could be a viable option for Muslims only if the majority of Indians were Muslim.|$|E
25|$|On {{the issue}} of Islamic governance, Qutb {{differed}} with many modernist and reformist Muslims who claimed <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> was Islamic because the Quranic institution of Shura supported elections and democracy. Qutb {{pointed out that the}} Shura chapter of the Qur'an was revealed during the Mekkan period, and therefore, it does not deal with the problem of government. It makes no reference to elections and calls only for the ruler to consult some of the ruled, as a particular case of the general rule of Shura.|$|E
25|$|Some, such as Laurie Mylroie, suggest <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> and Islamic {{tradition}} are incompatible, and illiberal Islamists may {{be worse}} than the current authoritarian regimes (although she suggests {{it may be useful}} for the United States to promote human rights and democracy in certain parts of the Middle East to oppose dictators such as Saddam Hussein). Others stress the compatibility of democracy and the Islamic notion of shura, or consultation, and say that Western and international donors should not hesitate to promote democracy as a means of encouraging Arab democrats and responsible governance practices.|$|E
50|$|Plato {{rejected}} Athenian democracy on {{the basis}} <b>that</b> such <b>democracies</b> were anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> are unable to allow {{a sufficient number of}} their citizens to have their voices heard, and <b>that</b> such <b>democracies</b> were typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude <b>that</b> such <b>democracies</b> were a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.|$|R

25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} {{is based on}} the notion <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> is government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E
25|$|His leading {{views on}} {{democracy}} included: “First, Dewey believed <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> is an ethical ideal {{rather than merely}} a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making...Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society”. This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.|$|E
25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing {{the premise of the}} irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.|$|E
50|$|A further {{distinction}} <b>that</b> liberal <b>democracies</b> {{have rarely}} made war with one another; research has extended {{the theory and}} finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called militarized interstate disputes) causing fewer battle deaths with one another, and <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> have far fewer civil wars.|$|R
40|$|Democracies {{differ from}} autocracies in <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> produce stable, not high or low, growth in {{national}} income. We analyze the likely risk/return preferences of voters, and hypothesize {{that the underlying}} causal mechanism generating democratic stability is <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> more accurately reflect the risk aversion of ordinary citizens. We test our hypothesis in several ways. First, we reexamine three studies of comparative economic voting and find that voters penalize incumbents when economic volatility increases. Second, we use extreme bounds regression analyses to show <b>that</b> <b>democracies,</b> compared to autocracies, are characterized by less volatility in economic growth rates. Third, we find that democratic stability {{does not appear to}} arise because democracies ameliorate the effects of social cleavages, another mechanism that might explain democratic stability. When growth and volatility are jointly examined, democracies reveal highly favorable economic results...|$|R
25|$|Proponents of the {{controversial}} democratic peace theory claim that strong empirical evidence exists <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> never or rarely wage war against each other.|$|R
25|$|More recently, {{democracy}} is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected {{on and off}} there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.|$|E
25|$|From 1947 to 1959, the {{government}} was only partially stable. Seven prime ministers, four governors-general, and one president were forcefully removed either by constitutional coup or by military coup. The One Unit program was met with harsh opposition, civil unrest, and political disturbance. Support for the Muslim League and Pakistan Socialist Party in the upcoming elections threatened Pakistan's technocracy. The Muslim League and Socialist Party gained momentum after the League's defeat in the 1954 elections, and the Socialist Party were challenging for the constituencies of the President Iskandar Mirza's Republican Party. Relations with the United States deteriorated, with the US assessing <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> in both states was failing.|$|E
25|$|Rodezno was acutely {{sensitive}} to threat of revolution and convinced <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> could not contain it; he responded warmly to authoritarian nationalism, covering {{in his opinion}} a broad spectrum from fascist Benito Mussolini's regime to Ramsay MacDonald’s National Government. Hostile especially to militant republican secularism and agrarian reform, he remained vehement opponent in the parliament and was once hit by a flying glass in return. Touring the country he boasted that “Carlist shock troops are ready to defend society against Marxist threat”. However, he was not among those pressing an insurgent strategy. Aware of the planned Sanjurjo coup he steered clear of direct collaboration, which did not spare him expropriations administered by the government afterwards.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{studies using}} many {{different}} kinds of data, definitions, and statistical analyses have found support for the democratic peace theory. The original finding was <b>that</b> liberal <b>democracies</b> have never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> have few Militarized Interstate Disputes causing less than 1000 battle deaths with one another, that those MIDs that have occurred between democracies have caused few deaths, and <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> have few civil wars. There are various criticisms of the theory, including at least as many refutations as alleged proofs of the theory, some 200 deviant cases, failure to treat [...] "democracy" [...] as a multidimensional concept, and that correlation is not causation (Haas 2014).|$|R
40|$|The {{proposition}} <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> {{are more}} peaceful than autocracies {{has spawned a}} huge literature. Much of the relevant quantitative research has shown <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> indeed rarely, if ever, fight each other, although they are not necessarily less bellicose than autocracies in general. This essay seeks to identify several areas of concern that offer fruitful directions for further research to extend and clarify this proposition. These concerns relate to (1) conceptual clarification, (2) methodological assumptions, (3) causal interpretations, and (4) policy relevance.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effect of regime type {{on the number of}} {{civilian}} fatalities that states inflicted in interstate wars between 1900 and 2003. As opposed to several previous studies, the author finds little support for normative arguments positing <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> kill fewer civilians in war. In fact, the author finds <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> are significantly more likely than nondemocracies to kill more than fifty thousand non-combatants. Democracies also kill more civilians when they are involved in wars of attrition and kill about as many (and perhaps more) noncombatants than autocracies in such wars. These findings provide qualified support for institutional arguments about democratic accountability. Other implications of the institutional view, however, are not upheld, such as the argument <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> select easy wars that should result in few civilian casualties because they are won quickly and decisively. Finally, democracies do not appear to kill fewer civilians in more recent wars...|$|R
25|$|SDUSA members {{supported}} the independent labor-union of Poland, Solidarity. The {{organizer of the}} AFL-CIO's support for Solidarity, SDUSA's Tom Kahn, criticized Jeane Kirkpatrick's Dictatorship and Double Standards, arguing <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> be promoted even in the countries dominated by Soviet communism. In 1981 leading Social Democrats and some moderate Republicans wanted to use economic aid to Poland as leverage to expand the freedom of association in 1981, whereas Casper Weinberger and neoconservative Jeane Kirkpatrick preferred to force the Communist government of Poland to default on its international payments and so lose credibility; Kahn argued for his position in a 1981 debate with neoconservative Norman Podhoretz, who like Kirkpatrick and Weinberger opposed all credits. In 1982 Kirkpatrick called similarly for Western assistance to Poland {{to be used to}} help Solidarity.|$|E
25|$|Burke was {{a leading}} sceptic with respect to democracy. While admitting that theoretically, {{in some cases it}} might be desirable, he insisted a {{democratic}} government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive. He opposed democracy for three basic reasons. First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people. Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property. Third, Burke warned <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> would create a tyranny over unpopular minorities, who needed the protection of the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|This wave {{began at}} the end of the 1980s after the Revolutions of 1989. Its main theme was the hope that civil society, not {{enlightenment}} or revolution would pave the way for democracy in the Arab world. Civil society was seen as essential for emergence of democracy and that once a strong civil society developed, democracy was sure to follow. It was hoped <b>that</b> <b>democracy</b> would be achieved by the end of 1990s or early twenty-first century at most. The Saddam Hussein-ordered Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War have formed a strong reaction against tyranny, which was seen as the main cause of the crisis. It also weakened authoritarian regimes and gave civil society more space to maneuver. The number of non-governmental organizations in the Arab world jumped from less than 20,000 in the mid-1960s to over 70,000 in the late 1980s to 300,000 in 2008. Despite all of these developments, there was no significant democratic change in any Arab state throughout this period.|$|E
5000|$|Demagogues exploit a {{weakness}} of democracies: the greater numbers, and hence votes, {{of the lower}} classes and less-educated people—the people most prone to be whipped up into a fury and led to catastrophic action by an orator skilled at fanning that kind of flame. Democracies are instituted to ensure freedom for all and popular control over government authority; demagogues turn power deriving from popular support into a force that undermines the very freedoms and rule of law <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> are made to protect.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{builds on}} the observation <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> have more durable alliances to argue <b>that</b> <b>democracies</b> make more reliable allies. This need not be the case. Alliances serve as commitment devices, adding ex ante credibility to states' claims about ex post behavior. Variation in alliance durability must reflect differences in the desirability of formalizing alignments. Put simply, democracies are "most improved" by formal commitments. We offer two related explanations for why democracies might actually be less reliable alliance partners. Information costs for participating in policymaking and the advantages of organized interest groups combined with distributional incentives generated by the periodic turnover of governments may conspire to make informal commitments {{on the part of}} democracies problematic. Determining the net effect of democratic virtue and vice is best done empirically. We test alliance reliability by focusing on intervention, rather than on the duration or the number of commitments.
