25|$|By 1988 both artists had {{released}} {{a series of}} singles and one studio album each of their own – Mendiola with Born Again and Mateos with Spanish Dreams under the name Mayte Mathée — which saw moderate success amongst Baccara's original fan base. Mateos' Spanish Dreams was re-released on CD in Germany in the 2000s under the title Noche Latina but Mendiola's Born Again still remains unreleased in digital format. However, there remained a demand for Baccara's music, particularly on the European <b>television</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{and by the end}} of the decade both Mateos and Mendiola had formed their own versions of Baccara with new singing partners. Despite a series of name and line-up changes, both Baccara duos continue to perform around Europe and have released new albums. Both have also made re-recordings of their hits for various minor record labels, which are regularly re-packaged and re-issued under the original Baccara name, occasionally with photos of the original duo, Mateos and Mendiola, on the album covers. However, the original song versions - those recorded between 1977 and 1981 - remain the property of Sony Music Entertainment, which holds the rights to the RCA back catalogue.|$|E

During the period, he also worked on private albums and his work was noticed by {{television}} serial producers Kutty Padmini and Prabhu Nepal, who gave {{him the opportunity to}} work on the theme song and background music for their drama Krishnadasi, which began running in 2000. He subsequently began to get further work in the <b>television</b> <b>circuit,</b> garnering opportunities to score music for over 5000 episodes in shows including Kolangal, Police Diary and Mandhira Vaasal. Kutty Padmini then gave him the chance to score music and compose songs for his first feature film, Kaadhale Swasam, a romantic film featuring Karthik and Meena. However despite a grand audio launch in November 2001, the film failed to have a theatrical release. Producer Venkateswaran, was impressed with Imman's work in the album, and gave him the opportunity to compose the music for Thamizhan (2002). The album won positive reviews, with the composer also featuring the voices of the lead actors Vijay and Priyanka Chopra for a particular song. However, Imman subsequently went through another difficult period, with several of his films becoming dropped or shelved after production began and he revealed he considered a return to just being a keyboard player.|$|E
5000|$|David [...] "Dave" [...] Harold (born 9 December 1966) is an English former {{professional}} snooker {{player from}} Stoke-on-Trent. He was {{known by the}} nicknames of [...] "the Hard Man" [...] and [...] "the Stoke Potter" [...] (conflating his home city's pottery industry and his profession of potting snooker balls). He {{was also the first}} player on the <b>television</b> <b>circuit</b> to sport a plaster on his chin as a guide for his cue, which is a practice now adopted by Graeme Dott. As an amateur he played as David Harold, but since turning professional in 1991 he was registered as Dave Harold. He has three children, and is separated from his wife. He won one ranking title, reached two further finals and several semi-finals, and spent four seasons ranked among the top 16. Harold was renowned for both his very strong defensive play and his unusual cue-action, with which he is able to unleash a great deal of power on a shot without using backswing on the cue. Despite safety play ultimately being considered his strong point, he compiled 143 century breaks, putting him 22nd on the all-time list. Steve Davis has commented that he is not the most naturally gifted player, but makes up for this with strong tactical play. For his technique and grinding play he has been compared to Cliff Thorburn.|$|E

The paper explores the possibilities of design optimization for product variety under fixed product architecture.

This indicates that product variety optimization includes three classes of optimization problems, attribute assignment, module combination and simultaneous design of both.
