5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur <b>telescope</b> <b>in</b> 1820. When John Herschel {{received}} news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|A team {{of astronomers}} led by Stéphane Udry of the Geneva Observatory used the HARPS {{instrument}} on the European Southern Observatory 3.6 meter <b>telescope</b> <b>in</b> La Silla, Chile, {{to discover the}} planet in 2007.

5|$|According to SIMBAD, WASP-13 {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1997, {{when it was}} catalogued by astronomers measuring the proper motion of stars in regions of the sky where galaxies are detected.

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{construction}} in 1987, the WHT was the third largest single optical <b>telescope</b> <b>in</b> the world. It is currently the second largest in Europe, and was the final telescope constructed by Grubb Parsons in their 150-year history.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to rising}} light {{pollution}} in Cleveland, a new station in Geauga County's Montville Township {{was established in}} 1950s.

5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive optics imaging from the Keck <b>telescope</b> <b>in</b> Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>in</b> 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Spitzer devoted much of {{his career}} to pushing for the {{development}} of a space <b>telescope.</b> <b>In</b> 1962, a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.|$|E
