40|$|Refereed {{games are}} {{interactive}} proof systems with two competing provers: one {{that tries to}} convince <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> to accept and another that tries to convince <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> to reject. In quantum refereed games, <b>the</b> provers and <b>verier</b> may perform quantum computations and exchange quantum messages. One may consider games with a bounded or un-bounded number of rounds of messages between <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> and provers. In this paper, we prove classical upper bounds {{on the power of}} both one-round and many-round quantum refer-eed games. In particular, we use semidenite programming to show that many-round quantum refereed games are con-tained in NEXP. It then follows from the symmetric nature of these games that they are also contained in coNEXP. We also show that one-round quantum refereed games are con-tained in EXP by supplying a separation oracle for use with the ellipsoid method for convex feasibility. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} weaker {{variant of the}} PCP Theorem that admits a signicantly easier proof. In this variant the prover only has n t time to compute each bit of his answer, for an arbitray but xed {{constant}} t, in contrast to being all powerful. We show that 3 SAT is accepted by a polynomial-time probabilistic verier that queries a nite number of bits from a polynomially long proof string. If a boolean formula of length n is satisable, then <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> accepts with probability 1.

The main technical tools used in the proof are the " part of the PCP Theorem in which <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> reads nitely many bits from an exponentially long proof string, and the construction of a pseudo-random generator from a one-way permutation. 1 Introduction The PCP Theorem {{is one of the most}} important results in computer science.

40|$|Introduction The {{concept of}} an {{interactive}} proof protocol for deciding language membership providing zero knowledge to <b>the</b> proof <b>verier</b> was introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Racko [4]. Informally, an interactive proof protocol is zero-knowledge if interacting with the prover does not provide any additional knowledge to <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> (apart possibly from {{the validity of the}} language membership assertion being proven), regardless of the strategy used by <b>the</b> <b>verier</b> in interacting with the prover. In other words, the zero-knowledge property of an interactive proof system is a property of the prover 1 that is measured against all " verier strategies aimed at extracting additional knowledge from the interaction. The hard task in presenting a formal denition for zero-knowledge is quantifying what constitutes an in knowledge" resulting from an interaction. In the model of Goldwasser, Micali and Racko,...|$|R

5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In <b>the</b> <b>very</b> old and <b>the</b> <b>very</b> young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
