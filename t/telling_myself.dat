500|$|On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two {{teammates}} threw {{a perfect}} {{game against the}} Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth he let the count get to 3–1. [...] "I was just <b>telling</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Don't walk him,'" [...] Feldman said. [...] "Once it got to 3–1, I threw it right down the middle. [...] If they got a hit, they got a hit. [...] But they're not going {{to break up a}} perfect game on a walk." [...] The batter grounded out. [...] On July 31, the three pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.|$|E
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept <b>telling</b> <b>myself,</b> 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E

500|$|During the time, Howerdel {{continued}} to work on projects with various past A Perfect Circle members. In 2005, he wrote and composed the soundtrack to , collaborating with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese {{on a number of}} tracks. Howerdel {{continued to}} work on recording a solo album from 2005 through 2007; the sessions were difficult, so he eventually began collaborating with past A Perfect Circle members, including Lohner as a producer, Freese as a drummer, and Lenchantin as a co-writer for a track. The material was eventually released [...] under the name Ashes Divide on the album Keep <b>Telling</b> <b>Myself</b> It's Alright in early 2008. Meanwhile, Keenan had moved on from working with Tool, and started up a solo-project of sorts on his own, called Puscifer, of which he began releasing studio albums for in 2007. Despite both projects going, both Keenan and Howerdel released statements in 2008 that the band was not dead.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by Company magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E
500|$|A Perfect Circle is an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. A Perfect Circle has released three albums: their debut Mer de Noms in 2000, a follow up, Thirteenth Step in 2003, and {{an album of}} radically re-worked cover songs titled Emotive in 2004. Shortly after Emotives release, the band went into hiatus; Keenan returned to Tool and started up solo work under the band name Puscifer; and Howerdel released a solo album, Keep <b>Telling</b> <b>Myself</b> It's Alright, under the moniker Ashes Divide. Band activity was sporadic in the coming years; the band reformed in 2010, and played live shows on and off between 2010 and 2013, but fell into inactivity {{after the release of}} their greatest hits album, Three Sixty, and a live album box set, [...] in late 2013. However, in 2017, the band returned to touring and announced plans to record and release a fourth studio album under a new record label, BMG Rights Management, some time in 2018. A single from the album, [...] "The Doomed", was released in advance in October 2017.|$|E

As Moore himself recounted in the book, Star Trek: The Next Generation 365, by the fall of 1986, he was [...] "less than a year into my career as a college dropout ... working as a medical records technician (otherwise known as a receptionist) at an animal hospital, all the while <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> that I was actually a professional writer simply awaiting my inevitable discovery." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Star Wars trilogy {{is considered}} one of the best film trilogies in history. Lucas has often stated that the entire trilogy was intended to be considered one film. However, he said that his story material for Star Wars was too long for a single film, prompting Lucas to split the story into multiple films. Lucas also stated that the story evolved over time and that [...] "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> I would make other movies someday." [...] In early interviews, it was suggested the series might comprise nine or twelve films.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reaction}} to these hardships, Waits recorded Small Change (1976) which finds {{him in a}} much more cynical and pessimistic mood, with songs such as [...] "The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me) (An Evening with Pete King)" [...] and [...] "Bad Liver and a Broken Heart (In Lowell)". With the album, Waits asserted that he [...] "tried to resolve a few things as far as this cocktail lounge, maudlin, crying-in-your-beer image that I have. There ain't nothin' funny about a drunk ... I was really starting to believe that there was something amusing and wonderfully American about being a drunk. I ended up <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> to cut that shit out." [...] The album also included [...] "Tom Traubert's Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)"; it featured jazz drummer Shelly Manne and was heavily influenced by jazz, like his previous albums.|$|E

2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{was met with}} a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: [...] " [...] about many things {{that he does not}} comprehend. He was crafting with his clumsy hands manuals, grammars, anthologies, dictionaries for speculative profit. I however had an explanation for such defects. We all know that Mr. Șăineanu is not a Romanian, and we know that which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I had been <b>telling</b> <b>myself,</b> are in his blood; he could never get rid of them. I wish to talk about the passion for high praise and multiple earnings, without much investment". In 1907, Iorga and his Neamul Românesc journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for Șăineanu, calling Caragiale one who [...] "deals with the Jews", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what I have to <b>tell</b> <b>myself</b> {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really is frightening to step out and do something different. So I will <b>tell</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up".

6000|$|...

6000|$|On {{the evening}} before, as I {{was sitting in}} my library at home mournfully {{thinking}} of the occasion, <b>telling</b> <b>myself</b> that after all I could not devote my friend to what some might think a premature death, the door was opened, and Eva Crasweller was announced. She had {{on one of those}} round, close-fitting men's hats which ladies now wear, but under it was a veil which quite hid her face.
