The developed compressor equips one rotary and one scroll compression chambers as {{first and second}} stage respectively. For efficiency improvement, authors measured the cylinder pressure in each stage and conducted loss classification in the compressor. By adopting appropriate compression type in each stage, and by decreasing critical loss found by measuring the pressure, it resulted in 6 % and 10 % improvement of heating capacity and COP respectively on rated condition, and 25 % and over 50 % improvement on deep-frozen condition compared with conventional single stage compressor.

40|$|Lecturepg. 121 - 128 As subsea {{compression}} {{becomes a}} vital {{technology to the}} successful production of gas reserves in the North Sea, several technology issues {{will come to the}} forefront of the oil and gas industry. One of these important subjects is the capability to compress gas which includes a significant amount of liquids. Compressing wet gas requires knowledge in areas such as the prediction of turbomachinery performance with the mixed phase flow as well as the mechanical reliability of machinery in the same environment. This paper presents experimental results from a wet gas test campaign which, among other goals, is focused on characterizing the mechanical performance of a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor</b> operating under wet gas conditions. Various mechanical parameters are monitored in the test program including rotor radial and axial vibration, rotor thrust, and shaft torque. A full array of wet gas conditions are tested with a suction pressure of 20 bar (300 psia) and liquid volume fractions in the range of 0. 5 to 5 %. The operating fluids are air and water, and the <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor</b> is operated at three speed lines ranging from high flow to low flow conditions. Significant variations are noted in the axial thrust, axial vibration and shaft torque. Thrust variations range from seemingly neutral thrust conditions at very low water injection rates to significant thrust increases (as compared to dry condition) for very high water injection rates. Rotor axial vibration is characterized by large amplitude and very low frequency, especially for the case in which the rotor thrust is balanced by the water injection. During higher levels of water injection, rotor axial vibration is generally characterized by relatively large amplitude and slightly higher frequency, although still very low as a percent of running speed. Variations in radial vibration are also noted, but to a much lesser extent...|$|E
40|$|Low {{specific}} speed compressors have been historically based on positive displacement machines. Attempts to bring advantages of turbomachinery {{such as oil}} free, low parts counts, low cost of manufacture, and reliability to low flow rate applications have not been sparse, but the principle difficulty {{has always been that}} the conventional turbomachine design operates at ultra-high speed to deliver low volume flow rates. This is synonymous with low efficiency due to higher losses (windage, surface finish, and tip clearances). The innovative TurboClaw® design is a low {{specific speed}} turbomachinery with forward swept impeller geometry. It owes its high efficiency and operational stability to careful design of its nearly tangential forward swept blading and diffuser geometry. The present contribution describes the design and development of a high speed test rig to accurately measure TurboClaw efficiency using shaft torque. The test rig employs a permanent magnet high speed motor designed and developed for this purpose. The motor shaft drives a single stage TurboClaw® compressor via a high speed torque sensor. The results are presented and compared to data obtained through an energy balance method well established for this geometry since its first innovative development at Imperial College in 2003. The accurate performance measurements have been used to design and test a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> <b>compressor</b> to recover energy from waste steam. This is also briefly described...|$|E

25|$|An {{additional}} variant, the J402-CA-702, {{was developed}} internally by the company. This variant added an additional axial <b>compressor</b> <b>stage</b> (bringing the total to <b>two</b> axial <b>stages),</b> which increased the engine length by only 4 in (10cm), yet increased the thrust to 970lbf (4.3kN).

40|$|Flows in the ﬁrst <b>stages</b> of axial <b>compressors</b> {{are subject}} {{to a number of}} {{unsteady}} effects which are not generally taken into account in standard investigations, e. g. transition under the inﬂuence of impinging wakes {{as well as that of}} downstream potential effects, or the inﬂuence of unsteady blade row interactions. For numerical studies of these phenomena, usually, simpliﬁcations are made to the test case in question. These simpliﬁcations include domain scaling, quasi-unsteady modeling, or modeling assumptions regarding boundary layer development, like wall functions; and their impact on the ﬁnal result can be quite high. This paper is concerned with the investigation of unsteady blade row interactions in a 4. 5 <b>stage</b> research <b>compressor</b> without any of these simpliﬁcations. To this end, the whole annulus of the ﬁrst <b>two</b> <b>stages</b> of the <b>compressor</b> was meshed and unsteady RANS simulations were carried out at two different operating points. Spatial and temporal resolutions were ﬁne enough to allow the investigation of transitional phenomena on the blade surface using an integral multi-mode transition model. For each operating point, one revolution was recorded after computations reached a periodic state. Examination of the boundary layer parameters shows that transition plays a considerable role for the ﬁrst <b>two</b> <b>compressor</b> <b>stages</b> which were investigated in more detail. It was evident that the development of the blade boundary layer depends not only on incoming wakes from upstream blade rows; the precise transition location is also highly dependent on the potential effect of downstream blade rows...|$|R

The dislodgement of the whole blade without any breakage is not possible unless the locking mechanism fails.

We have designed and constructed a R&D coil made of the same superconductor as that used for the helical coils and a sub-cooled helium test facility on the assumption of the application for actual large helical device (LHD). This facility is composed of decompression tank for the sub-cooled helium generation, the R&D coil, a current lead storage tank, etc., installed in a cryostat with a liquid nitrogen shield. <b>Two</b> <b>stage</b> cryogenic <b>compressors</b> are installed in the top flange, and sub-cooled helium is generated by decompressing of saturated liquid helium from 0. 12 MPa to 24 kPa.

The PGT 2 is a 2 MW single-shaft gas turbine with a <b>two</b> <b>stage</b> centrifugal <b>compressor</b> and single can combustor. These features of the compressor and the combustion chamber are very important, because they reduce to a minimum the modifications necessary to add all the components required for operation in HAT cycle mode.

A detailed economic study is presented of the regenerated and the HAT cycles. The intercooledregenerated cycle was not considered in the economic analysis, because it does not reach the performance of the HAT cycle but it has not the advantage of being a dry cycle. All the components being added to the PGT 2 are sized to determine with a sufficient accuracy their cost. The economic analysis presents a detailed cost analysis of the optimal configurations for maximum efficiency, and allows the calculation of the capital cost of the modified gas turbine.
