40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new stage-of-fabrication inventory model with delivery, usage, and stocking of input materials that distinguishes between <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> and value added. It extends the traditional linear-quadratic model of output (nished goods) inventories by adding joint determination of input inventories, which largely have been ignored. Empirically, input inventories {{are more important}} than output inventories, especially in business cycle uctuations. Maximum likelihood estimation of the decision rules yields relatively strong support for the model using data for nondurable and durable goods industries. The value added specication outperforms <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> because adjustment costs on the change in materials usage are critical to tting the data.

40|$|The {{comment by}} Nicholson (2011 a) {{questions}} the "consistency" of the "definition" of the "biological end-member" used by Kaiser (2011 a) in {{the calculation of}} oxygen <b>gross</b> <b>production.</b> "Biological end-member" refers to the relative oxygen isotope ratio difference between photosynthetic oxygen and Air-O 2 (abbreviated 17 &delta;P and 18 &delta;P for 17 O/ 16 O and 18 O/ 16 O, respectively). This comment has no merit for the following reasons: (a) the isotopic composition of photosynthetic oxygen cannot be "defined", {{it can only be}} measured, modelled or calculated based on other data; (b) the isotopic composition of photosynthetic oxygen was not "defined" in Kaiser (2011 a), but derived from published measurements; (c) the published measurements themselves were inconsistent and no single result could be identified as best; (d) since no best value could be identified, a hypothetical base case was constructed {{in a way that was}} consistent with previous publications; (e) the values of 17 &delta;P=&minus; 11. 646 &permil; and 18 &delta;P=&minus; 22. 835 &permil; assumed for the base case are compatible with the experimental evidence published before the paper of Kaiser (2011 a); (f) even if the "biological end-member" was based on a definition, there could be no argument about the "consistency" of this definition – as per its nature, a definition is arbitrary. The qualification of base case <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> values as being " 30 % too high" must therefore also be rejected. Even though recently revised measurements of the relative 17 O/ 16 O isotope ratio difference between VSMOW and Air-O 2 , 17 &delta;VSMOW (Barkan and Luz, 2011), do support lower estimates of <b>gross</b> <b>production,</b> our own measurements disagree with these revised 17 &delta;VSMOW values. If scaled for differences in 18 &delta;VSMOW, they are actually in good agreement with the original data (Barkan and Luz, 2005). Moreover, species-dependent differences in photosynthetic isotope fractionation (Eisenstadt et al., 2010) correspond to an uncertainty of at least 15 % around the central estimate for the inferred <b>gross</b> <b>production.</b> Nicholson (2011 a) also suggests that approximated calculations of <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> should be performed with a triple isotope excess defined as 17 &Delta;#&equiv;ln(1 + 17 &delta;) &minus;&lambda;ln(1 + 18 &delta;), with &lambda;=&theta;R=ln(1 + 17 &epsilon;R) /ln(1 + 18 &epsilon;R). However, this only improves the approximation for certain 17 &delta;P and 18 &delta;P values, for certain net to <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> ratios (f) and for certain ratios of <b>gross</b> <b>production</b> to <b>gross</b> Air-O 2 invasion (g). In other cases, the approximated calculation based on 17 &Delta;&dagger;&equiv; 17 &delta;&minus;&kappa; 18 &delta; with &kappa;=&gamma;R= 17 &epsilon;R/ 18 &epsilon;R gives better results...|$|R
