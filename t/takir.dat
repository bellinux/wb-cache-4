When 1-1.5 m left to the end of form, woven fabric is cut, as the purl yarn woven fabric with an increasing of woven linen is tightened and can break.

40|$|Solid waste debris on beaches {{had caused}} environmental, aesthetical, {{economic}} and social problems in Malaysian beaches. This study discussed solid waste debris management on selected Malaysian beaches namely, Teluk Kemang, Pasir Panjang, Batu Burok, Seberang <b>Takir,</b> Tanjung Aru and Teluk Likas. The objectives of the study are to determine the abundance, composition, rate of accumulation, and the sources of debris on these beaches. It also aims to investigate the current beach management in Malaysia and beach users’ opinion and attitude towards marine pollution issues. Debris from a total area of 60 m along each beach were collected, separated, counted, and weighed. As for the users’ opinion, a total number of 180 beach users were interviewed. Results indicated that the highest abundance of debris was found in Seberang <b>Takir</b> beach at a density of 15. 5 g/ m 2 with approximately 138 items every 10 m 2 areas. Plastic was the most abundant type of debris found regardless of {{the function of the}} beach. Recreational, fishing and shipping activities are among the sources of debris on studied beaches.

Anthropogenic activities namely recreational and fishing activities are believed {{to contribute to the}} abundance of plastic debris (1 – 30 mm in size) especially along the beach. This study was undertaken to quantify and assess the degree of plastic debris buried in sand according to size with a view to classify such debris deposition at some Malaysian beaches. Another objective, the abundance distribution of the buried plastics was also studied in relation to the tidal zones of the beaches. Six selected beaches (in three different states of Malaysia) served as the representative of the fishing and recreational beaches in this study namely; Teluk Kemang Beach, Pasir Panjang Beach, Batu Burok Beach, Seberang <b>Takir</b> Beach, Tanjung Aru Beach and Teluk Likas Beach. Plastic debris were sampled once a month for three consecutive months. At each beach, triplicates of 12. 5 L of sand samples were collected from different tidal zones. The sand samples were sieved to collect and group small plastic debris according to types and sizes. A total of 2, 542 pieces of plastics were collected from all selected beaches with a density of 265. 30 g/m 2. Small-plastic debris occurred on all of the beaches, but the greatest abundance was in Seberang <b>Takir</b> Beach (879 items/m 2), followed by Batu Burok Beach (780 items/m 2), Teluk Likas Beach (249 items/m 2), Teluk Kemang Beach (231 items/m 2) and Pasir Panjang Beach (211 items/m 2).

30|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{transmission}} mid-IR spectra of CI and CI-like chondrites. In recent years, thermal emission mid-IR spectra {{have been obtained}} {{for a number of}} low-albedo asteroids (Lim et al. 2005; Emery et al. 2006; Licandro et al. 2012), including Ryugu (Hasegawa et al. 2008; Campins et al. 2009) and Bennu (Emery et al. 2014). A direct comparison of our data and asteroids is not straightforward, in part because scattering of light can change the shape and position of absorption features between transmission and reflectance spectra (<b>Takir</b> et al. 2013). Mid-IR spectra of Ryugu have been interpreted as having a weak feature in the 11.4 – 12.5 -μm region (McAdam et al. 2015). The low resolution of the asteroid spectra hampers any detailed mineralogical interpretation, but the position is comparable to the absorption bands seen from olivine, and possibly phyllosilicates, in the CI and CI-like chondrites (Fig.  3).|$|E
