5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. <b>Though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns.

The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November 1944, Shinano was {{formally}} commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent {{the previous two}} weeks fitting out and performing sea trials. Worried about her safety after a U.S. reconnaissance bomber fly-over, the Navy General Staff ordered Shinano to depart for Kure by no later than 28 November, where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place. Abe asked for a delay in the sailing date as the majority of her watertight doors {{had yet to be}} installed, the compartment air tests had not been conducted, and many holes in the compartment bulkheads for electrical cables, ventilation ducts and pipes had not been sealed. Importantly, fire mains and bailing systems lacked pumps and were inoperable; even <b>though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew had sea-going experience, they lacked training in the portable pumps on board. The escorting destroyers, Isokaze, Yukikaze and Hamakaze, had just returned from the Battle of Leyte Gulf and required more than three days to conduct repairs and to allow their crews to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jews {{still alive}} in Linz {{after the war}} had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived {{a few blocks away}} from him. Eichmann had been in charge of the {{transportation}} and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Under council ownership, {{the house}} was {{occupied}} by a caretaker, <b>though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building was open to the public. The house and grounds were used for various functions, such as the proclamation of George VI succeeding his brother King Edward VIII to the throne. At that time, {{the house was}} sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture. One of the Council's earliest projects was {{the restoration of the}} Chapel, which had fallen out of use {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall, and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed. In 1947, an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up, primarily to find furnishings for the house, but also to advertise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds. Over the years, many furnishings which had once belonged to the house were returned, including portraits of the occupants. The estate is now the property of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council (SMBC), which acquired it in 1974, following local government reorganisation.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after Omar's {{landfall}} in Guam, former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada {{declared a}} state of emergency, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area. In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for families or businesses, helping over 11,000people. The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings, although it usually only provide 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27members of the Guam National Guard and 700members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75million, <b>though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disaster needs were handled by the government. The local Red Cross provided $6million in assistance after the storm. Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September30.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. <b>Though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The reforms became firmly {{rooted in}} Bosnia during the 1860s, when the Ottoman {{governor}} (vali) {{of the province}} was Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, <b>though</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes proceeded at a slow pace. According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law, each vilayet (first-order administrative division) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette. The Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia, published in 1865, promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet, and Article9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital. Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house. At that time, the press in the Principality of Serbia and in South Slavic parts of the Austrian Empire sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in Bosnia. Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in Bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment, which Osman Pasha saw as anti-Ottoman. In his view, the national movement of the Serbs in Bosnia presented a danger for Ottoman state interests. To protect their hold on Bosnia, the Ottomans sought to promote {{the idea of a}} unitary Bosnian nation, thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia's Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.|$|E
