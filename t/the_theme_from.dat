Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored.|$|E
5|$|Princess Ida (1884) spoofed women's {{education}} and male chauvinism and continued <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> Iolanthe {{of the war}} between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce {{based on the same}} material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused {{a good deal of the}} dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1989 {{the actor}} Jack Douglas and Richard Hope-Hawkins {{organised}} a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering {{he was living}} in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120artists with Phil Collins topping the bill and Michael Caine as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and Parkinson's UK. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in Godalming, Surrey. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78.

5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love of a poor girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>from</b> parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E
