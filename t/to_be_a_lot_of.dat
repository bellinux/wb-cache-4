For that reason Ajaan Maha Bua decided to vividly describe how each noble attainment is reached, even though doing so indirectly revealed that he was confident he had attained a noble level. Though the Vinaya prohibits a monk from directly revealing ones own or another's attainments to laypeople while that person is still alive, Ajaan Maha Bua wrote in Ajaan Mun's posthumous biography that {{he was convinced that}} Ajaan Mun was an arahant. Thanissaro Bhikkhu remarks that this was a significant change of the teaching etiquette within the Forest Tradition.|$|E

It's kind of, more surreal but I think there’s going to be parts of it that might offend people – which is good. I think it's a good time to offend people. I think there's just going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> imagery that we couldn't pull off in the musical in the stage version.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} airing of [...] "The Door", HBO {{released}} a featurette titled [...] "Anatomy of a Scene" [...] which went into greater {{detail about the}} creation of the final scene at the weirwood cave.

My goal was to make it realistic, make it terrifying, and make Hodor's sacrifice incredibly moving." [...] Most of the exterior shots with the White Walkers and their army took place at Magheramorne, a small hamlet in County Antrim, Northern Ireland near where Castle Black is also filmed. With input from David Benioff and D. B.

500|$|Whether an {{advanced}} extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message {{is a matter}} of debate in itself. Sagan argued that a highly advanced extraterrestrial civilization would bear in mind that they were communicating with a relatively primitive one and therefore would try to ensure that the receiving civilization would be able to understand the message. Arguing against this view, astronomer Guillermo Lemarchand stated that {{an advanced}} civilization would probably encrypt a message with high information content, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, {{in order to ensure that}} only other ethically advanced civilizations would be able to understand it. Douglas Vakoch assumes it may take some time to decode any message, telling ABC News that [...] "I don't think we're going to understand immediately what they have to say."
