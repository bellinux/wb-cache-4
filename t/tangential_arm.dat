40|$|This paper covers {{improvements}} of {{heat pipe}} radiators for the thermionic NEP design. Liquid metal heat pipes are suitable as spacecraft radiator elements {{because of high}} thermal conductance, low mass and reliability, but the NEP thermionic system design was too large and difficult to fabricate. The current integral collector-radiator design consisting of several layers of thermionic converters, the annular-tangential collector heat pipe, the radiator heat pipe, and the transition zone designed to minimize the temperature difference between the collector heat pipe and radiator heat pipe are described. Finally, the design of micrometeoroid armor protection and the fabrication of the stainless steel annular heat pipe with a <b>tangential</b> <b>arm</b> are discussed, and it is concluded that the heat rejection system for the thermionic NEP system is well advanced, but the collector-radiator heat pipe transition and the 8 to 10 m radiator heat pipe with two bends require evaluation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} learn about in situ {{structural}} changes in materials at subseconds time scale, we have further refined the techniques of quick extended x-ray absorption fine structure (QEXAFS) and quick x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopies at beamline X 18 B at the National Synchrotron Light Source. The channel cut Si (111) monochromator oscillation is driven through a <b>tangential</b> <b>arm</b> at 5 Hz, using a cam, dc motor, pulley, and belt system. The rubber belt between the motor and the cam damps the mechanical noise. EXAFS scan taken in 100 ms is comparable to standard data. The angle and the angular range of the monochromator can be changed to collect a full EXAFS or XANES spectrum in the energy range 4. 7 - 40. 0 KeV. The data are recorded in ascending and descending order of energy, on the fly, without any loss of beam time. The QEXAFS mechanical system is outside the vacuum system, and therefore changing the mode of operation from conventional to QEXAFS takes only a few minutes. This instrument allows the acquisition of time resolved data {{in a variety of}} systems relevant to electrochemical, photochemical, catalytic, materials, and environmental sciences...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we design, fabricate, and {{validate}} a large-stroke 3 -degree-of-freedom (DOF) positioning {{stage with}} integrated displacement sensors for feedback control in a single-mask microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication process. Three equal shuttles exactly define {{the position of}} the stage in x, y, and Rz. The kinematic relation between the shuttle positions and the stage position is given by the geometric transfer function. By increasing the order of this geometric transfer function, the stage error can be reduced. Each shuttle consists of a flexure mechanism, a position sensor, and electrostatic comb drive actuators for actuation along a straight line. The range of motion of the stage is limited by electrostatic pull-in of these comb drives. Three parameters of the stage, the leafspring length, the eccentricity, and the <b>tangential</b> <b>arm,</b> have been varied to find their influence on the stage range of motion. These simulation results can be used to design stages with different specifications. Position control of the individual shuttles is applied to control {{the position of the}} stage. The stroke of the 3 DOF stage is verified up to 161 μm in x, 175 μm in y, and 325 mrad in Rz. This exceeds the range of motion of existing stages...|$|E
50|$|If the arm is not pivoted, {{but instead}} carries the stylus along a {{radius of the}} disc, there is no skating force and little to no {{cartridge}} angle error. Such arms are known as linear tracking or <b>tangential</b> <b>arms.</b> These are driven along a track by various means, from strings and pulleys, to worm gears or electromagnets. The cartridge's position is usually regulated by an electronic servomechanism or mechanical interface, moving the stylus properly over the groove as the record plays, or for song selection.|$|R
40|$|In four {{experiments}} involving blindfolded subjects, constant {{errors in}} the haptic judgment of extent in the horizontal plane were found to relate consistently to the time and velocity of limb movement. Radial movements, executed at a slower speed and for a longer time, are judged longer than tangential movements of equal extent. The data {{were considered in relation}} to certain physiological and kinematic properties of the actively moving limb. Taken together with additional information on judgments of movement duration, the results suggest that the illusion of extent is modulated by the perception of differential time cues. In these terms, it was noted that the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with the L figure is another instance of the interaction of apparent space and time commonly found in studies of psychological relativity. Following Reid's (1954) documentation of the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with an L figure, recent {{studies have shown that the}} effect is functionally related to the components of radial and <b>tangential</b> exploratory <b>arm</b> movements as described earlier by Davidon and Cheng (1964). Specifically, radial arm movements toward and away from the body, whether along the sagittal or coronal planes, are judged longer than equal tangential movements along the front or side of the body. The effect operates regardless of the spatial separation of the two extents to be judged (Cheng, 1968) and independently of two different types of movement involving different joints and muscle groups (Day & Wong, 1971). As radial movements are specific to the horizontal plane, no relative overestimation of haptic extent is found when the L figure is presented in the vertical (fronto-parallel) Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were completed at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, and supported by New Zealand University Grant...|$|R
