Giovanni Tonucci, said at Father Kaiser’s {{funeral in}} the Nairobi basilica, [...] "The church, through pitiless violence, has once more been {{deprived}} {{of one of her}} ministers. Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me. How much more I am convinced of that now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him as a martyr of the faith?".

Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter best and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back.

6000|$|The passage {{down the}} lake was pleasant, and our eyes rested on the {{different}} objects with melancholy interest, for we knew not that they would ever be again looked upon by any among us. It is an exquisite lake, and it grows on us in beauty each time <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, the surest sign of perfection. We reached Geneva early, and took lodgings at l'Ecu, in season for the ladies to make some purchases. The jewellery of this town is usually too tempting to be resisted by female self-denial, and when we met at dinner, we had a course of ear-rings, chains and bracelets served up, by a succession of shopmen, who understand, as it were by instinct, the caprices of the daughters of Eve. One of the party had taken a fancy {{to a pair of}} unfinished bracelets, and had expressed her regrets that she could not carry them with her. [...] "Madame goes to Paris?" [...] "Yes." [...] "If she will leave her address, they shall be sent to her in a month." [...] As we were strangers in France, and the regulation which prevented travellers from buying articles of this sort for their personal use, however necessary, has always appeared to me inhospitable, I told the man that if delivered in Paris, they should be received, and paid for. The bargain was made, and the jewels have already reached us. Of course I have asked no questions, and am ignorant whether they came by a balloon, in the luggage of an ambassador, or by the means of a dog.|$|E
6000|$|... 5. But, if {{we seek to}} {{know more}} than this and to {{ascertain}} {{the manner in which}} the story first crystallized into its shape, we shall find ourselves led back generally to one or other of two sources--either to actual historical events, represented by the fancy under figures personifying them; or else to natural phenomena similarly endowed with life by the imaginative power usually more or less under the influence of terror. The historical myths we must leave the masters of history to follow; they, and the events they record, being yet involved in great, though attractive and penetrable, mystery. But the stars, and hills, and storms are with us now, as they were with others of old; and it only needs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them with the earnestness of those childish eyes to understand the first words spoken of them by the children of men, and then, in all the most beautiful and enduring myths, we shall find, not only a literal story of a real person, not only a parallel imagery of moral principle, but an underlying worship of natural phenomena, out of which both have sprung, and in which both forever remain rooted. Thus, from the real sun, rising and setting,--from the real atmosphere, calm in its dominion of unfading blue, and fierce in its descent of tempest,--the Greek forms first the idea of two entirely personal and corporal gods, whose limbs are clothes in divine flesh, and whose brows are crowned with divine beauty; yet so real that the quiver rattles at their shoulder, and the chariot bends beneath their weight. And, on the other hand, collaterally with these corporeal images, and never for one instant separated from them, he conceives also two omnipresent spiritual influences, as the sun, with a constant fire, whatever in humanity is skilful and wise; and the other, like the living air, breathes the calm of heavenly fortitude, and strength of righteous anger, into every human breast that is pure and brave.|$|E

Hamilton stated that, [...] "We were trying to work out how we could bring a beach scene to life and so one of the references <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> was <b>that</b> Scissor Sisters' performance.

Robert Seidenberg, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY, wrote that Chesler defined manhood [...] "with a brilliance and erudition equal to the task", describing Chesler as men's [...] "Tocqueville".

The historian Ronald Hutton comes to much the same conclusion, that these sites were mainly used as religious centres, and each would have been a [...] "focus for a group of scattered farms or a settlement, bonded as a clan or family" [...] - very much a precursor {{to the idea of a}} [...] "parish".|$|E

Dozens of Brown Deer taxpayers worried the board was going to rush through a teachers' contract before the law became effective. When asked if the teachers' union was trying to rush a deal to beat the deadline, Lisa Albers with the Brown Deer Education Association said: [...] "I think rushing sounds a little bit harsh.

50|$|As {{opposed to}} making the easy claims that rap music is sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, Marc Anthony Neal {{suggests}} we look for possibilities in the genre, moments that rupture the hegemonic script of what most folks who do not listen to hip hop imagine it to be. He asks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the gestures by individual rappers that work {{in the service of}} queering hip hop by providing a fluid or dynamic representation that belies a static and monolithic rendering of the music. Neal looks to Jay-Z, a fixture on the hip hop landscape, and assesses the gestures he makes that trouble traditional black masculinity in hip hop representation, particularly as the rapper has tried to negotiate his presence in a genre so tied to youth while he continues to age. For Neal, queer means a departure from rap masculinity as it is normally rendered. He cites Jay-Z's dress, video treatments, and global presence as markers of his queering hip hop masculine performance. However, he notes that Jay-Z's somewhat alternative performance still maintains hegemony as exerted through classed and raced representations of masculinity.|$|E
