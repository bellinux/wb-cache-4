5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{practice}} of writing and giving kvitelach began. This practice is not mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early kabbalists, nor {{in the works of}} the school of Isaac Luria (1534–1572), the father of modern Kabbalah. The first time it is mentioned is {{during the time of the}} Baal Shem Tov (1698–1762), founder of Hasidism.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida {{were reported as}} having been based on her adorations of the Blessed Sacrament.

5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. <b>The</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and {{the writings of}} Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, {{and those of the}} Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 13th century, {{women of}} the court were {{expected}} to be able to sing, play instruments, and write jocs partis, or partimen (a debate or dialogue {{in the form of a}} poem).

5|$|Aldona (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name {{is known}} only from <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski) married Casimir III of Poland, son of Władysław I of Poland, {{when he was}} 15 or 16 years old. The {{marriage}} took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights (an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, {{but there is no}} evidence of military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.|$|E

5|$|Under the Umayyads Gaza {{served as}} a minor {{administrative}} center. In 672 an earthquake struck the city but there are few details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, Christians and Jews were taxed, though their worship and trade continued, as noted in <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishop Saint Willibald, who visited the city in 723. The year 750 saw the end of Umayyad rule in Palestine {{and the arrival of}} the Abbasids, with Gaza becoming a center for the writing of Islamic law. In 767, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al-Shafi'i founded one of the prominent fiqhs (schools of law) of Sunni Islam, named Shafi'i after him.|$|E
5|$|Born Else Ochsner in Esbjerg, Denmark, Christensen {{developed}} her anarcho-syndicalist sympathies {{while living}} in Copenhagen. From this position she moved toward the Strasserite National Bolshevik faction of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark, which brought together a far right emphasis on race with a left-wing approach to economics. In 1937 she married fellow Danish Nazi activist Aage Alex Christensen, however because of their National Bolshevik allegiances they were placed under heavy scrutiny amidst the German occupation of Denmark during World War II. After the war they moved to England and then Canada, settling in Toronto in 1951. Corresponding with various far right activists, she came upon <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American far right ideologue Francis Parker Yockey and the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills, both of whom had a profound influence on her.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2015, Lenoble {{reviewed}} overlooked historical Spanish and French sources, finding {{references to}} mainly red macaws {{consistent with the}} Lesser Antillean macaw. <b>The</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French missionary Raymond Breton (on Guadeloupe from 1635 to 1654) were especially illuminating, as they showed that both he and the native Island Caribs clearly distinguished between the red macaws of Guadeloupe and the scarlet macaws from the mainland, which supports {{the idea that the}} Lesser Antillean macaw represents an independent species. As the Lesser Antillean Carib language had different words reserved for men and women, Breton gave the name of the bird as Kínoulou (♂) and Caarou (♀). Lenoble furthermore concluded that the supposed violet macaw (named Anodorhynchus purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from Guadeloupe) was based on misidentified references to the also-extinct Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea), and therefore never existed.|$|E

5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E
5|$|This {{change is}} {{apparent}} in <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hoysala court poets, some of who are noted for pioneering works in native metres. The Veerashiava poet Harihara, {{one of the most}} prominent poets of the medieval era, established the ragale tradition with his biography of Basavanna (Basavaraja Devara ragale, 1160), the earliest available biography of the social reformer and of the Kannada language as well. His nephew Raghavanka established the shatpadi metre in his unique and original narration of the story of King Harishchandra called Harishchandra Kavya (1200). Sisumayana is credited with introducing a new composition called sangatya (1232) in his allegorical poems Tripuradahana ("Burning of the triple fortress") and Anjanacharita. Some Jain authors continued the champu tradition, such as Janna, immortalised by his writing Yashodhara Charite (1207), a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with sadomasochism and transmigration of the soul. The earliest well-known Brahmin writers also emerged during the late 12th century and wrote on themes ranging from Vaishnava faith (Rudrabhatta's Jagannatha Vijaya, 1185) to secular treatises on poetics (Kavi Kama's Sringara Ratnakara, on poetic sentiment and flavor).|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century, many {{critics of the}} {{examination}} system and government-run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies. During {{the course of the}} Southern Song, the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system. Even those that were semi-private or state-sponsored were still seen as independent of the state's influence and their teachers uninterested in larger, nationwide issues. One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the Yuelu Academy, founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976). The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, established during the Tang dynasty. The Neo-Confucian Donglin Academy, established in 1111, was founded upon the staunch teaching that adulterant influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school. This belief hearkened back to <b>the</b> <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tang essayist, prose stylist, and poet Han Yu (768–824), who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values. Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang (937–976) had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song, the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) reinvigorated it.|$|E
