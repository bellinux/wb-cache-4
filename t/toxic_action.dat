25|$|The {{majority}} of issues with tissue residue {{arise in the}} interpretation of tissue residue data. Interpretation complication can be caused by choice of endpoints, species choice, life stage sensitivity, data quality, and toxicity data extrapolation. Choice of tissue for tissue residue analysis can also be difficult and has an effect on tissue residue data. When choosing tissue, a scientist needs to consider: mode and mechanism of action of chemical being tested, site of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> for the chemical and species combination being studied and strength of the tissue residue-response relationship. There is also a lack of reliable tissue residue relationships available for comparison.|$|E

2500|$|Toxicants {{have been}} grouped {{together}} {{according to their}} chemical properties by way of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), which allows prediction of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> based on these properties. [...] endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and carcinogens are examples of classes of toxicants that can act as QSARs. EDCs mimic or block transcriptional activation normally caused by natural steroid hormones. [...] These types of chemicals can act on androgen receptors, estrogen receptors and thyroid hormone receptors. [...] This mechanism can include such toxicants as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Another class of chemicals, carcinogens, are substances that cause cancer and can be classified as genotoxic or nongenotoxic carcinogens. [...] These categories include toxicants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4).|$|E

2500|$|Alloxan is a toxic glucose analogue, which {{selectively}} destroys insulin-producing {{cells in}} the pancreas (that is beta cells) when administered to rodents and many other animal species. This causes an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (called [...] "alloxan diabetes") in these animals, with characteristics similar to type 1 diabetes in humans. Alloxan is selectively toxic to insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells because it preferentially accumulates in beta cells through uptake via the GLUT2 glucose transporter. Alloxan, {{in the presence of}} intracellular thiols, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a cyclic reaction with its reduction product, dialuric acid. The beta cell <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> of alloxan is initiated by free radicals formed in this redox reaction. Studies suggests that alloxan does not cause diabetes in humans. Others found a significant difference in alloxan plasma levels in children with and without diabetes Type 1.|$|E
2500|$|Cases {{have been}} {{reported}} of severe mercury poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities. Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury {{are similar to those}} after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury. Ethylmercury is eliminated from the brain in about 14 days in infant monkeys. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for methylmercury. Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the blood–brain barrier and the placental barrier, and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body. Concerns based on extrapolations from methylmercury caused thiomersal to be removed from U.S. childhood vaccines, starting in 1999. Since then, it has been found that ethylmercury is eliminated from the body and the brain significantly faster than methylmercury, so the late-1990s risk assessments turned out to be overly conservative. [...] Though inorganic mercury metabolized from ethylmercury has a much longer half-life in the brain, at least 120 days, it appears to be much less toxic than the inorganic mercury produced from mercury vapor, for reasons not yet understood.|$|E
60|$|Before {{proceeding}} to inquire further into this particular case, let us {{here and now}} say that, just as to-day there is no inorganic toxin known to science that will either lie fallow for weeks in the human system, suddenly to become active and slay, or yet to kill by slow degrees involving some weeks in the process, so none was known in the Borgian or any other era. Science indeed {{will tell you that}} the very notion of any such poison is flagrantly absurd, and that such a <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> is against all the laws of nature.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR). The CBR is the whole-body concentration of a chemical {{that is associated with}} a given adverse biological response and it is estimated using a partition coefficient and a bioconcentration factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first approximations of the amount of chemical present at the <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> site(s). Because different modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues, modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> in every organism, so this variability should be considered. The effects of mixture toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally additive, chemicals with more than one mode of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> may contribute to toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Modeling {{has become}} a common used tool to predict modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> in the last decade. The models are based in Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), which are {{mathematical}} models that relate the biological activity of molecules to their chemical structures and corresponding chemical and physicochemical properties. QSARs can then predict modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures. Russom and colleagues {{were one of the}} first group of researchers being able to classify modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action,</b> chemicals having multiple modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.|$|E
50|$|Non-specific acting {{modes of}} <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> result in {{narcosis}}; therefore, narcosis is {{a mode of}} <b>toxic</b> <b>action.</b> Narcosis {{is defined as a}} generalized depression in biological activity due to the presence of toxicant molecules in the organism. The target site and mechanism of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are hypotheses that support that it occurs through alterations in the cell membranes at specific sites of the membranes, such as the lipid layers or the proteins bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a narcotic toxicant can produce death, if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.|$|E

50|$|A mode of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> is {{a common}} set of {{physiological}} and behavioral signs that characterize a type of adverse biological response.

Modes of <b>toxic</b> <b>action</b> are important, widely used tools in ecotoxicology and aquatic toxicology because they classify toxicants or pollutants according to their type of <b>toxic</b> <b>action.</b> There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants.
