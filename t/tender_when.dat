25|$|On {{the other}} hand, for true believers and the righteous, death {{will cause a}} feeling of love, then it's arrives and their souls will be aparted <b>tender.</b> <b>When</b> a righteous believer dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angel of death comes, and tells the soul {{to come out to}} the {{pleasure}} and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called Munkar and Nakir. He succeeds in answering the questions, and is blessed with heavenly rewards.|$|E
500|$|The Kand K1classes were {{absorbed by}} British Railways {{as part of}} the Uand U1classes in 1948, which were given the BR power {{classification}} 4MT (mixed-traffic) in 1950. This was later revised to 4P3F in the light of operational experience on freight trains. The locomotives at first retained their Southern Railway livery, with [...] "British Railways" [...] added to the <b>tender</b> <b>when</b> repaints were due. From 1949 to 1955, the Uand U1class locomotives were gradually repainted in the British Railways mixed-traffic lined black livery with red, cream and grey lining and the British Railways crest on the tender. Numbers were changed to the British Railways standard numbering system: the series 3179031809 was allocated to the Kclass rebuilds, and 31890 to the K1class.|$|E
500|$|Like {{most other}} puffball species, L.echinatum is edible when still young {{and while the}} gleba is still white and firm. Consumption of older {{specimens}} with a non-white gleba, or where the gleba {{has turned into a}} powdery spore mass, may cause stomach upsets. This species has a mild taste, and no distinguishable odor, although one source describes the smell of dried fruit bodies as similar to [...] "old ham". One source notes that it is [...] "well flavoured and <b>tender</b> <b>when</b> cooked", while another describes the texture (of edible puffballs in general) as [...] "somewhat like French toast". Antonio Carluccio recommends sautéeing puffballs with other mushrooms. To avoid possible confusion with potentially deadly Amanita species, it is recommended to slice young puffballs with a longitudinal cut to ensure that the flesh is devoid of any internal structures.|$|E

2500|$|The raw fruit {{can have}} a {{somewhat}} bitter taste, or even an astringent quality, but becomes <b>tender</b> <b>when</b> cooked and develops a rich, complex flavor. The fruit is capable of absorbing large amounts of cooking fats and sauces, making for very rich dishes, but salting reduces the amount of oil absorbed. Many recipes advise salting, rinsing, and draining the sliced fruit (a process known as [...] "degorging") to soften it and {{to reduce the amount}} of fat absorbed during cooking, but mainly to remove the bitterness of the earlier cultivars. Some modern cultivars—including large purple ones commonly imported into western Europe—do not need this treatment.|$|E
2500|$|However, Brisbane did {{not always}} receive loyal support from his {{administrative}} officers, and in particular from Frederick Goulburn, the colonial secretary. A reference to Brisbane's dispatch to Earl Bathurst dated 14 May 1825 shows that Bigge's recommendations had been carefully considered, and that many improvements had been made. Brisbane did not limit his attention to Bigge's report. Early in April 1822 he discovered with some surprise {{the ease with which}} grants of land had hitherto been obtained. He immediately introduced a new system under which every grant had the stipulation that for every [...] granted the grantee would maintain free of expense to the crown one convict labourer. He also encouraged agriculture on government land, streamlined granting of tickets of leave and pardons and introduced, in 1823, a system of calling for supplies by <b>tender.</b> <b>When</b> Dr. Robert Wardell and William Wentworth brought out their paper the Australian in 1824, Brisbane tried the experiment of allowing full latitude of the freedom of the press.|$|E

60|$|But, as I have said, poetry, {{was what}} his ardent spirit mainly meditated in that hour when I first knew him in Cambridge, {{before we had}} either of us grown old and sad, if not wise.

He was constantly at my house, where in an absence of my family I was living bachelor, and where we sat indoors and talked, or sauntered outdoors and talked, with our heads in a cloud of fancies, not unmixed with the mosquitoes of Cambridge: if I could have back the fancies, I would be willing to have the mosquitoes with them. He looked the poetry he lived: his eyes were the blue of sunlit fjords; his brown silken hair was thick on the crown which it later abandoned to a scholarly baldness; his soft, red lips half hid a boyish pout in the youthful beard and mustache.

The long stem bleeds copiously when cut, and like almost all woody climbers, is full of large vessels; the juice does not, however, exude from these great tubes, which hold air, but from the close woody fibres.
