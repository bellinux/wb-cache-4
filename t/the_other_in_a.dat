5|$|In 2008–09, Pellissier {{played all}} of Chievo's 38 Serie A matches and scored 13 goals, {{including}} two on 15 March 2009 in a 3–0 victory over S.S. Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico. Three weeks later, on 5 April, he scored the first hat-trick {{of his career}} in a 3–3 draw against Juventus in Turin; this was followed on 19 April by a brace in a match against Siena. Pellissier's 2008–09 performance won him the Cangrande award for the third consecutive season. He played 35 matches and scored 11 goals in the 2009–10 season, with consecutive scores in the third and fourth round, in the 21st and 22nd, and in the 34th and 35th. In 2010–11, Pellissier made the same numbers of appearances and scored the same number of goals as in the previous season. He scored two braces in the seasonthe first in a 3–1 win against Napoli and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 win against Brescia.

5|$|On February 7, 2012, Metallica {{announced}} that it would start a new music festival called Orion Music + More, which took place on June 23 and 24, 2012, in Atlantic City. Metallica also confirmed that it would headline the festival on both days and would perform two of its most critically acclaimed albums in their entirety: The Black Album on one night, and Ride the Lightning on <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> July 2012 interview with Canadian radio station 99.3 The Fox, Ulrich said Metallica would not release its new album until at least early 2014. In November 2012, Metallica left Warner Bros. Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases. The band has acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which will be reissued through the new label. Blackened releases will be licensed through Warner subsidiary Rhino Entertainment in North America and internationally through Universal Music. On September 20, 2012, Metallica announced via its official website that a new DVD containing footage of shows it performed in Quebec in 2009 would be released that December; fans would get the chance to vote for two setlists that would appear on the DVD. The film, titled Quebec Magnetic, was released in the U.S. on December 10, 2012.|$|E

5|$|The second {{episode in}} Bismarck's {{unification}} efforts occurred in 1866. In {{concert with the}} newly formed Italy, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, the Prussian representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war against Austria. The next day, the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck's difficult and ambiguous relationship with the Prussian Landtag (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck's cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first start of the 2011–12 season in Stevenage's first home win of the campaign, playing the first 76 minutes in a 4–2 victory over Rochdale on 3 September 2011 Byrom scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's {{emphatic}} 6–1 away victory against Colchester United in December 2011, scoring the sixth goal after a fine individual run and finish. The following month, on 14 January 2012, Byrom doubled his goal tally for the season when he scored with a first-time finish from Luke Freeman's cross in Stevenage's 5–1 win over Rochdale at Spotland. Byrom scored in Stevenage's televised FA Cup tie away at Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in that year, scoring from the penalty spot to give Stevenage a brief lead before Tottenham came back to secure a 3–1 win. He went on to score two further goals during the latter stages of the season; once in a 2–2 draw away at Sheffield United, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 3–0 win over Bury, {{on the last day of}} the regular season as Stevenage secured a play-off place following their sixth-place finish. He played in both play-off semi-final legs, which Stevenage lost 1–0 on aggregate to Sheffield United. He made 40 appearances during the season, scoring five times. Despite appearing regularly under new manager Gary Smith, Byrom rejected the offer of a contract extension, and left Stevenage in May 2012. During his successful three-year spell with the club, he made 100 appearances in all competitions, scoring eleven goals.|$|E

25|$|Any poset (B,≤) {{such that}} every pair x,y of {{elements}} has both a sup and an inf {{is called a}} lattice. We write x∨y for the sup and x∧y for the inf.

The lattice {{is said to be}} distributive when x∧(y∨z)= (x∧y)∨(x∧z), or equivalently when x∨(y∧z)= (x∨y)∧(x∨z), since either law implies <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lattice. These are laws of Boolean algebra whence the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra forms a distributive lattice.|$|E

The level of darkness experienced creates an environment impossible to see in without an artificial form of light. Caves often contain sand, mud, clay, silt, or other sediment that can further reduce underwater visibility in seconds when stirred up.|$|E

25|$|Croatia {{acquired}} three MiG-21s in 1992 through defections by Croatian pilots {{serving with}} the JNA, {{two of which}} were lost in subsequent actions – one to Serbian air defenses, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> friendly fire accident. In 1993, Croatia purchased about 40 MiG-21s in violation of an arms embargo, but only about 20 of these entered service, while the rest were used for spare parts. Croatia used them alongside the sole remaining defector for ground attack missions in operations Flash (during which one was lost) and Storm. The only air-to-air action for Croatian MiGs was an attempt by {{two of them to}} intercept Soko J-22 Oraos of Republika Srpska Air Force on ground attack mission on August 7, 1995.

25|$|In 1940 he {{introduced}} {{a much better}} solution using a system known today as hybrid color. This used a traditional black and white CRT with a rotating colored filter in front. Three frames, sent one after <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> system known as sequential scan, were displayed on the CRT while the colored wheel was spun in synchronicity. This design was physically very long, leading to deep receiver chassis, but later versions folded the optical path using mirrors to produce a somewhat more practical system. Again, Baird {{was not the only}} one to produce such a system, with CBS displaying a very similar system at almost the same time. However, Baird was not happy with the design later stated that a fully electronic device would be better.|$|E

The engines were taken from steamer Ingomar, but two months were needed for their transfer. The casemate extended her full length, less 25 feet at each end. It was covered by T-rail iron in two courses, while its top was encompassed by sheet iron bulwarks nearly four feet high.|$|E
