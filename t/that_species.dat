5|$|Darwin theorized <b>that</b> <b>species</b> {{flourish}} or die when {{subjected to}} the processes of natural selection or selective breeding. Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{has also}} been cited as contributing to the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>species</b> are Darwinian individuals, and not just classes, thereby providing a stronger framework for a hierarchical theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The pine bunting and {{yellowhammer}} are {{so closely}} related that each {{responds to the}} other's song. The male yellowhammer's song is more attractive to females, and is {{one reason for the}} dominance of <b>that</b> <b>species</b> where the ranges overlap.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the second}} row, the 5 {{in the first}} column means <b>that</b> five <b>species,</b> species [...] "e" [...] through [...] "i", have {{abundance}} one. The following two zeros in columns 2 and 3 mean <b>that</b> zero <b>species</b> have abundance 2 or 3. The 3 in column 4 means <b>that</b> three <b>species,</b> species [...] "b", [...] "c", and [...] "d", have abundance four. The final 1 in column 10 means <b>that</b> one <b>species,</b> species [...] "a", has abundance 10.|$|R

5|$|Viruses infect all {{cellular}} life and, although viruses occur universally, each cellular {{species has}} its own specific range that often infect only <b>that</b> <b>species.</b> Some viruses, called satellites, can replicate only within cells {{that have already been}} infected by another virus.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although <b>that</b> <b>species</b> is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted <b>that</b> <b>species</b> have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
50|$|Different Heliconia {{species have}} {{different}} flowering seasons. This suggests <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> compete for pollinators. It was found <b>that</b> many <b>species</b> of Heliconia, even the newly colonized species, all had many pollinators visit.|$|R
50|$|Narope is a genus of Neotropical {{butterflies}} <b>that</b> includes <b>species</b> <b>that</b> present inconspicuously marking {{patterns on}} the wings. The genus includes 16 species.|$|R
50|$|A {{study by}} Russian ornithologists in 2011 {{indicated}} <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> had been misidentified as A. dumetorum in museum collections and <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> may be breeding in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, eastern Uzbekistan and south-eastern Kazakhstan.|$|R
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than <b>that</b> <b>species.</b> Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from cirl buntings by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the African river martin {{was the sole}} member of its genus and {{subfamily}} until {{the discovery of the}} white-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon eurystomina, by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya in 1968. Although some authorities follow Brooke in placing <b>that</b> <b>species</b> in a separate genus Eurochelidon due to its significant differences from the African species, it remains a member of the same subfamily. Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily.|$|E
5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>species</b> could acquire new characteristics from {{influences in}} their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E

40|$|Marc Ereshefsky argues <b>that</b> {{pluralism}} about <b>species</b> suggests <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> {{concept is}} not theoretically useful. It {{is to be}} abandoned in favor of several concrete <b>species</b> concepts <b>that</b> denote real categories. While accepting species pluralism, the present paper rejects eliminativism about the species category. Based on the idea <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> concept is a so-called investigative kind concept, it is argued <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> concept is important {{and that it is}} possible to make sense of a general species concept despite the existence of different concrete species concepts.

5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require <b>that</b> a <b>species</b> actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a warning signal by a mimicking <b>species</b> <b>that</b> resembles a <b>species</b> <b>that</b> possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|R
5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence of}} the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply <b>that</b> <b>species</b> continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E
5|$|Its {{external}} morphology {{is similar}} to that of Holochilus brasiliensis, and over the course of its complex taxonomic history it has been confused with <b>that</b> <b>species,</b> but other features support its placement in a distinct genus, Lundomys. Within the family Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae, it is a member of a group of specialized oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Carletonomys, and Pseudoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Many {{environmental}} {{scientists believe}} amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears <b>that</b> <b>species</b> with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.|$|E
30|$|Considering <b>that</b> some <b>species</b> may totally vanish {{because of}} the {{internal}} dynamics, all the reactions in which the vanished species have been involved are however conserved, {{in order to maintain}} the consistency of the system (in the case <b>that</b> those <b>species</b> may reappear).|$|R
50|$|Nota bene: In {{the above}} species lists, an authoritys name in {{parentheses}} indicates <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> was originally {{described in a}} different genus. An authoritys name not in parentheses indicates <b>that</b> the <b>species</b> is still assigned to the original genus {{in which it was}} described.|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} {{invasive}} species {{found in a}} region depends {{on the number of}} <b>species</b> <b>that</b> have been introduced, the proportion of introduced <b>species</b> <b>that</b> have become established, and the proportion of established <b>species</b> <b>that</b> have gone on to cause impacts. When investigating differences among regions, invasion biologists have generally left aside the pathways and process of introduction and focused instead on the proportions of introduced <b>species</b> <b>that</b> become established, and of established <b>species</b> <b>that</b> become invasive [39]. Ecosystems where these proportions are high have been assumed to be highly invasible, while others have been deemed relatively resistant.|$|R
5|$|Smilodon {{and other}} saber-toothed cats have been reconstructed with both plain-colored coats and with spotted {{patterns}} (which {{appears to be}} the ancestral condition for feliforms), both of which are considered possible. Studies of modern cat species have found <b>that</b> <b>species</b> that live in the open tend to have uniform coats while those that live in more vegetated habitats have more markings, with some exceptions. Some coat features, such as the manes of male lions or the stripes of the tiger, are too unusual to predict from fossils.|$|E
5|$|Some fireflies of {{the genus}} Photuris mimic the {{flashing}} of female Photinus species to attract males of <b>that</b> <b>species,</b> which are then captured and devoured. The colors of emitted light vary from dull blue (Orfelia fultoni, Mycetophilidae) to the familiar greens and the rare reds (Phrixothrix tiemanni, Phengodidae).|$|E
5|$|Subfossil parrot {{remains were}} later {{excavated}} from grottos on Réunion and reported in 1996. X-rays {{of the two}} existing stuffed Mascarene parrots {{made it possible to}} compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to the modern specimens. The lesser vasa parrot was introduced to Réunion as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to <b>that</b> <b>species</b> in some aspects, they were more {{similar to those of the}} Mascarene parrot and considered to belong to it.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are certain}} plant <b>species</b> <b>that</b> occur on Fremont Island, {{and there is}} {{historic}} evidence <b>that</b> some <b>species</b> <b>that</b> were earlier documented to occur on the island are no longer present. For example, explorers who visited this island in the mid-1800s noted the presence of abundant [...] "onions" [...] which they identified as Calochortus luteus. However, this name was applied to plants that were later renamed as other species. While {{it is unlikely that}} the California endemic C. luteus occurred on Fremont Island, it is clear <b>that</b> some <b>species</b> of Calochortus once present is now extinct.|$|R

5|$|The 1891 {{publication}} Revisio generum plantarum was German botanist Otto Kuntze's {{response to}} what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and <b>that</b> <b>species</b> had already been placed by Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus {{on the grounds of}} priority, and made the new combination Atylus anethifolius. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.|$|E

5|$|The genus name Triturus was {{introduced}} in 1815 by the polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, with the northern crested newt (Triturus cristatus) as type species. <b>That</b> <b>species</b> was originally described as Triton cristatus by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768, but Linnaeus had already used the name Triton for a genus of sea snails ten years before, making a new genus name for the newts necessary.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{examination}} of preserved specimens, it appears <b>that</b> this <b>species</b> had a [...] "belly button" [...] slit, indicating viviparism. However, there are also reports <b>that</b> indicate this <b>species</b> was an egg layer.|$|R
50|$|Species also {{interact}} with other <b>species</b> <b>that</b> require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate <b>that</b> when <b>species</b> compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest <b>that</b> competing <b>species</b> cannot coexist (they cannot live {{together in the same}} area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.|$|R
