5|$|Albert Speer said <b>that</b> <b>though</b> Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, {{he was a}} {{good decision}} maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS into every aspect of daily life. Historian Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system {{under the auspices of the}} SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed <b>that,</b> <b>though</b> publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E

5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out <b>that</b> <b>though</b> Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said <b>that</b> <b>though</b> Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>though</b> the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it {{probably did not}} cause any major physical deformity {{that could not be}} disguised by clothing.|$|E

In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning to remake the film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed <b>that</b> <b>though</b> he was writing the screenplay based on the film, he would take the final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E

5|$|In 1877, Skopje {{was chosen}} as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which {{encompassed}} present-day Kosovo, northwestern Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. In 1905, the city had 32,000 inhabitants, making it the largest of the vilayet, although closely followed by Prizren with its 30,000 inhabitants. Of the Skopje Muslim population of the late Ottoman period German linguist Gustav Weigand noted <b>that</b> <b>though</b> most were Albanians regarded as Turks or Ottomans (Osmanli), they spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home. At the beginning of the 20th century, local economy was focused on dyeing, weaving, tanning, ironworks and wine and flour processing.|$|E

The {{strategy}} aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community. By early 2010, it was apparent <b>that</b> <b>though</b> it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, Anne {{sometimes}} exploited court factionalism {{for her own}} ends, {{in particular}} by supporting the enemies of the Earl of Mar. As a result, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James <b>that</b> <b>though</b> Anne possessed every virtue, Eve was corrupted by the serpent. In practice, Anne was little interested in high politics unless they touched {{on the fate of}} her children or friends.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout.

5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article <b>that</b> <b>though</b> evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, {{and that it would}} be instructive to study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented <b>that</b> <b>though</b> companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they did not intend to cause offence.|$|E
5|$|Metro contended <b>that</b> <b>though</b> TumbleSeed was {{marketed as}} a roguelike, {{apart from its}} procedurally {{generated}} levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games.

Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act of losing all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh.|$|E

At launch, Aston Martin planned to build between 1,400 and 1,500 DB9s per year.|$|E
5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, <b>that,</b> <b>though</b> he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E
