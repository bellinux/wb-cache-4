At the time, around 60% of city's 15,000 inhabitants were Armenians. His family was part of the Catholic minority of Javakhk Armenians, most of whom were followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church. His ancestors came from Erzurum in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. Fleeing Ottoman persecution, they sought refuge in the Russian Caucasus.

5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.|$|E

5|$|Sigeberht was {{probably}} either a younger son of Rædwald of East Anglia, or his step-son from Rædwald's {{marriage to a}} pagan princess from the kingdom of Essex. Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done {{in order to ensure}} that Rædwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (perhaps in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of Rædwald's, or his nephew.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasid {{invasion}} of Asia Minor in 782 {{was one of}} the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire. The invasion was launched as a display of Abbasid military might in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of Byzantine successes. Commanded by the Abbasid heir-apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there. As Harun did not intend to assault Constantinople and lacked ships to do so, he turned back.|$|E

As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008, her resulting probation was seen by some commentators as too lenient.|$|E

5|$|The British Psychological Society {{issued a}} {{statement}} offering to provide expert support in psychological testing and monitoring of pilots.

It said priority should be given to psychological help for relatives and friends of victims in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disaster.|$|E
5|$|As Palmyra gained {{importance}} to French efforts to pacify the Syrian Desert, a base {{was constructed in}} the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929 the general director of antiquities in Syria, Henri Arnold Seyrig, began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers {{to move to a}} new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur. During World War II, the Mandate came under the authority of Vichy France, who gave permission to Nazi Germany to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of Free France, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo {{studied for}} the Indian Civil Service at King's College, Cambridge, England. After {{returning}} to India {{he took up}} various civil service works under the maharaja of the princely state of Baroda and began increasingly involved in nationalist politics and the nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal. He was arrested in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of bomb outrages linked to his organisation, but in a highly public trial where he faced charges of treason, Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against British rule in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following {{the murder of a}} prosecution-witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to Pondicherry, leaving politics for spiritual work.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being set}} in space, the film uses motifs from {{shipwreck}} and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> catastrophe. Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation {{in the face}} of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive {{in the face of}} overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Developed from ponies {{taken to}} Iceland by Norse {{settlers}} in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history; the first reference to a named horse appears in the 12th century. Horses were venerated in Norse mythology, a custom brought to Iceland by the country's earliest settlers. Selective breeding over the centuries has developed the breed into its current form. Natural selection has also played a role, as the harsh Icelandic climate eliminated many horses through cold and starvation. In the 1780s, much of the breed was wiped out in <b>the</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> volcanic eruption at Laki. The first breed society for the Icelandic horse was created in Iceland in 1904, and today the breed is represented by organizations in 19different nations, organized under a parent association, the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations.|$|E
