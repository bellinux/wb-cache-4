The film was created on a budget of $500,000, with Cameron as the lead actor, portraying Captain Caleb Holt. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> low-budget film, the film grossed $33,415,129 and was a box office success. It was the highest grossing independent film of 2008.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s Atheis {{had become}} part of the Indonesian junior and senior high school curriculum. In 1974 Sjumandjaja adapted the novel into a film with the same title. The film, shot on a Rp. 80 million (US$193,771) budget, mimicked the novel's {{non-linear}} plot. Intended as a challenge to Indonesia's religious communities, upon its release faced with controversy. Ultimately, the Indonesian censorship bureau passed the film after several cuts. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> commercial failure, Sjumandjaja's Atheis was well received by critics.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Led Zeppelin {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E

5|$|After this {{bout with}} the censors, Takechi vowed {{to produce a}} true, {{hardcore}} film for Japanese audiences. The result was Sacred Koya (Koya Hijiri), based on a work by Kyōka Izumi. He refused to allow the film to be censored in any way, either through cutting or fogging. Refusing to release the film in Japan, he did not submit it for Eirin's approval. Instead, he released it in Guam, where it played primarily to Japanese tourist audiences for several years under the U.S.'s more liberal pornography laws. Takechi's last film was another remake of Daydream in 1987, again starring Kyōko Aizome. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> low-budget, independent production which again underwent censorship in Japan, it became very popular in its uncensored form in France.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 23 January 1719, when Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz united and raised to the dignity of a principality. Liechtenstein {{was a part of}} the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805; this marked Liechtenstein's formal independence, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards. While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead. Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921, Hans-Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein's politics in the early 21st century, which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003, effectively making Liechtenstein a semi-constitutional monarchy again. However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely. The current monarch is Hans-Adam II, who turned over the day-to-day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein on 15 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} games, Dead Phoenix was {{canceled}} and only P.N.03 retained {{its status as}} a GameCube exclusive, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> critical and commercial failure. Both Viewtiful Joe and Killer7 sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. Even so, Killer7 gained a significant cult following, effectively launching the career of director Suda51. Resident Evil 4 was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a Sony PlayStation 2 port to be released later in 2005. Viewtiful Joe also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and Killer7 debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the Nintendo 64, Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for Resident Evil 4, as a major blow to Nintendo–Capcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.|$|E

By the mid-1280s, when Pagan was fighting a losing war against the Mongol invaders, Akhamaman had emerged as the main political and civic leader of Pegu.
