5|$|A {{fund-raising}} experiment, Dunc-Tank, {{was created}} to solve the release cycle problem and release managers were paid to work full-time; in response, unpaid developers slowed down <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> the release was delayed. Debian 4.0 (Etch) was released in April 2007, featuring the x86-64 port and a graphical installer. Debian 5.0 (Lenny) was released in February 2009, supporting Marvell's Orion platform and netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC. The release was dedicated to Thiemo Seufer, a developer {{who died in a}} car crash.|$|E

5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience {{and she did}} so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive {{of herself as a}} more serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein's {{books are}} {{an attempt to}} examine the works of {{mainstream}} scholarship. The authors whose work he has thus targeted, including Daniel Jonah Goldhagen and Dershowitz, along with others such as Benny Morris whose work Finkelstein has also cited in his scholarship, have in turn accused Finkelstein of grossly misrepresenting <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> selectively quoting from their books.|$|E
5|$|GTRI is {{composed}} of eight laboratories organized by technical focus into three research and development directorates. Each lab is further subdivided into divisions.

5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began {{to adapt to the}} changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and,</b> in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 and 1997, he and {{his wife}} Ann Shulgin {{authored}} the books PIHKAL and TIHKAL (standing for Phenethylamines and Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved), which extensively described <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> personal experiences with these two classes of psychoactive drugs. Shulgin performed seminal work into the descriptive synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of Shulgin's noteworthy discoveries include compounds of the 2C* family (such as 2C-B) and compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM).|$|E
5|$|The journal was {{a private}} venture, {{although}} no contributor or editor was ever paid for <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> the editors often had to support the publication {{out of their own}} pockets.

5|$|The {{report of}} the journey, which {{included}} sharp criticism of the governor of Saratov, was not well received at court. The Forsters claimed they had not received fair payment for <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> had to move house. They chose to settle in England in 1766. The father took up teaching at the Dissenter's Academy in Warrington and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of Lomonosov's history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.|$|E
5|$|With {{fall of the}} Austrian regime, the revolutionaries {{were forced}} to decide what form a new revolutionary state would take. Figures within revolutionary France, such as Jacques Pierre Brissot, praised <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> {{encouraged}} them to declare their own national independence {{in the spirit of}} the American Revolution. On 30 November, a Declaration of Unity was signed between Flanders and the Brabant states. On 20 December, an actual declaration of independence was signed proclaiming the end of Austrian rule and the independence of the states.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{names are}} Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, Hendrick Laurensz. Spieghel and Roemer Visscher. Inevitably, <b>their</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> career {{were very much}} determined by the struggle between Reformation and the Catholic Church.|$|R

5|$|Curie and {{her husband}} {{declined}} to go to Stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> Pierre, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. As Nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the Curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. The award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, and galvanized by an offer from the University of Geneva, which offered Pierre a position, the University of Paris gave Pierre a professorship and the chair of physics, although the Curies still {{did not have a}} proper laboratory. Upon Pierre's complaint, the University of Paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.|$|E
5|$|Further {{support for}} the {{association}} between autism and thiomersal appeared in an article by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. in the magazines Rolling Stone and Salon.com alleging a government conspiracy at a CDC meeting to conceal the dangers of thiomersal to protect the pharmaceutical industry, and a book written by David Kirby, Evidence of Harm, dramatizing the lives of parents of autistic children, with both authors participating in media interviews to promote <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> the controversy. Although the allegations by Kennedy were denied and a US Senate committee investigation later found no evidence to substantiate the most serious allegations, the story had already been well publicized by leveraging Kennedy's celebrity. Salon magazine subsequently amended Kennedy's article five times due to factual errors and later retracted it completely on January 16, 2011, stating that the works of critics of the article and evidence of the flaws in the science connecting autism and vaccines undermined {{the value of the}} article to the editors.|$|E
5|$|In early 2001, Boisselier {{promised the}} cloning {{of a human}} child within a year, drawing further {{attention}} to her work. A prosecutor in New York began investigating her compliance with local medical laws. Boisselier said that the Food and Drug Administration also surreptitiously investigated her, and Raël claimed that U.S. President George W. Bush was concerned about Clonaid's work. The caretaker of the laboratory that Hunt had rented grew suspicious about <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> contacted law enforcement. They spoke with the FDA, who searched the site and persuaded Boisselier to suspend her cloning work pending legal clarification. After Hunt {{was asked by the}} laboratory's caretaker to shut down the cloning operation, he broke with Boisselier and criticized her for seeking media attention. The caretaker also spoke publicly, saying that Boisselier was seldom at the laboratory. Boisselier then announced that she was moving her cloning operations overseas. Boisselier never faced any legal charges in connection with the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the ANC {{held to the}} belief that its primary {{activity}} was political organising, and that any cultural activity was secondary to this. This belief began to shift with the establishment of the Mayibuye Cultural Ensemble in 1975, and the Amandla Cultural Ensemble later in the 1970s. Mayibuye was established as a growing number of ANC activists argued that cultural events needed to form a part of <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> could be used to raise awareness of apartheid, gather support, and drive political change. The group was established by ANC activists Barry Feinberg and Ronnie Kasrils, who named it after the slogan Mayibuye iAfrika (Let Africa Return). The group consisted of several South African performers, and used a mixture of songs, poetry, and narrative in their performance, which described life under the apartheid government and their struggle against it. The songs were often performed in three- or four-part harmony. The group performed more than 200 times across Europe, and were seen as the cultural arm of the ANC. The group experienced personal and organisational difficulties, and disbanded in 1980.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> {{asked if they}} could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5|$|Players cast {{a fishing}} line {{into the ocean}} and use motion {{controls}} to avoid fish as the hook sinks and to catch as many fish as possible as the reel retracts. Players then touch the screen to shoot fish {{out of the sky}} for money that can be spent on upgrades. Nijman developed the idea during a television show about tuna fishermen. The game was first released as Flash game Radical Fishing with the same basic mechanics. A year after Vlambeer began their iOS development, Gamenauts released Ninja Fishing, a clone of the game that hurt Vlambeer morale. The team worked on other games and spoke publicly about the situation to a standing ovation at the 2012 Game Developers Conference before resolving to scrap the majority of <b>their</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> finish the game. Artist Greg Wohlwend moved in with iOS developer Zach Gage to work 14-hour days on the game.|$|E
50|$|The label {{has also}} had a long and {{fruitful}} association with the Finnish composers Einojuhani Rautavaara, Kaija Saariaho and Magnus Lindberg, having recorded the premieres of many of <b>their</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> garnering many awards along the way.|$|R
