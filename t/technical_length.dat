This paper {{was inspired by the}} fact that over the past years, technical plants have been reconsidered in Romania, given the international crisis of resources and energy. Dobrogea is a favorable zone for oil flax and mixed flax. In the mixed flax, the <b>technical</b> <b>length</b> is between 30 - 50 cm, being used both for oil and the extraction of fibers. The major objectives of this paper are: aspects regarding the cultivation of oil flax and mixed flax in connection to distribution, biological particularities and requirements for climate and soil, with particular reference to the actual conditions of Dobrogea, as well as the cultivation technology of this plant which can be grown in drier regions as well. Given the climatic changes at international level, but also in our country, the structure of crops must be reconsidered, especially in the areas heavily affected by drought. Oil flax loves the heat and can be considered for cultivation on large surfaces in Dobrogea, on the condition that the cultivation technology should respect the climatic requirements...|$|E

A two-year study was carried out at Ismailia Agricultural Experiments and Research Station, ARC, Ismailia governorate, Egypt during 2013 / 2014 and 2014 / 2015 seasons to decrease mineral nitrogen (N) inputs of flax with increasing profitability for Egyptian farmer under different cropping sequences and planting dates in sandy soil. This experiment included 27 treatments which were the combinations of three cropping sequences (peanut / flax, peanut /fahl berseem / flax and peanut / fodder maize / flax), three flax planting dates (5 th November, 15 th November and 25 th November) and three mineral N fertilizer rates (107. 1, 142. 8 and 178. 5 kg N/ha).

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} aimed to {{estimate}} the type of gene action of the different flax traits including <b>technical</b> plant <b>length,</b> number of capsules/plant, seed yield/plant besides oil content and fatty acid com-position of the oil from genetic study of six populations, i. e., P 1, P 2, F 1, BC 1, BC 2 and F 2 of the cross between Egyptian cultivar, Giza- 8 and the Netherlandish cultivar, Viking through 1998 / 1999 to 2002 / 2003 seasons at Alexandria, Egypt. Significant genetic variance were showed for the studied traits. Additive genetic variance contained the major component in the inheritance of seed yield and number of cap-sules/plant while both additive and dominance variance were sig-nificantly equal in <b>technical</b> plant <b>length</b> inheritance. Oil content and linolenic fatty acid were genetically controlled by additive gene effect while palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids are genetically con-trolled by dominance gene effect. Heritability estimates (broad-sense) were 91. 72, 76. 75, 71. 33 and 87. 97 % for seed yield/plant, number of capsules/plant, <b>technical</b> plant <b>length</b> and oil content, respectively.

40|$|Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an {{important}} cash crop, and its agronomic traits directly affect yield and quality. Molecular studies on flax remain inadequate because relatively few flax genes {{have been associated with}} agronomic traits or have been identified as having potential applications. To identify markers and candidate genes that can potentially be used for genetic improvement of crucial agronomic traits, we examined 224 specimens of core flax germplasm; specifically, phenotypic data for key traits, including plant height, <b>technical</b> <b>length,</b> number of branches, number of fruits, and 1000 -grain weight were investigated under three environmental conditions before specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) was employed to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for these five agronomic traits. Subsequently, the results were used to screen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci and candidate genes that exhibited a significant correlation with the important agronomic traits. Our analyses identified a total of 42 SNP loci that showed significant correlations with the five important agronomic flax traits. Next, candidate genes were screened in the 10 kb zone of each of the 42 SNP loci. These SNP loci were then analyzed by a more stringent screening via co-identification using both a general linear model (GLM) and a mixed linear model (MLM) as well as co-occurrences in {{at least two of the}} three environments, whereby 15 final candidate genes were obtained. Based on these results, we determined that UGT and PL are candidate genes for plant height, GRAS and XTH are candidate genes for the number of branches, Contig 1437 and LU 0019 C 12 are candidate genes for the number of fruits, and PHO 1 is a candidate gene for the 1000 -seed weight. We propose that the identified SNP loci and corresponding candidate genes might serve as a biological basis for improving crucial agronomic flax traits...|$|E
40|$|Boiling {{processes}} {{are widely used}} in technical applications. The chemical industry, power plant technology, and refrigeration engineering {{are just a few}} examples. Intensive research on pool boiling processes has been undertaken for decades. Nevertheless, the physical phenomena are still not sufficiently understood. This is mainly caused by the large number of influencing factors and the wide range of length and time scales boiling processes act on. Especially through the research on small length scales {{a better understanding of the}} underlying physical phenomena should be achieved. The subject of the present thesis is the experimental investigation of boiling processes with single bubbles and bubble interactions. In a further step, the reliability of the results obtained for a few interacting bubbles is tested on a <b>technical</b> <b>length</b> scale. Within the framework of this thesis an experimental setup is designed and fabricated. By use of optical measurement methods (black/white and infrared) the shape of the bubbles and the temperature close to the heater surface are measured simultaneously. Within the experimental setup and method emphasis is put on the validity of the obtained data (especially the infrared measurements). The test setup is based on a thin stainless steel foil used as a Joule heater. The working fluid is FC- 72. Almost all experiments are performed at subatmospheric pressure. In this thesis general results for boiling experiments with single bubbles, for example concerning the departure diameter and frequency, are presented. It is observed that for single bubbles a thin liquid layer can remain underneath a bubble after nucleation. By comparing bubble growth with and without this layer a first statement of the validity of the contact line and microlayer model is achieved. Experiments with bubbles coalescing show a clear dependency of the coalescence frequency on the system pressure, partly following a probability distribution. In comparison of a case with and without bubble coalescence an increased heat transfer is found for the coalescence case. This effect is mainly caused by hydrodynamic phenomena and sometimes also by the formation of residual droplets inside large bubbles. It is shown that the effects observed for the coalescence of two bubbles is not transferable to global boiling processes. With the help of a Monte-Carlo simulation these phenomena can be explained by different coalescence behavior. The experimental results furthermore give a possible explanation for the deviations between experimental and analytic bubble departure diameters due to the dynamic effects during bubble nucleation...|$|E
40|$|Today {{there are}} {{shortcomings}} in monitoring, control, analyses, learning and reporting {{of the results}} of activities and operations in the road management processes. There are also shortcomings in transparency and verifiability, in knowledge of road management’s costs and life cycle costs, of the road capital’s standard and condition and in measures of quality deficiency costs, productivity and maintenance backlog. The starting points for different applications of the model are taken from experience of the subprocesses in practical road management, independent analyses of activities, operations and results, presence at directors’ meetings (in an independent co-opted capacity) and literature reviews. It is my belief that the problems can largely be solved with transparent, verifiable information that is relevant to the sub-processes. A model has been designed with the transport policy’s requirements at the focus for all sub-processes’ applications without repeating errors as regards internal control, use of standard values and index adjustments. For each component, the model provides quality-related information about its current condition and condition value, acquisition value, replacement value and standard target value with the effects of measures carried out. Changes in standard and condition of new construction, improvements, maintenance and consumption can be shown in the model. Information can also be found on a component’s consumption cost, index adjustment and successively accumulated life cycle costs. Quality deficiency costs, inefficiencies, maintenance backlog, cost drivers, productivity and, for example, expected funding needs can be calculated by computer. The model has been tested and this document also describes the model’s implementation project at the SNRA. Most of the road network’s components have been registered {{for a long time in}} the SNRA’s road and traffic data bank as compulsory or optional phenomena. The remaining components will to a large extent be entered automatically. Some will require inventorying. In theory, the quality-related accounting will thus have access to information about every individual component in the entire state-administered road network. For at least 75 % (80 % in the implementation project) of the total value o fthe road capital, current condition information will exist for each individual component in the road network. The information, that constitutes “best available knowledge” of the components’ current functional condition, is administered in dedicated administration systems and comes from different kinds of inventories. The values of the remaining components can be appraised systematically on the basis of individually assessed <b>technical</b> <b>length</b> of life and, for example, planned maintenance. The model shows that decisions to carry out measures can also be based on “best available knowledge” of socioeconomic effectiveness, consideration of the environment, climate and energy in a life cycle perspective, customers’ (society’s and road-users’) expectations and political demands for fairness. These requirements are systematically worked into the limit values for “as constructed” and “worst acceptable condition”. The condition interval between the limit values shows the component’s functional consumption margin provided that the transport policy’s requirements are taken into consideration. The information makes it possible to consider and stipulate requirements regarding the development of components’ accumulated life cycle costs in procurements. Contractors will have a natural focus on increased productivity and cost increases in projects should be smaller. The model makes the long term planning process more efficient and shortens lead times. Prices, costs, accumulated life cycle costs and various types of deviations can be analysed continuously to achieve systematic learning from good examples and failures. In the project follow-up, deviations are automatically divided within the system into causes dependent on time, quantity, and unit price. Control and monitoring with analyses and learning can be made more effective through automatic monitoring against control limits. The concept of quality-related accounting of road capital should be a part of the international discussion around models for Transportation Asset Management (TAM). QC 20100772...|$|E

Brockley Abstract: The effects of factorial combinations of post-thinning density and fertilization on the growth and development of young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) were investigated in central British Co-lumbia. The effects of density and fertilization (repeated every 5 years) on tree height were small relative to the effects on stem radial growth. Tree radial growth increased with thinning intensity, whereas per-hectare growth was greatest at the highest residual density. Fertilizer effects varied across the range of residual densities tested. Tree and stand volume gains following fertilization were less, in both relative and absolute terms, at 600 trees/ha than at 1100 or 1600 trees/ha. Vigorous response of understory vegetation to nutrient additions (and strong competition for water and nutri-ents) may have reduced the effectiveness of fertilization on tree growth at 600 trees/ha relative to higher stand densi-ties. Results indicate that the combined positive effects of thinning and fertilization on the growth of young lodgepole pine will accelerate stand development, thereby shortening <b>technical</b> rotation <b>length.</b> Results also indicate that signifi-cant growth gains following fertilization of thinned lodgepole pine will partially compensate for stand volume losses due to thinning. However, fertilization may be less effective at low stand densities, where negative effects of thinning on harvest volume are greatest.

5000|$|Ludwig van Beethoven was {{familiar}} with fugal writing from childhood, as {{an important part of}} his training was playing from The Well-Tempered Clavier. During his early career in Vienna, Beethoven attracted notice for his performance of these fugues. There are fugal sections in Beethoven's early piano sonatas, and fugal writing {{is to be found in}} the second and fourth movements of the Eroica Symphony (1805). Beethoven incorporated fugues in his sonatas, and reshaped the episode's purpose and compositional technique for later generations of composers. Nevertheless, fugues did not take on a truly central role in Beethoven's work until his [...] "late period." [...] The finale of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata contains a fugue, which was practically unperformed until the late 19th century, due to its tremendous <b>technical</b> difficulty and <b>length.</b> The last movement of his Cello Sonata, Op. 102 No. 2 is a fugue, and there are fugal passages in the last movements of his piano sonatas in A major Op.101 and in A flat major Op.110. According to Rosen (1971, p. 503) [...] "With the finale of 110, Beethoven re-conceived the significance of the most traditional elements of fugue writing." ...|$|R

The syllabary also does not distinguish among syllables that end in vowels, h, or glottal stop. For example, the single symbol, Ꮡ, is used to represent su in su:dali, meaning six (ᏑᏓᎵ).

40|$|KEY COMPARISON At its {{meeting in}} October 2003, the EUROMET (now EURAMET) <b>Technical</b> Committee for <b>Length,</b> TC-L, decided upon a key {{comparison}} on diameter standards. Due {{to the large}} number of participants, it was decided to have two groups arranged according to the claimed uncertainties. Eleven laboratories from EURAMET and two laboratories from other RMOs participated in the group 1. The circulation of the gauges started in June 2005. The comparison was registered as EUROMET project 812. The final report for the group 1 describes the results of measurements of five diameter standards (one sphere, two rings and two plugs). A third plug was added for optional measurements. The main measurand was the diameter of each gauge at 20 ºC and corrected to zero force. The diameter was measured at three heights of each cylindrical gauge. As requested by the protocol, laboratories also provided the departure from roundness of the sphere. Participants were invited also to report the roundness and the straightness of the cylindrical gauges. The reference values were calculated from the weighted mean of the larger consistent subset of results according to the Birge ratio criteria. In general, the overall agreement was good, with some larger spread of results for the plugs...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{a single}} {{dendritic}} compartment The standard technical approach to realistic modeling of single neurons involves dividing the cell and especially its dendrites {{into a series}} of compartments assumed to be effectively isopotential. During simulation a single mem-brane voltage is calculated for each of these compart-ments. Recent cerebellar network and Purkinje cell single cell modeling efforts in our laboratory have suggested, however, that membrane dynamics may depend on a finer level of control of membrane voltage within the den-drite [1]. Accordingly, we have now identified the precise dendritic geometries and positions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses using serial electron microscopy. This paper describes our efforts to construct an electrical/chem-ical model of the resulting fully reconstructed segments ranging from 5 to 10 microns in <b>length.</b> <b>Technical</b> challenges Modeling these small dendritic segments realistically poses several technical challenges. Beyond issues of how to represent space, the project is also inherently multi-scale, as the behavior of segments must be interpreted {{in the context of the}} larger compartmental simulation of the dendrite, and second, at a finer scale, molecular and cellu-lar processes (Ca diffusion for example), also come into play.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the conducted research work was to {{explore the influence of}} chain length and amount of n-paraffins as well as the chemical composition of <b>technical</b> paraffins (chain <b>length</b> and amount of n- and iso-alkanes) on the thickness swelling, water absorption and internal bond strength of MDF. Pronounced differences in the sizing efficiency of n-paraffins with different chain length (C 20, C 28, C 36) were found. On using 0. 1 % paraffin (based on dried fibers) sizing efficiency increases between C 20 and C 28. Higher paraffin content (> 0. 25 %) has an insignificant influence on the swelling behaviour of MDF. In the range between 0. 1 % and 1. 0 % (solid based on dry fibers) paraffin has no negative impact on the physical-mechanical properties of the boards. The influence of paraffin chain length on the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) seems to be negligible. Further investigations were carried out using technical paraffins with different chemical composition (chain length and amount of n- and iso-alkanes) as a sizing agent for MDF. The results show that technical paraffins with a high content of long-chain-n-alkanes are more effective sizing agents than technical paraffins with low-chain-n-alkanes. Moreover, the type of used emulsifier (anionic, cationic) was also investigated. Anionic and cationic emulsifiers were equivalent in their sizing effect...|$|R

40|$|AIM The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} was to evaluate clinical, radiographic, technical, esthetic, and patient-centered outcomes of implants using two different restoration materials after 5 - 9 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 28 patients (test group: 13 patients with all-ceramic crowns on aluminum oxide-based abutments; control group: 15 patients with metal abutments on porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns). Evaluation of patient satisfaction, clinical (periodontal probing depth, bleeding on probing, plaque index, mucosal recession, and width of keratinized mucosa), esthetical (papilla index, clinical crown <b>length),</b> <b>technical</b> (loss of retention, marginal adaptation, chipping of ceramic, anatomical shape, occlusal wear, color match), and radiological parameters were assessed. The statistical analyses included comparison of all-ceramic vs. metal abutments and between the groups using Mann-Whitney U-tests. For esthetic parameters, changes over time were assessed using Friedman test and post hoc Wilcoxon test of all complete cases. RESULTS The survival rate of the restoration was 100 % in both groups. Patient's satisfaction revealed 9. 7 on the visual analog scale. A low satisfaction correlated with low ratings in color or anatomical shape. The mucosal recession in the test group was less than that in the control group. An increase in distal papilla height in the year 0 to 1, and a decrease from year 1 to 8, was detected. Sites, which received a soft tissue graft, revealed stable papillae over the observation period. Clinical crown length showed higher values in the control group. CONCLUSIONS Within {{the limitations of the}} study, it can be concluded that all-ceramic restorations reveal a high survival rate of 100 % and show no difference to metal after a mean observation period of 7. 2 years...|$|R
40|$|Our slogan is that {{defining}} length comparable {{regardless of}} direction {{is the same}} as defining angle. We temper this idealism with only one proviso, to wit the parallelogram law. An abstract vector space does not come equipped with notions of length and angle other than that one may compare vectors ‘in the same direction’: It always seems to make sense to say that the vector αv has |α | times the length of the vector v, where α is a scalar and | | is some absolute value on the field of scalars. No doubt, we also think of a non-zero vector as having nonzero length, but that plays only a concluding rôle below. Throughout, V is a vector space over a field K. We intend to restrict ourselves to subfields of R, and eventually of C. Nevertheless, to maintain the generality of our remarks, we do our best not to use properties peculiar to such fields until absolutely necessary. The field K will come accompanied with an absolute value | |, that is, a positive definite map K − → R preserving multiplication in K and obeying the triangle inequality. In mildly <b>technical</b> language, Definition. <b>Length</b> is the composition of a map V−→K respecting multiplication by scalars, and an absolute value on K. In different words, length is a map to the ordered semigroup R≥ 0 : v ↦ → ‖v ‖ with the homogeneity property (1) ‖αv ‖ = |α|‖v ‖, α ∈ K. Comparability of lengths arises from the ordering on R. In principle, we could assume that the absolute value | |, and hence length ‖ ‖, takes its values in some more general ordered ring...|$|R
