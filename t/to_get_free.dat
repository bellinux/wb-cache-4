5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free,</b> while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

Bacchus appears in a vision to a Muslim priest in Samorin's court and convinces him that the explorers are a threat. The priest spreads the warnings among the Catuals and the court, prompting Samorin to confront da Gama on his intentions. Da Gama insists that the Portuguese are traders, not buccaneers. The king then demands proof from da Gama's ships, but when he tries to return to the fleet, da Gama finds that the Catual, who has been corrupted by the Muslim leaders, refuses to lend him a boat at the harbor and holds him prisoner. Da Gama manages <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> only after agreeing to have all of the goods on the ships brought to shore to be sold.|$|E

25|$|On May 28, 1898, the ice {{went out}} on Bennett Lake. Thousands of boats took to the water within 48 hours {{and headed for the}} Dawson City. The A.J. Goddard appears to have {{departed}} Bennett on June 2, 1898, reaching Tagish Lake the next day just to return and wait for the river <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> of ice. On June 16, 1898, it departed Lake Bennett and headed for Dawson. It proceeded under its own power through the difficult stretch of Miles Canyon, only the third sternwheeler to accomplish this. It arrived in Dawson City on June 21 with ten passengers and a crew of eight as the first sternwheeler to do so in 1898. Later, {{it was one of the}} first sternwheelers to make the return trip upstream from Dawson to Whitehorse Rapids. Albert Goddard’s wife Clara accompanied him on the voyage, and was later honoured as the first female riverboat pilot on the Upper Yukon River.|$|E

Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1922 season, Goebel [...] "threw out his knee" [...] and {{was fitted}} with a steel hinge – {{an early version of}} a knee brace. However, the steel contraption {{required}} oiling and overheated when the oil dried, thus limiting Goebel's ability to play a complete game in 1922. One 1922 newspaper article described Goebel's knee brace this way: [...] "To enable Goebel to play, the Michigan trainers devised a steel brace – a hinge. This apparatus attached above and below the knee gave Goebel fairly good leg action because of the hinge. Before each game, Goebel liberally oiled the hinge <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> action because of the hinge." [...] Goebel's playing time was limited because [...] "the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing." [...] During the 1922 game against Illinois, Goebel's skin was burned by the steel.|$|E
500|$|Many {{specimens}} also {{accumulated in}} natural traps, such as sinkholes and tar pits. The Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota is a 26,000-year-old, approximately -long sinkhole that functioned for 300 to 700 years before filling with sediment. The site {{is the opposite}} scenario of that in Waco; {{all but one of}} the at least 55 skeletons—additional skeletons are excavated each year—are male, and accumulated over time rather than in a single event. It is assumed that like modern male elephants, male mammoths primarily lived alone, were more adventurous (especially young males) and more likely to encounter dangerous situations than the females. The mammoths may have been lured to the hole by warm water or vegetation near the edges, slipping in and drowning or starving. Isotope studies of growth rings have shown that most of the mammoths died during spring and summer, which may have correlated with vegetation near the sinkhole. One individual, nicknamed [...] "Murray", lies on its side, and probably died in this pose while struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free.</b> Deep footprints of mammoths attempting to free themselves from the sinkhole's mud can be seen in vertically-excavated sections of the site.|$|E
500|$|.....a {{great number}} of citizens, {{in various parts of}} the United States, are preparing, and many have {{actually}} emigrated to this Territory, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some, that, at this day, there is a great majority in favor of slavery, whilst the opposite opinion is held by others, the fact is certainly doubtful. But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory, and of citizens, too, decidedly opposed to the measure, we feel satisfied that, at all events, Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall, by the constitution, be admitted into the Union, and have a right to adopt such a constitution, in this respect, as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens.... The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong; and if Congress should think, with us, that it is wrong, that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed, your memorialists will rest satisfied that, at least, this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of the citizens of this Territory shall assume that right.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{defensive}} principles is the [...] "force". The defender marking the thrower essentially tries to force them to throw in a particular direction (to the [...] "force side" [...] or [...] "open side"), whilst making {{it difficult for them to}} throw in the opposite direction (the [...] "break side"). Downfield defenders make it hard for the receiving players <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> on the open/force side, knowing throws to the break side are less likely to be accurate. The space is divided in this way because it is very hard for the player marking the disc to stop every throw, and very hard for the downfield defenders to cover every space.|$|E

[...] His early practice was to work in conjunction with other booksellers to write, publish, and sell pamphlets and books and to exploit any furore to produce [...] "accounts" [...] and arguments. [...] For example, in 1712 the witch trial of Jane Wenham had the public's interest, and one partner wrote a pamphlet exonerating her, while another condemned her, and both pamphlets were sold at all three shops. [...] He also manufactured a set group of newspaper quarrels between the various [...] "authors" [...] for and against Mrs. Wenham <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>free</b> advertising.|$|E
