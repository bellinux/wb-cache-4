25|$|The first {{physical}} sign {{of puberty}} in girls {{is usually a}} firm, tender lump under {{the center of the}} areola of one or both breasts, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age. This is referred to as thelarche. By the widely used Tanner staging of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within six to 12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and nipples forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.|$|E
500|$|The film {{relied on}} subtext, {{requiring}} the actors to [...] "read between the lines" [...] {{for a number}} of their scenes. Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much pain there; it touches you the most when people feel something and try to hide it and you see it." ...|$|E

500|$|Filmmaker Karan Johar {{named it}} as the one film that changed his life. He said, [...] "After seeing Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! I {{realized}} Indian cinema is about values, tradition, subtlety, romance. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much soul in it. [...] I {{decided to go ahead}} and be a filmmaker only after watching this film." [...] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! belongs to a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Sholay (1975), which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance.|$|E
500|$|While mass-classifiers do not {{necessarily}} bear any semantic relationship to the noun {{with which they are}} used (e.g. box and book are not related in meaning, but one can still say [...] "a box of books"), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into categorical theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects {{solely on the basis of}} inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and prototypical theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype.|$|E

[...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much to do right where he is.|$|E

500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's as though I have found myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But in this piece <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|E

The Neighbours official website said Emilia's arrival would dig up a lot of secrets and she plays a [...] "pivotal role in Natasha's teenage angst." [...] Novakovic revealed Natasha and Emilia had met before, but Natasha was a toddler and does not remember her. The actress said Natasha and Emilia begin meeting each other in secret and get along well. Novakovic added [...] "Although when Tash mentions her mother, Emilia's reaction is quite strange.

500|$|Many leading Roman Catholics were {{appalled by}} Catherine's {{attempts}} {{to appease the}} Huguenots. After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion. The death of {{the heir to the}} throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the Catholic League. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle Cardinal Charles de Bourbon on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the treaty of Joinville with Spain, and prepared to make war on the [...] "heretics". By 1585, Henry III {{had no choice but to}} go to war against the League. As Catherine put it, [...] "peace is carried on a stick" [...] (bâton porte paix). [...] "Take care", she wrote to the king, [...] "especially about your person. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much treachery about that I die of fear." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> little to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E
500|$|He {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the International Astronomical Union in 1966; having twice edited the Union's General Assembly newsletters. He {{attempted}} to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as [...] "Why waste money on space research when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much to be done here?". He said that when asked these type of questions [...] "I know that I'm dealing with an idiot." [...] Another question that annoyed him was [...] "what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?" [...] Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and 'cranks'. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.|$|E

It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> much coke being done here." ...|$|E
