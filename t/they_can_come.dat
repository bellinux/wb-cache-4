Pumped water storage systems, such as the Dinorwig storage system in Britain, hold five or six hours of generating capacity, and are used to smooth out demand variations.|$|E

It will also include any conclusions drawn by Members whose findings differed from those of the Committee generally.

25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E

As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each passing day, but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> up with a solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, when she told him about Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Addabbo {{temporarily}} {{took over}} the role, first airing on April 6, 2001.

Despite the fan protest against the role being recast, Addabbo told Soap Opera Digest he was not worried. [...] "I don't find it intimidating," [...] he said. [...] "I know how <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> to love a certain actor portraying a role and how he plays the role and everything, but this happens in daytime so frequently that I didn't find it intimidating at all." [...] Soap Opera Digest considered him an odd choice for a Dimitri recast since Addabbo usually portrayed [...] "all-American good guys" [...] such as Generations Jason Craig and Guiding Lights Jim LeMay. A large number of All My Children fans rejected Addabbo in the role and continued to campaign for Nader's return. The controversy forced the writers to lessen Dimitri's role on the show until July 2001 when Addabbo was let go [...] "for storyline reasons", according to ABC's official statement.|$|E

500|$|The female's {{preference}} for the male mate has also been examined, in accordance to the male's size and fighting ability.

If the males are not viewed together at the same time for a comparison to be drawn by the female, the female has no particular preference. Females do benefit by mating with a larger male, as {{it has been shown that}} larger males can raise more offspring to independence, are better at chasing predators that might attack offspring, and are better at competing for breeding sites. [...] Male size may act as a more effective indicator of aggression, which may thus repel intruders before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> closer to the offspring.

500|$|Alucard {{appears in}} the sequel [...] as a {{supporting}} character. Since the game takes place centuries later, Alucard's personality and standing towards his father has drastically changed. He believes that Dracula can still be redeemed and makes it his goal to free the world from tyranny and vanquish the evil that had corrupted him and his father. He concocts a centuries spanning plan to put his father {{into a deep sleep}} by piercing his heart with the Crissaegrim sword, in order to make both the lord of the dead, Zobek and Satan himself, believe that Dracula is dead, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> out in the open. Once they do, Alucard would remove the sword so Dracula can resurrect and then destroy Zobek and Satan for good. Dracula agrees with his son's plan and awakens centuries later during modern times. Throughout the game Alucard also appears as a younger Trevor Belmont and guides Dracula through his Castle to help him recover his old powers and missing memories. In order to not draw suspicion to his plan, Alucard masquerades himself as Zobek's Lieutenant and eventually reveals his true identity to his father once he remembers their pact. They destroy Zobek and Satan and appear to be on good terms in the end. Alucard is also the protagonist of the DLC Revelations, taking place shortly prior to the events of the game.|$|E
500|$|A {{seasonal}} review {{column on}} the Anime News Network called The Stream generally made light remarks of the first four episodes. Written by Bamboo Dong, the editor called the series mindlessly fun; jokingly citing how the cell phones are always pointed directly at the demons as {{if they would be}} incapable of fighting if it were otherwise. Dong also likened the series as watching someone else play the video game. The designs of the various demons and Septentriones were described as the most interesting part of the series. On the other hand, the editor described the immense amount of [...] plot packed into the next batch of four episodes as messy. Dong also referred to the central premise as being pretty dark since it involved the main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die. The editor gave the series props for not dabbling in the destruction porn taking place since all of the widespread death around Japan is implied, but added that showing some of it would have aided the realism of the story. After reviewing twelve episodes Dong was not able to develop any interest in the characters. This continued into the series finale and Dong still felt that the characters were not fleshed out {{as much as they could}} have been. Dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how the characters reacted to a disappearing world, it was essentially dehumanizing to such an extent that their deaths carried no emotional weight. Dong presented a full series review in their Shelf Life column and expressed that viewers who like brawn, action and some emotion will enjoy the series as long as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>come</b> to terms with the fact that they'll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours.|$|E
