40|$|In {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (FMRI) statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilised temporal ltering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations, or remove them. Shaping, or "colouring", attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or "prewhitening" gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening when compared with colouring. However, {{it has been suggested that}} sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. Having performed high-pass filtering, a Tukey <b>taper</b> (<b>set</b> to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening reduced bias to to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 10...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the microleakage at the implant-abutment (I-A) interface of Morse tapered implants inoculated with different volumes of bacterial suspension. METHODS: Morse <b>tapered</b> I-A <b>sets</b> were selected and divided in two groups {{depending on the}} type of abutment: passing screw (PS) and solid (S), and then subdivided into four subgroups (n= 6) according to the suspension volume: PS 1 : 0. 1 µL; PS 3 : 0. 3 µL; PS 5 : 0. 5 µL; PS 7 : 0. 7 µL; S 1 : 0. 1 µL; S 3 : 0. > 3 µL; S 5 : 0. 5 µL and S 7 : 0. 7 µL. A control test was performed to verify the presence of external contamination during the inoculation and the implants were incubated for microbiological analysis. The microleakage was evaluated every 24 h for 7 days by the clarity of solution. After this period, the implants were disassembled for confirmation of bacterial viability. RESULTS: All the specimens with 0. 7 µL and one sample of S 5 presented turbidity in the control test indicating external contamination, and were excluded from the study. After 7 days of observation, none of the specimens presented positive results for microleakage and the bacterial viability was confirmed in all specimens. The 0. 1 µL and 0. 3 µL volumes did not present bacterial microleakage, meaning that these volumes may be inadequate for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: None of the sets evaluated showed bacterial microleakage at the I-A interface and the volume of 0. 7 µL exceeded the internal capacity of the implants...|$|R

That was the way the like things had to be with me--as I was; and it's to insult our long and perfect understanding not to feel that you have treasures of the truest interpretation of everything whatever in our common condition.

It is visibly [...] "kept up"; perhaps it is kept up too much; perhaps I am wrong in thinking so well of it. These doubts and fears course rapidly through my mind--I am easily their victim when it is a question of architecture--as they are apt to do to-day, in Italy, almost anywhere, in the presence of the beautiful, of the desecrated or the neglected. We feel at such moments as if the eye of Mr. Ruskin were upon us; we grow nervous and lose our confidence. This makes me inevitably, in talking of Venice, seek a pusillanimous safety in the trivial and the obvious. I am on firm ground in rejoicing in the little garden directly opposite our windows--it is another proof that they really show us everything- -and in feeling that the gardens of Venice would deserve a page to themselves. They are infinitely more numerous than the arriving stranger can suppose; they nestle with a charm all their own in the complications of most back-views. Some of them are exquisite, many are large, and even the scrappiest have an artful understanding, in the interest of colour, with the waterways that edge their foundations. On the small canals, in the hunt for amusement, they are the prettiest surprises of all. The tangle of plants and flowers crowds over the battered walls, the greenness makes an arrangement with the rosy sordid brick. Of all the reflected and liquefied things in Venice, and the number of these is countless, I think the lapping water loves them most. They are numerous on the Canalazzo, but wherever they occur they give a brush to the picture and in particular, it is easy to guess, give a sweetness to the house. Then the elements are complete--the trio of air and water and of things that grow. Venice without them would be too much a matter of the tides and the stones. Even the little trellises of the traghetti count charmingly as reminders, amid so much artifice, of the woodland nature of man. The vine-leaves, trained on horizontal poles, make a roof of chequered shade for the gondoliers and ferrymen, who doze there according to opportunity, or chatter or hail the approaching [...] "fare." [...] There is no [...] "hum" [...] in Venice, so that their voices travel far; they enter your windows and mingle even with your dreams. I beg the reader to believe that if I had time to go into everything, I would go into the traghetti, which have their manners and their morals, and which used to have their piety. This piety was always a madonnina, the protectress of the passage--a quaint figure of the Virgin with the red spark of a lamp at her feet. The lamps appear for the most part to have gone out, and the images doubtless have been sold for bric-a- brac. The ferrymen, for aught I know, are converted to Nihilism--a faith consistent happily with a good stroke of business. One of the figures has been left, however--the Madonnetta which gives its name to a traghetto near the Rialto. But this sweet survivor is a carven stone inserted ages ago in the corner of an old palace and doubtless difficult of removal. Pazienza, the day will come when so marketable a relic will also be extracted from its socket and purchased by the devouring American. I leave that expression, on second thought, standing; but I repent of it when I remember that it is a devouring American--a lady long resident in Venice and whose kindnesses all Venetians, as well as her country-people, know, who has rekindled some of the extinguished <b>tapers,</b> <b>setting</b> up especially the big brave Gothic shrine, of painted and gilded wood, which, on the top of its stout palo, sheds its influence on the place of passage opposite the Salute.|$|R
