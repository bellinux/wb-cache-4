5|$|In a {{gameplay}} mode {{exclusive to}} Western releases, the Arcade mode converts {{the game in}} a traditional fighting game, with all RPG elements removed and characters' abilities being stripped down to the basics to balance the playing field. Within the Arcade Mode, there are three tiers: Normal, Hard, and Time Attack; beating any tier of the Arcade mode will reward the player with PP (player points) and special items {{that can be used}} in story mode. All characters, including villains, are playable in Arcade mode; for example, Golbez, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Jecht are available for use in this mode from the start, but <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to be bought via the PP Catalog for use in other modes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{real time}} conversations are impossible, the humans send {{sections}} of the expedition's library. After reading an astronomy article, a cheela realizes that the supernova half a million human years ago created both their races. Many cheela generations later, {{but only a few}} hours for humans, cheelas develop gravity manipulation. A few generations later, a cheela spacecraft visits the human one. Although <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> extreme gravity fields to survive, the cheela can now control them precisely enough for both races to see each other face-to-face in safety. The cheela have decided that transferring their technologies, now far advanced of humans', would stunt humanity's development. However the cheela leave clues in several challenging locations, before going their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to capture the doctor. He starts to hobble away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that maybe this means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to get back to Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} premiere, [...] "Love Love Love", Blaine and Kurt {{agree to be}} boyfriends again. Blaine still wants to marry Kurt, and stages an {{elaborate}} and successful marriage proposal at Dalton Academy where he and Kurt first met, accompanied by New Directions, and all their rival show choir groups, including the Warblers. He auditions for NYADA and is accepted. New Directions comes in second at Nationals, and is disbanded by Sue for not being champions. Blaine graduates as class valedictorian, and then moves to New York to be with Kurt. They start off living together, but though they remain engaged, Blaine ultimately moves out because {{the two of them}} realize <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> their own space. The relationship between them goes through rocky patches, including Blaine's insecurity when Kurt becomes popular at school, and when an influential socialite and NYADA supporter hears Blaine perform and takes an interest in his future career, though she is not impressed by Kurt and ultimately tries to break them up, though she fails and ultimately supports them both. Their engagement is strengthened by having weathered these storms, and Blaine moves back in with Kurt.|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available to go to your child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} medical nature, colored contact lenses, similar to regular ones, are illegal to {{purchase}} in the United States without a valid prescription. Those with perfect vision can buy color contacts for cosmetic reasons, but <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> {{their eyes to}} be measured for a [...] "plano" [...] prescription, meaning one with zero vision correction. This is for safety reasons so the lenses will fit the eye without causing irritation or redness.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} baptismal regeneration, evangelicals hold baptism to be [...] "part {{of a process}} of regeneration, a step before {{eventual}} 'rebirth'." [...] Evangelical Anglicans hold a Reformed view of baptism understood in light of covenant theology in which baptism seals or pledges the blessings of the New Covenant to the individual Christian. However, regeneration is not simultaneous with baptism. In the case of infant baptism, the sacrament [...] "signifies and seals to them graces which <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to receive later by faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Pythia's curse forces Rassilon {{to find a}} new way to reproduce, {{leading him}} to create the Looms, cloning {{machines}} that can create new Gallifreyans to replace the dead. The Looms are eventually incorporated into great Houses of Cousins, to regulate the population levels and organise the new society. Time Lords are born fully grown from the Looms, although <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to be educated. [...] Though with the stories, flashbacks and depictions of the Doctor and Master as children, mentions of both the Doctor and the Master having parents, the Doctor being a self-described father or dad, the Master mentioning a daughter, the appearance of children on Gallifrey during the Time War, and the Eleventh Doctor describing a cot he brings out of the TARDIS as where he once slept, the idea of the fully grown Time Lord as well as the Looms is questionable.|$|E
50|$|Although the VDB {{had split}} from the Liberal Union {{and the other}} liberal split, the League of Free Liberals, was against {{universal}} suffrage, <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>needed</b> each other to form a liberal alternative to the Christian-democratic coalition.

2500|$|Weather {{and climate}} model gridboxes have sides of between [...] and [...] [...] A typical cumulus cloud has {{a scale of}} less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be {{represented}} physically by the equations of fluid motion. [...] Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. [...] In the earliest models, if a column of air in a model gridbox was unstable (i.e., the bottom warmer than the top) {{then it would be}} overturned, and the air in that vertical column mixed. [...] More sophisticated schemes add enhancements, recognizing that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. [...] Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between [...] and [...] can explicitly represent convective clouds, although <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to parameterize cloud microphysics. [...] The formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based, they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. [...] Still, sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account. [...] Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for cumuliform clouds, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world.|$|E
