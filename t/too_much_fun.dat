We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where we started our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun.</b> I hope he comes back." ...|$|E
500|$|Dickson debuted as the {{character}} {{within the first}} few episodes of the series. Footage of Dickson as Jill appears in the film Taxi Driver. In May 1980, Dickson left the role, with Bond Gideon briefly taking over before Adair portrayed {{the character}} for an additional three years, from 1980 to 1983. Dickson returned to the role in 1983. Melinda Fee served a temporary recast also in 1984, and Adair briefly reprised the role in 1986 as a fill-in for Dickson. In 1987, when asked if she would ever leave the character of Jill again, Dickson stated: [...] "I'm planning to branch out, maybe even a miniseries. But [...] only means shooting here at night to fill in. I can't give up Jill. I'm having <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> with her. Besides, it's all so easy." [...] However, Dickson was later replaced by Walton, with her final appearance as Jill on June 18, 1987. Walton took over shortly after on June 22, 1987.|$|E

But give the show a week to settle, and the strengths of Ullman's concept come to the fore.

500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar praised Trevor {{for being}} the first {{character}} in the series that [...] "makes sense". He stated that, upon their first playthrough of a Grand Theft Auto game, most players [...] "carjacked some poor schlub, then started doing 90mph on the sidewalk, mowing over civilians", as opposed to playing peacefully. [...] "Trevor's existence isn't a commentary on any group of people–he's just the first logical fit to the way people have been playing GTA games for the past decade," [...] he said. Sullivan concluded that Trevor {{is one of the}} few protagonists in the Grand Theft Auto that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence. Trevor has been compared to many other characters in video games and films. Calvin Khan of IGN compared Trevor to Heath Ledger's Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. Khan felt that Trevor is the only character in Grand Theft Auto V not trying to fake his persona, stating [...] "Trevor absolutely knows that he's a monster but just doesn't care. He enjoys causing misery and harm, lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy." [...] He also felt that Trevor's only reasoning for hurting people and messing everything up around him is simply because it's just <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> not to. Khan concluded saying that it's clear that the world through the eyes of Trevor is already royally broken and he sees no harm in messing it up some more, hence the reason for Trevor's actions.|$|E

She also described the character as a [...] "poisonous old cow" [...] and a [...] "cruel cook". Babe's departure appeared in an article published by Digital Spy, which compiled ten unmissable soap storylines airing the week the episode was broadcast. Its reporter, Kilkelly, warned that viewers could expect to see Babe's [...] "recent bad behaviour" [...] catching up with the Carter family. Lindsay (Metro) described Babe's final episode as [...] "dramatic" [...] and opined that he would [...] "certainly miss her antics and deliciously poisonous dialogue." [...] Kate White (Inside Soap) said that EastEnders should [...] "hang on" [...] to Babe, giving the reasons that [...] "she always makes things happen", [...] "she's genuinely very sinister" [...] and [...] "she's so entertaining", stating that her various scams show that she is [...] "totally fearless when it comes to taking on the locals" [...] and can be [...] "relied upon to generate entertaining storylines—something Walford has been short of lately". White {{went on to say that}} Babe [...] "can do more than [...] in a week with just one evil look" [...] and called her [...] "properly unhinged", saying that [...] "Babe is the sort of silent threat that many underestimate at their peril". Finally, White said that Badland had [...] "used every look and gesture to build up Babe's eccentric personality, and has been able to skip lightly frin dark to hilarious in a hearbeat. Babe has had us in stitches over the years, as well as frightening us silly. Surely you'd be mad to let go of a character that versatile?" [...] Writing about Babe's final words, where she curses the Carter family and The Queen Victoria, an Inside Soap writer said, [...] "The departing Aunt Babe, raging into the storm like some Disney witch, was the undoubted highlight of our soap week." [...] Tyler (Inside Soap) said that Babe's departure [...] "was the most wonderfully outrageous episode of EastEnders in months. Annette Badland's roar, as Babe cursed the entire Square, was camp, shameless, preposterous—and soap gold. We sincerely hope this isn't the last we see of her. Babe's revenge plot is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to waste!" ...|$|E

On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, [...] "I loved it. I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows.

[...] Reviewing the concert in Bangkok, Manta Klangboonkrong from AsiaOne commented that [...] "Showing little sign of her age, Madonna gave us what was clearly {{one of the most}} sensational concerts that's ever graced Bangkok.

5000|$|Ray Peacock (real name Ian Boldsworth) met Ed Gamble at a revue at Durham University. Their first podcast work {{together}} was the Ray Peacock Podcast, which was co-hosted with [...] "Little Raji James {{who used to}} be in EastEnders but ruined it" [...] - Peacock's actor friend, Raji James. Ed Gamble first joined the cast in episode 4 of the first series, and became a permanent host from series 2 onwards. Raji's role in the show was mainly as the butt of the jokes, with features such as [...] "Raji's Autobiography" [...] and [...] "Letters for Raji" [...] being written by Peacock and Gamble on his behalf, exaggerating traits such as his poor grammar and his floundering career. The Ray Peacock Podcast was successful, spawning live shows (attended by special guests such as Harry Hill and The Office actor Ewen MacIntosh), but ended after four series, as the presenters felt they were spending <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time making <b>fun</b> of Raji.|$|R

5000|$|The {{material}} from Level3 took {{nearly two years}} to produce and record, {{making it one of}} Perfume's longer spanning projects to date. This is due to Perfume's scheduling conflicts with studio time and live performances at concerts and gigs. The material marks Perfume's fourth consecutive studio album to be fully composed, written, and arranged by Nakata. Perfume member Nocchi revealed that Nakata only let them listen to the song compositions one day before recording it; [...] "It’s so <b>much</b> <b>fun</b> to get new material, and getting it {{on the day of the}} recording ensures a good tension. We prefer not to practice <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in advance. If we listen <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> or practice <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> before the recording, our habits tend to overcome the freshness..." [...] Perfume member A-Chan viewed Level3 as a concept album, stating [...] "We see each album as being like a concept album. So Perfume right now is at a dance music stage than straight pop. This doesn’t mean we’re going in this direction from here but this is just one of our aspects." ...|$|R
