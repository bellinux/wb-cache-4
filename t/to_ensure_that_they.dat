5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{objected to}} the {{construction}} of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the floodplains in the area was lacking, preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs.

5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November.

In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery.

In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E

Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|Private {{associations}} and country clubs have no obvious public law function, yet the courts exercise judicial review over their decisions and proceedings, such as hearings relating to disciplinary matters and those held {{to decide if}} persons should be deprived of their memberships in the associations, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are fair and {{comply with the requirements}} of natural justice. It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract. Accordingly, the courts are merely enforcing the contract rather than exercising a judicial review function.|$|E

50|$|Language {{exposure}} is {{the act of}} making language readily available to children during the critical early years of language learning. The theory of the critical period for language exposure states {{that there is a}} certain window where children are able to and must learn a first language, or multiple languages. This exposure allows the brain to fully develop linguistic skills and leads to language fluency and comprehension later in life. Much of the research on language exposure, the critical period, and language acquisition are based on spoken languages and children who are hearing. In reality, these same ideas translate to deaf children as well. Language {{exposure is}} essential during the critical period for language acquisition for all children. Unfortunately, deaf children tend to face more hardships when it comes <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will receive this input of language in formative years.|$|R
5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{could not take}} {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the short}} stories were adapted for {{publication}} in comic strip format, which were published daily in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The Living Daylights ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by Yaroslav Horak; the same pair also worked on Octopussy, which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967. The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action. The strips were reprinted by Titan Books in 1988 and then again in The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2, published in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following {{the cessation of}} hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area. During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones, <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would operate {{with a degree of}} autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups.

5|$|Detailed {{planning}} for the Tonga began in February, starting {{with the number of}} transport aircraft assigned to the operation being expanded rapidly to accommodate the entire division. Two Royal Air Force (RAF) air groups were provided for the operation to ensure that the division could be deployed in just two airlifts. The pilots and crew of these transport aircraft then began formation flying training and specialised aircrew training <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were as familiar with what the operation required of them. The 6th Airborne Division carried out several large-scale airborne exercises, using them to find {{the most efficient way to}} deploy a brigade group on one or multiple landing-zones. On 6 February, the 3rd Parachute Brigade undertook an exercise in which the entire brigade was dropped by 98 transport aircraft. At the end of March, 284 aircraft were used in Exercise 'Bizz II' in which the entire division was deployed by parachute or glider. Finally, between 21 April and 26 April, Exercise 'Mush' utilised approximately 700 aircraft to deploy the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade against the 6th Airborne Division, who moved by road, in a simulation of a full-scale airborne operation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} settlement, Augustus was also granted {{the power of}} a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the {{official}} title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded tribunicia sacrosanctitas, the immunity given to a Tribune of the Plebs. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to patricians, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the Roman censor; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a census and determine the membership of the Senate.|$|E
