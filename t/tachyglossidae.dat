2500|$|Echidnas (...) , {{sometimes}} {{known as}} spiny anteaters, {{belong to the}} family <b>Tachyglossidae</b> in the monotreme order of egg-laying mammals. The four extant species, together with the platypus, are the only surviving members of the order Monotremata and are the only living mammals that lay eggs. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, {{but they are not}} closely related to the true anteaters of the Americas. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea.|$|E
2500|$|New Guinea's {{monotremes}} {{are restricted}} to the family <b>Tachyglossidae,</b> also known as echidnas. There are four species of echidnas in two genera: the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), the eastern long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bartoni), the western long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bruijni) and Sir David's long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi). No living Zaglossus have been seen in Australia, in recent years, and this genus may now be endemic to New Guinea, although a specimen in the natural history museum was collected from the Kimberley region in the early 20th century [...] and fossils {{have been found in}} Australia.|$|E

50|$|The short-beaked echidna is {{the only}} member of its genus, sharing the family <b>Tachyglossidae</b> with the extant species of the genus Zaglossus that occur in New Guinea. Zaglossus species, which include the western long-beaked, Sir David's long-beaked and eastern long-beaked echidnas, are all {{significantly}} larger than T. aculeatus, and their diets consist mostly of worms and grubs rather than ants and termites. Species of the <b>Tachyglossidae</b> are egg-laying mammals; together with the related family Ornithorhynchidae, they are the only extant monotremes in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The Ornithorhynchidae {{are one of}} the two extant {{families}} in the order Monotremata, and contains the platypus and its extinct relatives. The other family is the <b>Tachyglossidae,</b> or echidnas. Within Ornithorhynchidae are two genera, Obdurodon and Ornithorhynchus: ...|$|E

Our phylogeny is consistent with the late appearance of undisputed fossil echidnas and platypuses. Molecular dating provided important independent corroboration, revealing that platypuses and echidnas diverged only 19 – 48 Ma, implying that Teinolophos and Steropodon (105 – 121 Ma) must lie outside the platypus–echidna dichotomy [...] . ...|$|E
