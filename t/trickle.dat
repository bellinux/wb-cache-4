5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to <b>trickle</b> charge the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can <b>trickle</b> charge the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues-influenced boogie-woogie, and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Insufficient oxygen {{transfer}} {{can result in}} anaerobic biofilms and odor generation during biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal in <b>trickling</b> filters, and can limit ammonia oxidation in nitrifying <b>trickling</b> filters. Since {{oxygen transfer}} to biofilms in plastic media <b>trickling</b> filters occurs by diffusion of oxygen through thin fluid films, previous models used solutions based on penetration theory to calculate BOD removal. However, it is shown in this paper that penetration theory is not valid for typical hydraulic onditions in <b>trickling</b> filters since oxygen can diffuse through the fluid film and reach the biofilm surface. As a result, numerical solutions are required to solve the equations describing oxygen mass transport to the biofilm. Computer models are therefore {{used to calculate the}} maximum oxygen transfer during BOD and ammonia oxidation i plastic media <b>trickling</b> filters. These models can be used by design engineers to minimize conditions that may cause odor generation i <b>trickling</b> filters, and to provide an upper limit to the efficiency of nitrifying <b>trickling</b> filters...|$|R

Meanwhile, chemical-biological methods {{were used to}} improve the phosphorus removal. It was shown that removal efficiency of CODcr, NH 3 -N, TN and TP were ideal. Compared with the traditional <b>trickling</b> filter, especially, the removal efficiency of TN and TP were respectively about 35 % and 50 % higher...|$|R

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a <b>trickle,</b> and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} improve the <b>trickling</b> filter {{performance}} by enhancing both the oxygen transfer rate and wetting percent of the media surface this was achieved using radial jet nozzle configuration instead of the conventional circular nozzle. The distributor-offset distance from the bed was taken into consideration as a geometric variable parameter. Two pilot-scale <b>trickling</b> filters were constructed on field to evaluate the effect of radial jet nozzle and offset distance on the <b>trickling</b> filter performance. Results indicated that the distribution system has major effects on the <b>trickling</b> filter performance, and that radial jet nozzle increased BOD removal ratio by approximately 10 % higher than the conventional nozzle for fixed distributor and by approximately 7 % for rotating distributor, radial jet nozzle also enhanced DO % on the filter effluent for fixed distributor but not for the rotating one. The offset distance has approximately no effect on <b>trickling</b> filter performance.

5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a <b>trickle.</b> Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by hydraulic rams, to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E
5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small <b>trickle.</b> At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E

The model is used to optimise performance of existing biofilters in terms of ammonium levels achieved and pumping costs. Observations have also been made on nitrite in recirculation systems. Concentrations of nitrite and the ratio between nitrite and ammonium vary widely in and between systems.

5|$|On Malta, the {{dissolution}} of the Roman Catholic Church under French rule had been extremely unpopular among the native Maltese population. During an auction of church property on 2 September 1798, an armed uprising had begun that had forced the French garrison, commanded by General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois, to retreat into the capital Valletta {{by the end of the}} month. The garrison, which numbered approximately 3,000 men, had limited food stocks, and efforts to bring supplies in by sea were restricted by a squadron of British and Portuguese ships stationed off the harbour. The blockade was under the command of Nelson, now Lord Nelson, based in Palermo on Sicily, and directly managed by Captain Alexander Ball on the ship of the line HMS Alexander. During 1799 a number of factors, including inadequate food production on Malta, lack of resources and troops caused by commitments elsewhere in the Mediterranean and the appearance of a French fleet under Admiral Etienne Eustache Bruix in the Western Mediterranean all contributed to lapses in the blockade. However, despite the <b>trickle</b> of supplies that reached the garrison, Vaubois' troops were beginning to suffer the effects of starvation and disease. Late in the year Ball went ashore assist the Maltese troops conducting the siege and was replaced in command of Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears <b>trickle</b> down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

This plant consists of Imhoff tank, <b>trickling</b> filter, humus tank and sludge drying beds. In this treatment plant performance of <b>trickling</b> filter was selected for detailed study. Grab samples were taken from inlet of the imhoff tank, <b>trickling</b> filter, humus tank and from the outlet of the humus tank. Grab samples were taken from 05 30 hrs. to 19 30 hrs. in two hourly intervals. Sampling was done by having a small gap between {{the first set of}} sampling and second set of sampling with the idea to see any variation in wastewater inflow patterns over a period. From the samples collected bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS) and pH were determined. The performance of the <b>trickling</b> filter was under detail study. A relationship for organic loading and <b>trickling</b> filter efficiency improved with increase of organic loading. Also a relationship of COD & BOD for the influent of <b>trickling</b> filter was obtained. With the loading pattern, the plant could be classified as a low rate tricking filter. Also this plant could treat further additional load after carrying out the suggested improvements.
