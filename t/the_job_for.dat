5|$|Although {{the club}} were founded in 1883, {{they did not}} appoint a {{full-time}} manager until 1899, when Alfred Homer, who was assistant secretary of Aston Villa, was appointed as manager-secretary of Bristol Rovers, a position he held for twenty-one years. On joining the Football League in 1920, the club appointed Ben Hall to the manager's post. Hall held <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> one year before handing over to Andrew Wilson, the club's first non-English manager.|$|E

After the auction, Marge {{encounters}} Lionel Hutz, who has become a realtor. Marge decides to try <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> herself and begins to work for Hutz at Red Blazer Realty. She tells prospective buyers her honest opinion about the houses she shows them.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats' success {{continued}} down the ballot. Meehan {{did not run}} for re-election, and the race for county sheriff pitted two incumbent city councilmen against {{each other for the}} job: Democrat William M. Lennox and Republican Cornelius S. Deegan, Jr. The office of sheriff was another holdover county office. The sheriff, whose job differed from that of the chief of police, was the chief law enforcement officer of the court. Lennox came out ahead, and would hold <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> the next twenty years.|$|E

5|$|Tomlinson {{moved to}} the Costa del Sol in Spain for 18 months from early 1996. Realising that a disgruntled former spy could be {{problematic}} for the agency, the aide-de-camp {{to the head of}} MI6 was enlisted to attempt to appease Tomlinson in February 1997. He offered him a £15,000 loan and a marketing job with Jackie Stewart's Formula One racing team, in return for a promise of silence. Tomlinson accepted the offer (he claims under duress) but retained <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> only a few months before he emigrated to Australia, where his younger brother lived.|$|E
5|$|Yet another Thayer printrun {{was needed}} in early 1853. Thayer {{was about to}} leave his Boston {{business}} for the final time, but finished <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> the Ives firm.

5|$|Brian Little, {{formerly}} {{manager of}} Aston Villa, took {{charge for the}} 1998–99 season, and Stoke began the season impressively, holding first place until December with six straight wins. The team's form tailed off in the latter stages of the season, leading to Little's departure {{at the end of}} the season. His successor, Gary Megson, was only in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding, an Icelandic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in Stoke City F.C. for £6.6m. The club's new owners appointed the club's first foreign manager, Icelander Gudjon Thordarson, in November 1999.|$|E

5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> more than a few months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
5|$|In October 1931 Alcalá Zamora and his {{interior}} minister, Miguel Maura, resigned. Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister. Desiring <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his Radical Party {{switched to}} the opposition, leaving Azaña dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected {{to the lack of}} progress. The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right. Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced. Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops. Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities. Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly improve the situation for rural workers. By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} chairmen of Malmö FF and the club's major honours from the founding of the club in 1910 to the present day. As of the start of the 2015 season, nine men have held the club chairmanship, of whom two have held <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> multiple spells. Counting each of these periods separately, there have been 12 chairmen. The most successful Malmö FF chairman in terms of trophies won is Eric Persson, under whose stewardship the side won its first 10 Swedish championships, as well as eight Svenska Cupen final victories. Persson is also the club's longest-serving chairman, having held the post for 38 years, from 1937 to 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency, stating that the spaceship has been under attack. Anthony Drake (Bryan Cranston), {{the commander of the}} station, has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation. A reluctant Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler) is the first one to voice concern over the issue, as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight. Despite these concerns, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter) is quick to take <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> financial gain. The field agents of ISIS—except Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), who is being evaluated by Doctor Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates) for medical purposes—are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight, including a flight simulator (which Archer makes Cyril crash), and weightlessness training, which causes Lana to vomit copiously {{because of the lack of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The Usual Suspects, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E

5|$|Moon {{retained}} {{the starting quarterback}} spot for two seasons, but suffered a broken collarbone halfway through his third season with the Vikings {{and was replaced by}} Brad Johnson {{for the remainder of the}} season. The Vikings had three starting quarterbacks in the following three seasons– Johnson (1997), Randall Cunningham (1998) and Jeff George (1999)– before Daunte Culpepper began a six-year spell in his second year in the NFL in 2000. He suffered a serious knee injury during the 2005 season, and Johnson took over in the position again, having re-signed the previous summer after seven years away from the franchise. Culpepper then joined the Miami Dolphins in 2006, giving Johnson another full year as starting quarterback , only to be replaced by sophomore Tarvaris Jackson in 2007. The 2008 season commenced with Jackson starting at quarterback, but he was replaced after two games by Gus Frerotte, who was returning to the Vikings from the St. Louis Rams after having been traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2005. Jackson regained <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>for</b> the final three games and led the Vikings to their first divisional title since 2000, and their first NFC North title.|$|E
