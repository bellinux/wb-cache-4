5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB connectors {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a connecting device {{in the area around}} its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E

5|$|The Icelandic {{financial}} crisis {{was a major}} economic and political event in Iceland that involved the default of {{all three of the}} country's major privately owned commercial banks in late 2008, following their difficulties in refinancing their short-term debt and a run on deposits in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> its economy, Iceland's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history.
