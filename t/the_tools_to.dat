5|$|The {{production}} of each colossal head {{must have been}} carefully planned, given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available; {{it seems likely that}} only the more powerful Olmec rulers were able to mobilise such resources. The workforce would have included sculptors, labourers, overseers, boatmen, woodworkers and other artesans producing <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> make and move the monument, in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers. The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the {{production of}} the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end.|$|E
5|$|Taibbi {{begins the}} work by quoting from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, asserting he {{predicted}} {{the onslaught of}} fake news and {{the beginnings of the}} alt-right in society. He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could ascend to the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> triumph in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E

50|$|Retrievable tools, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Slim Tools, can be retrieved and replaced using wireline through the drill string. This generally allows <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> be replaced much faster {{in case of}} failure, and it allows <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> be recovered if the drillstring becomes stuck. Retrievable tools must be much smaller, usually about 2 inches or less in diameter, though their length may be 20 ft or more. The small size is necessary for <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> fit through <b>the</b> drillstring; however, it also limits <b>the</b> <b>tool's</b> capabilities. For example, slim tools are not capable of sending data at the same rates as collar-mounted tools, and they are also more limited {{in their ability to}} communicate with, and supply electrical power <b>to,</b> other LWD <b>tools.</b>|$|R

25|$|Solving such {{problems}} {{is actually an}} easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once it’s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are well worth the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> record the trajectory information in binary format.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In recent years, to {{maximize}} the value of software testing and analysis, we have proposed the methodology of cooperative software testing and analysis (in short as cooperative testing and analysis) to enable testing and analysis <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with their users (in the form of tool-human cooperation), and enable one <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with another <b>tool</b> (in <b>the</b> form of tool-tool cooperation). Such cooperations are motivated by the observation that a tool is typically not powerful enough to address complications in testing or analysis of complex real-world software, and <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> user or another tool {{may be able to}} help out some problems faced by <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> <b>To</b> enable tool-human or tool-tool cooperation, effective mechanisms need to be developed 1) for a <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> communicate problems faced by <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> user or another tool, and 2) for <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> user or another <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> assist <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> problems. Such methodology of cooperative testing and analysis forms a new research frontier on synergistic cooperations between humans and tools along with cooperations between tools and tools. This article presents recent example advances and challenges on cooperative testing and analysis...|$|R

Kemal then persuaded the GNA to gather a National Army. The executive power was delegated to a cabinet and its speaker Mustafa Kemal. The National Army faced the Allied occupation forces and fought on three fronts: in the Franco-Turkish, Greco-Turkish and Turkish-Armenian wars.|$|E

25|$|Cases {{like these}} have created some privacy {{implications}} {{as to whether}} or not companies should have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.|$|E
40|$|By {{providing}} information about system architecture and object usage, program analysis tools can give useful assistance in understanding software systems when performing {{tasks such as}} restructuring, enhancement, and module replacement. To be most useful, these <b>tools</b> need <b>to</b> adapt easily to different source languages. However, program analysis tools are usually tailored to one particular representation of programs written in one particular source language, making adaptation to other languages costly. This thesis discusses an approach for easing the process of adapting a program analysis <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> different source languages. Our approach involves modifying <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> work with existing program representations available from compilers or other sources. As part of this modification, we restructure <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> limit its interaction with the underlying program representation to a small adaptation module interface comprised of two sets of functions: representation functions that synthesize information required by <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> about objects in the representation and language functions that determine program constructs of interest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Hiding representation and language details behind an adaptation module interface in this manner isolates the changes needed <b>to</b> adapt <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> a different program representation that supports a different language. We have applied this approach to the StarTool program analysis tool developed at UCSD. Defining an adaptation module has facilitated retargeting this <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> independent AST generators for C and Ada and to an AST representation of Tcl/Tk programs. Our work shows that defining our adaptation module interface in terms of specific requirements of StarTool, rather than in terms of general-purpose queries, significantly eases the process of retargeting <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> additional representations and languages...|$|R

The objective {{of the game is}} to track down Carmen Sandiego and her henchmen by jumping through time tunnels that link historical periods together, and correct the course of history. The player visits well-known historical events, such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence and Lewis and Clark's expedition to the Pacific Northwest, and meets historical figures including Queen Hatshepsut, William the Conqueror, and Yuri Gagarin. In each segment, or case, the player must interact with the culture and solve historical puzzles to catch Carmen's villains and retrieve the stolen item. At the end of case 18 the player locates the Chronoskimmer, thereby acquiring <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>to</b> chase and capture Carmen for the final case.|$|E
