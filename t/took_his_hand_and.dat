500|$|In November 1963 Mikoyan {{was asked}} by Khrushchev to {{represent}} the USSR at President John F. Kennedy's funeral. At the funeral ceremony, Mikoyan appeared visibly shaken by the president's death and was approached by Jacqueline Kennedy, who <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> conveyed to him the following message: [...] "Please tell Mr. Chairman [...] that I know he and my husband worked together for a peaceful world, and now he and you must carry on my husband's work." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1982, Zia {{travelled}} to Moscow {{to attend}} the funeral of Leonid Brezhnev, the late General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and new Secretary General Yuri Andropov met with Zia there. Andropov expressed indignation over Pakistan's support of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union and her satellite state, Soviet Afghanistan. Zia <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> assured him, [...] "General Secretary, believe me, Pakistan wants nothing but very {{good relations with the}} Soviet Union". According to Gromyko, Zia's sincerity convinced them, but Zia's actions didn't live up to his words.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after these}} victories, while Kléber was {{walking in the}} garden of the palace of Alfi bika, he was knifed by Soleyman El-Halaby, a Kurdish Syrian student living in Egypt. The assassin {{appeared}} to be begging from Kléber, but then <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> stabbed him in the heart, stomach, left arm, and right cheek, before running away to hide near the palace. He was soon caught, with the dagger which he had used to kill Kléber, and was later executed. The assassination happened in Cairo on 14 June 1800, coincidentally the same day on which his friend and comrade Desaix fell at Marengo. The assassin's right arm was burned off, and he was impaled in a public square in Cairo and left for several hours to die. Suleiman's skull was shipped to France and used to teach French medical students what the French authorities claimed was the bump of [...] "crime" [...] and [...] "fanaticism".|$|E
60|$|Then Skallagrim came to Eric, and, {{kneeling}} before him, <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> kissed them.|$|R
60|$|She had to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was}} no {{indication}} that he would prefer a thimble.|$|R
60|$|SHE. For my sake, Henry. After all, he's my husband. Forgive him. <b>Take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [Henry, dazed, {{lets her}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{place it in}} Teddy's].|$|R
2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child {{apparently}} did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio {{at the age of}} 11, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956, Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife, who was of paternal Sephardi Jewish descent, followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming The Bridge on the River Kwai, and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from Psalm 143, [...] "Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning".|$|E
60|$|He stopped. Crayford <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{finished}} the sentence for him.|$|E
60|$|Isabel <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him with {{grateful}} tears in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Jack {{was much}} affected, {{more by the}} countenance and manner of the sufferer, perhaps, than by his words. She drew nearer {{to the side of}} her husband's pallet, knelt, <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> said solemnly, ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Jason went boldly {{with the}} boy, {{and found the}} two princesses standing; and when Chalciope saw him she wept, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> cried—‘O cousin of my beloved, go home before you die!’ ...|$|R
60|$|GLORIA (at {{the other}} side of McComas). How do you do, Mr. McComas? (He turns; <b>and</b> she <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> presses it, with a frank {{straight}} look into his eyes.) We are glad to meet you at last.|$|R
60|$|SHE <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{began with}} all the art of persuasion that she possessed.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked a}} little wistfully at him as she <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> held it.|$|E
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{holding it}} {{looked into his}} eyes with a little smile.|$|E
60|$|Isobel never hesitated. I {{think that}} instinctively she {{accepted}} him without demur. Her eyes flashed {{back to him}} all those nameless things which his own greeting had left unspoken. She <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> looked him frankly in the face.|$|R
60|$|The dumb child gazed {{as if he}} {{read their}} faces, and was begging to remain; he gladly allowed Violet to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> she led him away, {{inviting}} Theodora to come and give her own directions about him to Susan, the girl from Brogden.|$|R
6000|$|CAESAR (moved). Well said. Ungrateful that I am, I {{was about}} to set you free; but now I will not part from you for a million talents. (He claps him {{friendly}} on the shoulder. Britannus, gratified, but a trifle shamefaced, <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> kisses it sheepishly.) ...|$|R
60|$|Gently she <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> at the act {{he smiled}} at her very weakly.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{approached}} the bedside with boyish obedience. Pendleton <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{gazed at him}} critically.|$|E
60|$|She smiled pleasantly, quietly <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> pressed it, {{then turned}} back into the drawing-room.|$|E
60|$|He stood, {{long after}} I {{had ceased to}} read, still looking at me. At length I ventured to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> to entreat him, as well as I could, to {{endeavour}} to get some command of himself. He replied, 'I thankee, sir, I thankee!' without moving.|$|R
6000|$|She has <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> {{is looking}} into his face, and she goes on speaking. [...] "I have thought of you so often in all these bitter years--it {{sustained}} me even at the worst--and I knew, John, that it was for my sake that you had never married----" ...|$|R
50|$|Later at Joe's, Apollo {{sits with}} Dee while Starbuck and Anders {{sit at the}} bar. Apollo tries to {{reconcile}} {{his relationship with his}} wife, but periodically makes eye contact with Starbuck. Dee <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> he tells her {{that he did not know}} what it meant to love her until he was going to lose her.|$|R
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him, {{and her own}} eyes were filled with tears.|$|E
60|$|As he {{made that}} answer, Midwinter <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> led him round the last turn in the path.|$|E
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{spoke to}} him--with marked forbearance, {{but without the}} {{slightest}} sign of emotion on her side.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head wistfully, but she was glad that Tommy would fain have {{had one of the}} Saturdays back. Had he waxed sentimental she would not have gone a step of the way with him into the past, but when he was so full of glee she could <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> run back into it.|$|R
60|$|Nanny <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> timidly, <b>and</b> {{would have}} kissed it {{had he been}} less than a minister.|$|R
60|$|The Chevalier {{would have}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> condoled with {{him over the}} horrible story; but he drew back, repeating {{that he had seen}} Widow Laurent's house, and that he saw that some parts of the man's story were so much falsified that he could not believe the rest. Moreover, he knew that Eustacie had not been in the town {{at the time of the}} siege.|$|R
60|$|She <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> wrung it hard--as if {{she would}} wring the answer out of him in that way.|$|E
60|$|He {{handed the}} paper to Zaki, who <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> raised it to his forehead, with tears in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Miss Vane was {{standing}} at the door with his wife when Sewell came out. She <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> pressed it.|$|E
60|$|Stephen <b>took</b> <b>his</b> brother's <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{gave it a}} good grip; and, Cecilia coming in, {{they all}} sat down.|$|R
6000|$|I paused. He made no answer: I {{could see}} that he was {{secretly}} struggling with himself. Had I ventured too far? Had I overestimated the strength of my influence? My heart beat fast, my voice faltered--but I summoned courage enough to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> to make a last appeal to him. [...] "Eustace," [...] I said; [...] "don't you know me yet well enough to trust me?" ...|$|R
50|$|Suddenly, Arun hears a {{soft voice}} from behind. It is a woman in white saree. She looks pale and has dark kind eyes. She wears no jewels. After a brief introduction, she invites Arun for some {{refreshment}} at the station dining room. She <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> leads him away. Arun does not refuse the invitation as he feels {{it would be too}} impolite to reject it. The woman seems to take a pleasure in watching him eat.|$|R
