5|$|The {{depression}} of the 1930s brought mass unemployment to Sunderland. But, for <b>the</b> <b>Echo,</b> {{it was also a}} time of important structural changes in ownership. A new company controlling the three titles owned by the Storey family was formed in 1934—Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd. There was a change in name for <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> too, when the word Daily was dropped from its title of Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette. The decade also, however, brought a fire which destroyed most of the bound files of archive copies of <b>the</b> <b>Echo.</b> Nineteenth-century editions of <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> can only be accessed in Sunderland at the City Centre Library in Fawcett Street.|$|E
5|$|Bridge Street {{remained}} {{the home of}} <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> for the next 100years. Old buildings were demolished, new machine and composing rooms built on West Wear Street and two rotary presses installed just before the move, each capable of printing 24,000copies an hour. These changes brought about increased circulation, but it took another seven years before <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> made a profit. It {{was a time of}} intense competition; the Sunderland Times converted from a bi-weekly to a daily paper in the same month as <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> moved to Bridge Street, and Tory supporters started a paper of their own, the Sunderland Daily Post. The Sunderland Times was the first to collapse, but the Post survived for the next quarter of a century, providing <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> with an often bitter rival.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} a break in {{tradition}} when <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> title-piece appeared reversed out in white on a red background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming <b>The</b> <b>Echo.</b> This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E

5|$|The Second World War brought havoc to Wearside, with Sunderland one of {{the seven}} most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy {{shelling}} of the North East coast and River Wear, <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The Shields Gazette, the Echo's nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, South Shields, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> presses. <b>The</b> <b>Echo</b> continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper rationing, a lack of reporters and a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the Echo—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on newsprint reduced the former broadsheet to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} the 2015 study which {{resolved}} the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton's parakeet, due to their close evolutionary relationship. <b>The</b> <b>echo</b> parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s, numbering only twenty individuals, but has since recovered, so introducing it to the nearby islands could also help secure the survival of this species.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural {{edition of}} <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> was printed in Press Lane, Sunderland on 22 December 1873; 1,000 copies were {{produced}} and sold for a halfpenny each. <b>The</b> <b>Echo</b> survived intense competition {{in its early}} years, {{as well as the}} depression of the 1930s and two World Wars. Sunderland was heavily bombed in the Second World War and, although <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> building was undamaged, it was forced to print its competitor's paper under wartime rules. It was during this time that the paper's format changed, from a broadsheet to its current tabloid layout, because of national newsprint shortages.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Echo</b> has won {{numerous}} accolades, as well {{as government}} praise, for its campaigning journalism, specialist writing, community work, photographic images and appeals for good causes over the decades. Examples of notable writing include a 2006 campaign highlighting {{the threat posed by}} bogus callers to the elderly and a 2005 campaign to protect 999 crews from being attacked on duty, which both received official praise in Parliament. A 1996 drug education campaign, which included the creation of a telephone service for tip-offs about suspected local drug dealers, was also highly praised. The Newspaper Society named <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> as its Campaigning Newspaper of the Year for the Drug Busters drive, and the campaign also won an award from the International Newspaper Marketing Association.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Echo</b> {{moved from}} Bridge Street to a {{purpose-built}} newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought {{an end to}} the traditional methods of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw <b>the</b> <b>Echo</b> become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw a change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> from the target is received while the transmitter is still sending, <b>the</b> <b>echo</b> will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
