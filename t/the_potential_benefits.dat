5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} the Ottoman Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877â€“1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman Army {{embarked}} on a series of territorial conquests in the Caucasus beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by the Russians in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic advantage to the Ottoman Empire, compared with <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> of military success in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Ottoman Army's war effort in 1918 turned from Palestine to Anatolia, to the provinces and territories lost by their empire between 1877 and 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. This change of {{direction}} was heavily influenced by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed in March 1918 which ended the war on the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and the Central Powers. As a result, the Ottoman Army embarked {{on a series of}} territorial conquests in the Caucasus. Erzerum, which had been captured by the Russians during the Erzerum Offensive in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. The reoccupation of these former Ottoman possessions, however, brought little strategic advantage, compared with <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> of military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

25|$|Education held special {{significance}} for a socialist of Wilson's generation, {{in view of}} its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> of scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, {{for the first time}} in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence. Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the Robbins Report, a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.|$|E
25|$|In SCNT, {{not all of}} {{the donor}} cell's genetic {{information}} is transferred, as the donor cell's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus. This fact may also hamper <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> of SCNT derived tissues/organs for therapy, as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant.|$|E
25|$|Number 92250 was {{equipped}} with a Giesl ejector in which the exhaust steam was divided between seven nozzles arranged in a row on the locomotive's longitudinal axis and directed into a narrow fan-shaped ejector that more intimately mixed it with the smokebox gases than {{is the case of}} an ordinary chimney. This offered the same level of draught for a reduced level of exhaust back-pressure or, alternatively, increased draught with no performance loss elsewhere. Again, great claims were made as to <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits,</b> and 92250 retained the variant chimney until withdrawal, though no benefit was noticeable.|$|E

Animal studies did not show embryo or fetal toxicity at doses that were 1.2 and 0.7 times the human dose. However, delayed fetal maturation was observed at a dose that was 3.5 times the human dose. While dalbavancin is excreted in rat milk, it is unknown if it is excreted in human milk.

25|$|Prostate cancer {{screening}} is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection {{but does not}} decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due {{to the risk of}} overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits</b> of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5Î±-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not appear to affect the risk.|$|E
25|$|For some populations, {{access to}} {{healthcare}} and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits.</b> Costa Rica, for example, has demonstrable health spatial inequities with 12â€“14% {{of the population}} living in areas where healthcare is inaccessible. Inequity has decreased {{in some areas of}} the nation {{as a result of the}} work of healthcare reform programs, however those regions not served by the programs have experienced a slight increase in inequity.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian {{cancer has}} low prevalence, {{even in the}} high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and {{screening}} of women with average risk {{is more likely to}} give ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>benefits.</b> The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it {{is more likely to be}} treated successfully.|$|E
