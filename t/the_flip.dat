5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With <b>the</b> <b>flip,</b> NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E

Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman then rescues both Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with <b>the</b> <b>flip</b> of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to Arkham Asylum and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is.

Recent {{advances}} in ideology and in method have unlocked {{new directions for}} education research. <b>The</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom is considered as the most attractive way in this discussion. <b>The</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom is a new pedagogical method, which swaps the arrangement of knowledge imparting and knowledge internalization comparing to traditional classroom. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that student learning is improved for <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> compared to traditional classroom, it is still an open issue. According to the survey of the prior and ongoing research of <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom, we found that <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom still {{has a lot of}} room for improvement. In this paper, with an example of computer courses teaching at universities, we study a designing method of classroom interaction, design a test method of teaching effect, and construct a fully functional online learning system and a video recording platform.

In the field of ophthalmology, although many {{attempts have been made}} to address the problem of the decreasing teaching time and the increasing load of course content, a growing body of literature indicates the need to reform the current ophthalmology teaching strategies.

However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> classroom in ophthalmology education. This study, for the first time, assesses <b>the</b> use of <b>flipped</b> classroom in ophthalmology, specifically glaucoma and ocular trauma clerkship teaching.

One group took <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> glaucoma classroom and lecture-based ocular trauma classroom, while the other group took <b>the</b> <b>flipped</b> ocular trauma classroom and lecture-based glaucoma classroom. In the traditional lecture-based classroom, students attended the didactic lecture and did the homework after class.

Both the teachers and students were asked to complete feedback questionnaires after the classroom. We found that the two groups did not show differences in the final exam scores.
