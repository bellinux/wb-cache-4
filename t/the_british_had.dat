5|$|After the Malayan {{conflict}} {{ended in}} 1960, the U.S. considered the British precedent in deciding {{that the use}} of defoliants was a legal tactic of warfare.

5|$|As {{the night}} wore on, {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the Pashtun forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} the radar chain was also difficult. The stations were indeed vulnerable to dive bombers and low flying aircraft, however <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> mobile units {{which could be}} moved around to cover any gaps. Rapid repair services were also quick. Rarely were radar stations out of action {{for more than a}} few days.|$|E

5|$|The war {{was mostly}} a mopping-up {{operation}} intended {{to complete the}} expansion of the earlier Anglo-Maratha war, which was stopped due to economic concerns of the British. The war began as a campaign against the Pindaris. Seeing that the British were in conflict with the Pindaris, the Peshwa's forces attacked the British at 16:00 on 5 November 1817 with the Maratha left attacking the British right. The Maratha forces comprised 20,000 cavalry, 8,000 infantry, and 20 guns whereas <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 infantry, and eight guns. On the Maratha side, an additional 5,000 horse and 1,000 infantry were guarding the Peshwa at Parvati Hill. The British numbers include Captain Ford's unit, which was en route from Dapodi to Khadki. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> also asked General Smith to come to Khadki for the battle but they did not anticipate he would arrive in time.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from his command bunker, so {{even though he was}} able to get two of his guns back in action, he was unable to direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> left it undefended.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the war, the power of the British East India Company was on the rise, whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline (although they had only ruled for a very short duration, may be the reason was they never had {{intellectual}} capabilities and could only defeat Mughals when there was no great king left) <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> been victorious in the previous Anglo-Maratha war and Hindu Brahmin Marathas were at their mercy. The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II. Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province. Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection. The envoy, Gangadhar Shastri, was under British protection. He was murdered, and the Peshwa's minister Trimbak Dengle was suspected of the crime.|$|E
5|$|Both fleets were {{at first}} {{hampered}} by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes {{lined up for}} battle and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up in a similar formation, Suffren gave the order to attack, and battle began shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted around three hours and resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944.

5|$|Details of the {{forthcoming}} peace treaty arrived late in 1782. The Ohio Country, the land that the British and Indians had successfully defended, had been signed away by Great Britain to the United States. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> not consulted the Indians in the peace process, and the Indians were nowhere mentioned in the treaty's terms. For the Indians, the struggle with American settlers would resume in the Northwest Indian War, though this time without the assistance of their British allies.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command. Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine {{that there was not}} a single U-boat in the vicinity of Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia. They claimed instead that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war on the side of the Allies.|$|E
5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948.

They also claimed that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
5|$|In December 1915, Tubantia again made {{news when}} the Overseas News Agency in Berlin {{released}} a report saying that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> seized all South America mail and parcels from the ship.

50|$|Krüger, being {{suspicious}} of <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>has</b> his own plans.

Hence, ultimately, Krüger tricks <b>the</b> <b>British</b> by signing <b>the</b> treaty. This impresses some of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> as they find Krüger is their equal in matters of cunning, {{which is supposed to}} be the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>British.</b> <b>Having</b> been outmaneuvered, Rhodes tries to buy Krüger's allegiance. Krüger and his wife Sanna (Lucie Höflich), however, are incorruptible. After being rejected, Rhodes shows Krüger a long list of members of the Boer council who work for <b>the</b> <b>British.</b> Krüger then becomes convinced that war is inevitable if the Boers are to keep their land. He declares war.|$|R
5|$|On September 30, the French {{attacked}} the British Fusiliers redoubt. The skirmish lasted two hours, {{in which the}} French were repulsed suffering several casualties. On October 1, the allies learned from British deserters that, to preserve their food, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>had</b> slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach. In the American camp, thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks. Preparations for the parallel also began.|$|E
