5|$|Drizzt is {{the main}} {{character}} in only two books of the Paths of Darkness series. The Silent Blade (1998) describes the group's journey to permanently destroy the Crystal Shard. Sea of Swords (2001) continues Drizzt's story after the events of <b>The</b> <b>Spine</b> <b>of</b> the World (1999), which focuses on Wulfgar, and Servant of the Shard (2000), which has Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle as the main characters. Sea of Swords covers the companions' search for Wulfgar's lost magical warhammer, Aegis-fang, and the reunion of the group after an extended separation.|$|E
5|$|It {{is crucial}} for these {{definitions}} that edges are only allowed to stay within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{existence}} of a three-page book embedding of a graph, given a fixed ordering of the vertices along <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the embedding, has unknown computational complexity: it is neither known to be solvable in polynomial time nor known to be NP-hard. And, although every planar graph has book thickness at most four, it is unknown whether there exists a planar graph whose book thickness is exactly four.|$|E
50|$|M. henrikseni {{has been}} shown to be part of the {{carapace}} of a bivalved bradoriid arthropod. However, the affinity of M. squamifer is still unresolved; the genus may transpire to be a form taxon, which would require M. henrikseni to be re-classified into a new genus. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> M. henrikseni, which flare out at the base where they attach to <b>the</b> cuticle, <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> M. squamifer are more parallel-sided, with the fossil material becoming thinner towards the base: consistent with their attachment to non-mineralized cuticle. M. squamifer spines appear to have formed in pairs, owing to their symmetry; on this basis they have been likened to <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> certain armoured lobopods known from Burgess shale-type deposits. This speculative claim has been substantiated for some material attributed to Mongolitubulus, based on similarities with <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hallucigeniid lobopodians.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first pharyngeal arch and usually attached to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the sphenoid bone, may be found attached to {{the rim of the}} foramen.|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} is a foramen through the sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle cranial fossa. It {{is one of two}} foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of these two cranial foramina, situated directly anterior and medial to the foramen spinosum. <b>The</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the foramen. Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular fossa, and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} {{is one of}} two {{foramina}} located in the base of the human skull, on the sphenoid bone. It is situated just anterior to <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the sphenoid bone, and just lateral to the foramen ovale. The middle meningeal artery, middle meningeal vein, and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve pass through the foramen.|$|E

5|$|As {{the size}} of the AEF grew, the {{division}} was placed under command of I Corps in July. When the Aisne-Marne campaign began shortly thereafter, the division, under I Corps was placed under command of the French Sixth Army protecting its east flank. When the offensive began, the division advanced up <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> the Marne salient for several weeks, pushing through Belleau Wood, moving 10 miles from 18 to 25 July. On 12 August it was pulled from the lines near Toul to prepare for the next offensive. The division was then a part of the offensive at St. Mihiel, during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. The division then moved in position for the last major offensive of the war, at Meuse-Argonne. This campaign was the last of the war, as an armistice was signed shortly thereafter. During World War I the 26th Division spent 210 days in combat, and suffered 1,587 killed in action and 12,077 wounded in action. The division returned to the United States and was demobilized on 3 May 1919 at Camp Devens, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed <b>the</b> <b>spine</b> <b>of</b> Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} we {{establish}} the relation between <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> 3 -manifolds and the polyhedra with identified faces.

30|$|In this experiment, {{since it}} was {{difficult}} to obtain <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human cadavers, <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> boar cadavers were used instead. The advantages on the use <b>of</b> cadaveric boar <b>spines</b> are that <b>the</b> resource of destructive animals can be utilized effectively and that <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> can be obtained easily at very low price. The disadvantage is that the anatomy of the vertebral body <b>of</b> boar <b>spines</b> is significantly different to those of humans. Thus, the results should be interpreted as a proportion or trend rather than quantitatively as angles or ROM (Wasinpongwanich et al. 2014). We would like to perform the same experiment using <b>the</b> <b>spines</b> <b>of</b> human cadavers and conduct a detailed study on rotational micromovement between the pedicle screw and vertebral body by attempting to create a model using the finite element method in the future.
