25|$|Office 2007 {{introduced}} a new graphical user interface called the Fluent User Interface, which uses ribbons and an Office menu instead of menu bars and <b>toolbars.</b> Office 2007 also introduced Office Open XML file formats as the default file formats in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. The new formats are intended to facilitate the sharing of information between programs, improve security, {{reduce the size of}} documents, and enable new recovery scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Browser Helper Objects {{are also}} used by many search engine {{companies}} and third parties for creating add-ons that access their services, such as search engine <b>toolbars.</b> Because {{of the use of}} COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, {{there are a number of}} Internet Explorer shells, and a number of content-centric applications like RealPlayer also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.|$|E
50|$|As of 2014, {{there are}} {{numerous}} reports dating back to 2012 that the AVG SafeGuard <b>Toolbar</b> installs itself {{without the consent of}} the user, as a side effect of installing other applications. The <b>toolbar</b> program appears to cause significant RAM issues and can be considered an intrusive potentially unwanted program (PUP). Once installed, the AVG <b>toolbar</b> is virtually impossible to remove. The <b>toolbar</b> uninstaller does not function, instead re-installing the add-on if manually removed. Consequently, many discussions and blog posts have described complex procedures for removal of the AVG <b>toolbar,</b> each with very mixed results.|$|R

50|$|The Yahoo! <b>Toolbar</b> has a {{well known}} and dark history of being bundled with other software. The <b>toolbar</b> often {{installs}} itself without the user's knowledge or consent. Yahoo! is known for paying developers to place the <b>toolbar</b> into programs {{in such a way}} that inexperienced users may unwillingly install it. Installation of the <b>toolbar</b> can result in changes to the browser homepage, default search engine, and web-tracking preferences.|$|R
25|$|The Quick Access toolbar (by default) sits in {{the title}} bar {{and serves as a}} {{repository}} of most used functions, such as save, undo/redo and print. It is customizable, although this feature is limited, compared to <b>toolbars</b> in previous Office versions. Any command available in the entire Office application can be added to the Quick Access toolbar, including commands not available on the ribbon as well as macros. Keyboard shortcuts for any of the commands on the toolbar are also fully customizable, similar to previous Office versions.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon, a {{panel that}} houses a fixed {{arrangement}} of command buttons and icons, organizes commands {{as a set}} of tabs, each grouping relevant commands. The ribbon is present in Microsoft Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Access 2007 and some Outlook 2007 windows. The ribbon is not user customizable in Office 2007. Each application has a different set of tabs that exposes functions that the application offers. For example, while Excel has a tab for the graphing capabilities, Word does not; instead it has tabs to control the formatting of a text document. Within each tab, various related options may be grouped together. The ribbon is designed to make the features of the application more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse clicks as compared to the menu-based UI used prior to Office 2007. Moving the mouse scroll wheel while on any of the tabs on the ribbon cycles—through the tabs. The ribbon can be minimized by double clicking the active section's title, such as the Home text in the picture below. Office 2007 does not natively support removing, modifying or replacing ribbon. Third party add-ins, however, can bring menus and <b>toolbars</b> back to Office 2007 or customize the ribbon commands. Add-ins that restore menus and <b>toolbars</b> include Classic Menu for Office, ToolbarToggle, and Ubitmenu. Others like RibbonCustomizer enable the customization of ribbons. Office 2010 does allow user customization of the ribbon out of the box.|$|E
25|$|Internet Explorer exposes {{a set of}} Component Object Model (COM) {{interfaces}} {{that allows}} add-ons to extend the functionality of the browser. Extensibility {{is divided into two}} types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries, <b>toolbars,</b> menu items or Browser Helper Objects (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats. It allows Internet Explorer to handle new file formats and new protocols, e.g. WebM or SPDY. In addition, web pages can integrate widgets known as ActiveX controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight are examples. Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.|$|E
40|$|Both <b>toolbar</b> and {{dropdown}} menu {{are used}} popularly in a {{graphical user interface}} with a similar objective of providing {{easy access to the}} internal functions. Often the same functions are provided through both menu and <b>toolbar.</b> Both <b>toolbar</b> and dropdown menu have their own advantages and disadvantages. A menu can provide more options occupying less real estate, while <b>toolbar</b> can provide a single click access without navigating through trees and branches. As a menu and <b>toolbar</b> system shares many common objectives, it is often useful maintain some relationship to coordinate between both the elements of a GUI system. The relationships can be easy as both of them often share the same internal function. For example, the print option in a menu will (most likely) call the same function as the print button on the <b>toolbar.</b> This article discusses the similarities and differences between a dropdown menu and <b>toolbar.</b> Five inventions trying to focus on both menu and <b>toolbar</b> are illustrated in the article.

25|$|Visual Studio {{does not}} support any {{programming}} language, solution or tool intrinsically; instead, it allows the plugging of functionality coded as a VSPackage. When installed, the functionality is available as a Service. The IDE provides three services: SVsSolution, which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions; SVsUIShell, which provides windowing and UI functionality (including tabs, <b>toolbars</b> and tool windows); and SVsShell, which deals with registration of VSPackages. In addition, the IDE is also responsible for coordinating and enabling communication between services. All editors, designers, project types and other tools are implemented as VSPackages. Visual Studio uses COM to access the VSPackages. The Visual Studio SDK also includes the Managed Package Framework (MPF), which {{is a set of}} managed wrappers around the COM-interfaces that allow the Packages to be written in any CLI compliant language. However, MPF does not provide all the functionality exposed by the Visual Studio COM interfaces.|$|E

Konqueror offers increased loading speed by prefetching domain name data in KHTML. A find-as-you-type bar improves navigation in webpages. KMail has a new message header list, and reworked attachment view. The KWrite and Kate text editors can now operate in Vi input mode, accommodating those used to the traditional UNIX editor. Ark, the archiving tool has gained support for password-protected archives and is accessible via a context menu from the file managers now. KRDC, the remote desktop client improves support for Microsoft’s Active Directory through LDAP. Kontact has gained a new planner summary and support for drag and drop in the free/busy view. KSnapshot now uses the window title when saving screenshots, {{making it easier to}} index them using search engines.|$|E
