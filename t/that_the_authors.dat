5|$|Despite {{the widely}} held view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other (the {{so-called}} synoptic problem), other scholars {{take it as}} significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|A {{positive}} capsule {{review in}} the Los Angeles Times noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> use logic to point out transparencies in the assertions of Transcendental Meditation. John Horgan, in his book Rational Mysticism, questions Persinger's neutrality and says that in his book he treats religious beliefs and spiritual practices as mental illness.|$|E
5|$|A {{review in}} The Economist calls this a {{powerful}} book which articulates the politics involved {{and the degree}} to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.|$|E

50|$|Interpretive Stage: The {{second stage}} of {{analytical}} reading involves constructing <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> arguments. This first requires the reader to note and understand any special phrases and terms <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> uses. Once <b>that</b> is done, Adler says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reader should find and work to understand each proposition <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> advances, as well as <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> support for those propositions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>author</b> wrote <b>that</b> Enishi's {{admiration for}} his sister, obsession, and hatred for Kenshin {{reflects}} [...] "Watsuki's dark side"; <b>the</b> <b>author</b> added <b>that</b> {{he has no}} older sister and no people that he feels a need to take revenge on. Since Shishio has aspects within Watsuki <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> considers to be positive, Enishi has Watsuki aspects <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> feels are negative.|$|R
5|$|The {{statements}} {{cited by}} Universal {{recognize that the}} Donkey Kong theme loosely evokes the King Kong films.

5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement {{to write a book}} refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, for more than a century, Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic {{with the help of}} a research assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 it was published in Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.|$|E
50|$|In this example, Id in {{the second}} {{citation}} indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> is identical to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> previous citation. <b>That</b> is, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of <b>the</b> second citation is also Macgillivray, J. A.|$|R
50|$|Mechanics (or Mechanica or Mechanical Problems; Μηχανικά) is a text {{traditionally}} {{attributed to}} Aristotle, though his authorship {{of it is}} disputed. Thomas Winter has suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was Archytas. However, Coxhead {{says that it is}} only possible to conclude <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was one of the Peripatetics.|$|R

5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{a number of}} new ideas in the field of human geography and social organization models, that had been developed in the western world during the 18th century. Among the sources <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> used to compose Geographia Neoteriki, were the Géographie Moderne by Nicolle de La Croix, the Géographie Ancienne, and the Géographie Moderne, which were part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke. Additionally, the authors had personally examined the areas described in the work. This element served both as the work's primary organizing mode as well as the basis for their historical approach.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Marshall {{departed}} for Philadelphia, the temporary national capital, George Muter and Benjamin Sebastian, both justices of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, published a pamphlet stating that Marshall had perjured {{himself in a}} Court of Appeals case between himself and James Wilkinson. No known copies of the pamphlet are extant, and related surviving documents do not relate {{the exact nature of}} the charges. Marshall, being out of the state, was unable to reply immediately to the charges, and his enemies in the General Assembly drafted a memorial to the U.S. Senate requesting an investigation of the charges. On December 16, 1795, the memorial was approved by the General Assembly and transmitted to the Senate. The Senate appointed a committee to recommend action on the memorial, and the committee found that the charges against Marshall were not specific, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> had provided no evidence upon which to evaluate the charges, that no one was empowered to prosecute the charges in the Senate, and that further action by the Senate was inappropriate. On March 22, 1796, the Senate approved the committee's report by a vote of 168. Muter and Sebastian never filed formal charges against Marshall for perjury.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> {{would prefer a}} peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E
50|$|Duchesne {{and others}} believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of <b>the</b> first {{addition}} to the Liber Pontificalis was a contemporary of Pope Silverius (536-537), and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of another (not necessarily the second) addition was a contemporary of Pope Conon (686-687), with later popes being added individually and during their reigns or shortly after their deaths.|$|R
50|$|All modern editions or {{translations}} of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, {{in addition to}} or instead of page numbers. Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author's</b> citations can be checked by readers without having {{to use the same}} edition or translation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> used.|$|R
50|$|It {{is evident}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of Inventio, if he {{actually}} travelled {{to the far}} north, did not actually reach the North Pole, which in no way resembles the description found in the book. However, it is likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was speculating as {{to the source of}} the powerful magnetic force <b>that</b> underlies <b>the</b> functioning of the compass.|$|R

25|$|Since {{style of}} the text is plain, and there are {{numerous}} ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often of Persian origin, {{it has been suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> of the encyclopedia were of Persian descent.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{scholars}} {{view this}} as an eponymous metaphor. Asher {{is one of the}} two descendants of Zilpah, originally a handmaid of Leah, the other being Gad; critical scholars claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> intended this to mean Asher and Gad were not of entirely of Israelite origin.|$|E

50|$|As {{the poem}} is written to glorify King Trailokanat , most {{authorities}} agree that it was written {{before the end of}} his reign (1488) and probably very soon after the battle. MR Suphawat Kasemsi proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was a monk named Panya Phaisan whose name appears in stanza 58 as เบญญาพิศาล. Wipha Konkanan proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was female on grounds that a female pronoun is used, but others consider this unlikely. Phra Borihan Thepthani proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was a son of King Trailokanat who spent {{a long time in the}} monkhood as Phra Suriyawong. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab accepted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> authorship cannot be known for sure.|$|R

25|$|In May 2007, {{a public}} conference was {{scheduled}} in Bulgaria by Martina Baleva and Ulf Brunnbauer aiming to present research {{in an effort}} to form the official report of the events of the Batak Massacre.

25|$|A 2012 {{paper in}} the Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences {{suggested}} that Paul’s conversion experience might be understood as involving psychogenic events. This occurring in the overall context of Paul’s other auditory and visual experiences <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> propose may {{have been caused by}} mood disorder associated psychotic spectrum symptoms.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary goal}} behind article {{marketing}} {{is to get}} search engine traffic to <b>the</b> article so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> can strengthen their authority and influence within their field, while also leveraging that traffic for their own site(s).

25|$|The Yoga Sūtras text is {{attributed}} to Patanjali. Much confusion surrounds this Patañjali, because an author {{of the same name}} is credited to be the author of the classic text on Sanskrit grammar named Mahābhāṣya. Yet the two works in Sanskrit are completely different in subject matter. Furthermore, before the time of Bhoja (11th century), no known text states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> were the same.|$|E
25|$|In late September 2006, {{a team of}} ornithologists from Auburn University and the University of Windsor {{published}} reports of their own sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers along the Choctawhatchee River in northwest Florida, beginning in 2005. These reports were accompanied by evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> themselves considered suggestive {{for the existence of}} ivory-billed woodpeckers. Searches in this area of Florida through 2009 failed to produce definitive confirmation.|$|E
25|$|The first mandala is the largest, with 191 hymns and 2,006 verses, and it {{was added}} to the text after Books 2 through 9.

50|$|EJ Dobson {{produced}} {{the most influential}} modern reassessment {{of the origins of}} the work, however. Dobson argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> anchoresses were enclosed near Limebrook in Herefordshire, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was an Augustinian canon at nearby Wigmore Abbey in Herefordshire named Brian of Lingen. Bella Millett has subsequently argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was in fact a Dominican rather than an Augustinian, though this remains controversial.|$|R
