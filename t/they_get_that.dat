60|$|If {{thou art}} a Christian, thou hast {{more than an}} {{ordinary}} call and occasion to abide by these waters; thy things will not grow but by these waters. Weeds and the excellencies of most men we may find in the barren wilderness, they grow under every hedge; but thine are garden, and so choice things, and will not thrive without much water, no, without the water of God's river. Dwell, therefore, here; that thy soul may be as a watered garden (Jer 31:12; Isa 12:1-3). And when thou seest how those that are loath to die,[19] make provision at Tunbridge, Epsom, the Bath, and other places, and what houses <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> they may have their dwellings by those waters, then do thou consider of thy spiritual disease, and how nothing can cure thee but this blessed water of life; be also much of desires to have a dwelling-place in Jerusalem, that thou mayest always be nigh to these waters. Be often also in watering thy plants with these waters. I mean the blessed graces of God in thy soul; then shalt thou grow, and retain thy greenness, and prove thyself to be a disciple indeed. And herein is God, and thy Father, glorified, that thou bear much fruit (John 15:8).|$|E
60|$|The truth is, that {{magazine}} {{stories and}} superstitious exaggerations have spoiled us for ghosts. When we hear of a haunted house, we {{imagine that the}} ghost is always on view, or {{that he has a}} benefit night, at certain fixed dates, when you know where to have him. These conceptions are erroneous, and a house may be haunted, though nothing desirable occurs in presence of the committee. Moreover the committee, as far as the writer is aware, have neglected to add a seer to their number. This mistake, if it has been made, is really wanton. It is acknowledged that not every one has 'a nose for a ghost,' as a character of George Eliot's says, or eyes or ears for a ghost. It is thought very likely that, where several people see an apparition simultaneously, the spiritual or psychical or imaginative 'impact' is addressed to one, and by him, or her (usually her) handed on {{to the rest of the}} society. Now, if the committee do not provide themselves with a good 'sensitive' comrade, what can they expect, but what <b>they</b> <b>get,</b> <b>that</b> is, nothing? A witch in an old Scotch trial says, of her 'Covin,' or 'Circle,' 'We could do no great thing without our Maiden'. The committee needs a Maiden, as a Covin needed one, and among the visionaries of the Psychical Society, there must be some young lady who should be on the House Committee. Yet one writer in the Society's Proceedings who has a very keen scent for an impostor, if not for a ghost, avers that, from the evidence, she believes that they are examining facts, and not the origin of fables.|$|E
60|$|Didn't {{look back}} when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyes she had, clear. It's {{the white of the}} eye brings that out not so much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his {{belongings}} on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>that?</b> Typist going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.|$|E

50|$|Players {{can choose}} to expand their empire on the {{continent}} map by trading with the rulers of other lands, or by fighting them in combat. When fighting, the player must choose his army (up to 8 troops) and then will play against an AI with predetermined troops in a turn-by-turn strategy game. Each troop has its own weaknesses, strengths, health and attack, and so proper strategy must be used to ensure a victory. If the player is victorious, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> sector, and are closer to getting the province, which is gained when the player controls all of its sectors.|$|E

Unbelievably it's worse than the original one!" [...] Fans of the show disliked the version of the theme tune introduced in 2013. Ben Pobjie from The Age also disliked that version, saying [...] "Barry Crocker must be scandalised. His beloved and iconic interpretation of the theme to Neighbours has been mauled beyond all recognition. I don't think it's even the same tune. I'm not sure it even is a tune any more." ...|$|E
50|$|In some jurisdictions, if {{the spouse}} claims the {{elective}} share, <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> amount, {{but nothing else}} from the estate. In other states, claiming an elective share {{has no effect on}} gifts under a will or through a trust (though things given by will or trust may fulfill in part the elective share portion). Obviously, there would be no point in seeking an elective share if the surviving spouse has already been willed more than they would receive under the statute. Furthermore, some assets held by the estate may be exempt from becoming part of the elective share, so their value is subtracted from the total value of the estate before the elective share is calculated.|$|E

50|$|The {{remaining}} 2 players go head-to-head {{to answer}} questions on a subject. When the subject is given, the players have to type in which level question (between 1 and 5) they would like. The player who chose the higher level gets to answer their question. If they get it right, they get the relevant number of points. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a question from that category at the level that they chose. If <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> right, they get the points. If both players go for the same level, the question is asked with both players on the buzzer. The first to reach 15 points goes to the final round (From 19 March 2009, this was dropped to 10 points). The other player has {{to wait until the}} next day until he/she can play again.|$|E
5000|$|Magic Number - Caller picks {{a letter}} of A,B,C,D each one has a number and the caller has to pick three hats from the board without going over the number they picked i.e. if they pick 20, of the three numbers they pick.

In the revived version, a spin of a wheel determines the [...] "magic number," [...] and the caller is shown three prizes of increasing value.
