Universities may also have a musicology department, and do research on many styles of music.|$|E
5|$|Towards the end {{of winter}} in August, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> changes in the {{atmospheric}} circulation. Warm, humid air penetrates the city, higher solar radiation and frequent synoptic weather disturbances from the west occur during {{the end of}} the winter. As such, the end of winter is usually characterized by heavy storms with lightning. This is popularly known as the Santa Rosa Storm, around August 30. Based on 111 years of weather observations (1906–2016) from the central observatory, 61 years (55% of the time) have seen stormy weather occurring on days close to August 30, although not all of these have led to heavy precipitation.|$|E
