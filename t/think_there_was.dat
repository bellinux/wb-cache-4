5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a single moment where either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E
25|$|At first I {{was only}} {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Radcliffe {{had already}} {{established}} himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents {{to allow him to}} audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed. (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.) Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a better choice for the part of Harry Potter.|$|E
25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The Chief Technical Adviser of Australian National Airways, Thomas Lawrence, {{told the}} inquiry {{he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any {{evidence}} to indicate the automatic pilot was engaged {{at the time of}} the accident.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did}} not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything to get excited about, either. Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 he {{initiated}} {{the creation of}} the science fiction television series Doctor Who. The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having [...] "created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme", and by The Times newspaper as [...] "quintessential to being British". Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: [...] "p to the age of 40, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a science-fiction book I hadn't read. I love them because they're a marvellous way—and a safe way, I might add—of saying nasty things about our own society." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cornell {{revealed}} {{further information}} about the band's breakup; [...] "Personally {{a lot of it}} was me trying to land on my feet again. I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|The Ibagué Red Cross {{contacted}} Armero's {{officials and}} ordered an evacuation, {{which was not}} carried out because of electrical problems caused by a storm. The storm's heavy rain and constant thunder may have overpowered {{the noise of the}} volcano, and with no systematic warning efforts, the residents of Armero were completely unaware of the continuing activity at Ruiz. At 9:45pm, after the volcano had erupted, Civil Defense officials from Ibagué and Murillo tried to warn Armero's officials, but could not make contact. Later they overheard conversations between individual officials of Armero and others; famously, a few heard the Mayor of Armero speaking on a ham radio, saying [...] "that he did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much danger", when he was overtaken by the lahar.|$|E
500|$|The Naval Academy and the University of Maryland are {{separated}} by about 30 miles {{in the state of}} Maryland. The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of a blue-collar, working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen [...] "thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners." [...] A former Navy fullback, Pat Donnelly, said that compared to a [...] "public institution, [...] was night and day. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a feeling of mutual dislike, but it wasn’t personal, it was more institutional." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Redgrave, {{vice-president}} of the BOA, added [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a sense of}} disappointmentI <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a sense of celebration of winning that gold medal. I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day." [...] Hunt also announced that the BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|R

500|$|Vane {{was widely}} {{recognized}} by contemporary chroniclers as a gifted administrator and a forceful orator. Even the royalist Clarendon had good words for him, and wrote {{of him as}} follows: [...] "He had an unusual aspect, which ... made men <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something in him of the extraordinary; and his whole life made good that imagination." [...] Also, Clarendon credited Vane with having possessed [...] "extraordinary parts, a pleasant wit, a great understanding, a temper not to be moved", and in debate [...] "a quick conception and a very sharp and weighty expression". [...] The 1662 biography The Life and Death of Sir Henry Vane the Younger by Vane's chaplain George Sikes included John Milton's [...] "Sonnet 17", written in 1652 in praise of Vane, and presented to Vane that year.|$|E
500|$|Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic noted, [...] "'Concentrate and Ask Again'" [...] {{did little}} to drive the {{overriding}} story forward, but it did a brilliant job of making me question everything." [...] Nonetheless, she commented that it [...] "... was nowhere near as intense as 'Reciprocity'." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anything [...] "particularly remarkable about the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some really interesting action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E
500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything {{you would want to}} see." ...|$|E

500|$|Historian Seth Jacobs {{asserted}} that Đức had [...] "reduced America's Diệm experiment to ashes as well" [...] and that [...] "no amount of pleading could retrieve Diệm's reputation" [...] once Browne's images had become ingrained into {{the psyche of}} the world public. Ellen Hammer described the event as having [...] "evoked dark images of persecution and horror corresponding to a profoundly Asian reality that passed the understanding of Westerners." [...] John Mecklin, an official from the U.S. embassy, noted that the photograph [...] "had a shock effect of incalculable value to the Buddhist cause, becoming {{a symbol of the}} state of things in Vietnam." [...] William Colby, then chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's Far East Division, opined that Diệm [...] "handled the Buddhist crisis fairly badly and allowed it to grow. But I really don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> much they could have done about it once that bonze burned himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{doctors who}} {{attended}} Louise reported she was severely concussed and in shock, and that [...] "it was a wonder her skull was not fractured". Louise's ear {{had been injured}} when her earring caught {{on the side of}} the sleigh, tearing her ear lobe in two. The press played down the story on instructions from Lorne's private secretary, an act that was described by contemporaries as [...] "stupid and ill advised". For example, one New Zealand newspaper reported, [...] "Excepting immediately after the blow, the Princess was perfectly sensible during the whole time..." [...] Knowledge of Louise's true condition might have elicited sympathy from the Canadian people. As it was, one Member of Parliament wrote: [...] "Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no injury done worth mentioning." [...] Therefore, when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements, people thought she was malingering. News of the accident was also played down in Britain, and in letters home to the anxious Queen Victoria.|$|E
500|$|GoldenEye 007 {{introduced}} stealth elements {{not seen}} in previous first-person shooter games. Doak explained how this was implemented: [...] "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within {{a certain amount of}} time, it did a larger radius test and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset". Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though decidedly unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to covertly spy on enemies. The game's multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis described it as [...] "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who [...] "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fisher and {{geographer}} Stephen Leisz, both of Colorado State University, {{presented their}} findings {{at the annual}} conference of the American Geophysical Union in May 2013. When asked if Ciudad Blanca had been found, Fisher laughed and said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a single Ciudad Blanca. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many." [...] The legend may hold cultural meaning, he said, but for archeologists it is mostly a distraction.|$|R
