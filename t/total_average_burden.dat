40|$|HLA-restricted immune escape {{mutations}} that persist following HIV transmission could gradually {{spread through}} the viral population, thereby compromising host antiviral immunity as the epidemic progresses. To assess the extent and phenotypic impact of this phenomenon in an immunogenetically diverse population, we genotypically and functionally compared linked HLA and HIV (Gag/Nef) sequences from 358 historic (1979 - 1989) and 382 modern (2000 - 2011) specimens from four key cities in the North American epidemic (New York, Boston, San Francisco, Vancouver). Inferred HIV phylogenies were star-like, with approximately two-fold greater mean pairwise distances in modern versus historic sequences. The reconstructed epidemic ancestral (founder) HIV sequence was essentially identical to the North American subtype B consensus. Consistent with gradual diversification of a "consensus-like" founder virus, the median "background" frequencies of individual HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV (in individuals lacking the restricting HLA[s]) were ∼ 2 -fold higher in modern versus historic HIV sequences, though these remained notably low overall (e. g. in Gag, medians were 3. 7 % in the 2000 s versus 2. 0 % in the 1980 s). HIV polymorphisms exhibiting the greatest relative spread were those restricted by protective HLAs. Despite these increases, when HIV sequences were analyzed as a whole, their <b>total</b> <b>average</b> <b>burden</b> of polymorphisms that were "pre-adapted" to the average host HLA profile was only ∼ 2 % greater in modern versus historic eras. Furthermore, HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in historic HIV sequences were consistent with those detectable today, with none identified that could explain the few HIV codons where the inferred epidemic ancestor differed from the modern consensus. Results are therefore consistent with slow HIV adaptation to HLA, but at a rate unlikely to yield imminent negative implications for cellular immunity, at least in North America. Intriguingly, temporal changes in protein activity of patient-derived Nef (though not Gag) sequences were observed, suggesting functional implications of population-level HIV evolution on certain viral proteins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify time spent plus out-of-pocket costs associated with confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization of infants not prophylaxed against RSV. MethodsA prospective survey was carried out at multiple tertiary care hospitals in the United States. PatientsThe patients consisted of a consecutive sample of infants < 12 months, born between 33 and 35 weeks of gestation. One site also enrolled full-term infants hospitalized with confirmed RSV. Daily patient census identified eligible patients. Consenting caregivers of eligible subjects (n= 84, 1 refusal) were interviewed on discharge day and by telephone ∼ 30 days following discharge regarding time and out-of-pocket costs due to RSV. ResultsTotal average out of pocket expenses were $ 643. 69 (range $ 21 –$ 16, 867; SD $ 2, 403) for premature and $ 214. 42 (range $ 6 –$ 827; SD $ 218) (P=. 0158) for full-term subjects. <b>Total</b> <b>average</b> economic <b>burden</b> per admission was $ 4517. 07 for premature and $ 2135. 30 for full-term infants, including the value of lost productivity but excluding inpatient hospital and physician bills and lost income. Premature infants (n= 48) had longer hospital stays (mean 6. 9 days; SD 7. 5 vs. 3. 4 days; SD 2. 6 days) (P=. 001) with an associated mean total time spent by up to 5 adults of 281. 7 hours (range 25 – 2819. 7 hours; SD 465. 8 hours) versus a mean of 139. 7 hours (range 31. 8 – 561. 3 hours; SD 118. 1 hours) for term infants (P=. 109). Time and out-of-pocket costs continued after discharge. ConclusionsRSV hospitalization of infants is associated with substantial, previously unmeasured time and monetary losses. These losses continued following discharge. The economic burden on families and society appears heavier for infants born at 33 to 35 weeks of gestation than for full-term infants...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the burden of caregivers of stroke patients and the factors affecting the burden. Methods: This descriptive research was conducted at Turkey İzmir Atatürk Education and Research Hospital, Clinic for Neurology with the participation of 80 caregivers who agreed {{to take part in the}} research between January 15 and March 15, 2007. Data were collected using an introductory information form and the Caregiver Burden Inventory. Results: The <b>average</b> Caregiver <b>Burden</b> Inventory subscales scores were time-addiction burden 15. 31 ± 4. 07, developmental burden 8. 19 ± 4. 46, physical burden 6. 88 ± 3. 93, social burden 5. 55 ± 4. 40, emotional burden 3. 44 ± 4. 25. The <b>average</b> <b>total</b> <b>burden</b> score was 39. 36 ± 13. 83. There was found relationship between the ages of caregivers and the time-addiction burden; the social security and emotional and total burden; the requesting state to receive caregiver training and emotional burden; and the encountered difficulties in coping strategies and the average score for the physical burden subscale (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: In accordance with the aforementioned results, it has been concluded that taking care of a family member in need is perceived as a task and responsibility in Turkish society. Parallel to this, caregivers are not aware of their burden throughout the process and have difficulty in expressing the hardships they experience.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a two-hop relay network {{consisting of a}} source, a destination and multiple relay nodes. For a given quality of service (QoS) requirement such as transmission rate between the source and the destination, relay nodes have an adaptive power control scheme to meet the QoS requirement. The adaptive power control scheme {{is assumed to be}} based on the channel condition between relay nodes and the destination. It is then an interesting problem to design an optimal relay network that minimizes <b>total</b> <b>average</b> energy consumption. By considering the details on the operations of the relay selection protocol considered in this paper, we first develop a mathematical model for the relay network and analyze <b>total</b> <b>average</b> energy consumption.

As shown in Figure  10, SDBG recorded a minimum of 22 % and a maximum of 31 % better latency results than the worst scheme, URBC throughout the simulation. The achievements of URCBC and RR are moderate among the four schemes, but URCBC superseded URBC to become the poorest performer in <b>total</b> <b>average</b> end-to-end delay {{at the point of}} 60 to 80 s with tiny variance, around 0.3 % on average.

In contrast, SDBG is proving good results in both throughput and delay in all the simulation time.
