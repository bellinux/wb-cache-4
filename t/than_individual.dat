40|$|Previous {{research}} has discovered a curious phenomenon: groups cooperate less <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> in a deterministic prisoner’s dilemma game, but cooperate more <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> when uncertainty is {{introduced into the}} game. We conducted two studies to examine three possible processes that might drive groups to be more cooperative <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> in reducing risks: group risk concern, group cooperation expectation, and pressure to conform to social norms. We found that ex post guilt aversion and ex-post blame avoidance cause group members to be more risk concerned <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> under uncertainty. These concerns drive groups to choose the cooperation (and risk-reduction) strategy more frequently <b>than</b> <b>individuals.</b> Groups also have higher cooperation expectations for their corresponding groups <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> have for their corresponding individuals.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that groups {{tend to be less}} {{cooperative}} in prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s dilemma games compared to individuals. One hypothesis to explain this effect stems from groups 2 ̆ 7 natural tendencies to protect themselves from harm and enhance their relative standing. However, an alternative hypothesis is that groups are more rational in game situations. The current study attempted to distinguish between these two hypotheses by testing whether groups score higher <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> on measures of competitiveness and pro-self (group) behavior, and lower <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> on measures of prosocial behavior. The study also attempted to assess whether the pro-self tendencies of groups lead them to behave less ethically <b>than</b> <b>individuals.</b> I tested these hypotheses by using decomposed games and ethical dilemma problems. The results showed that groups were less prosocial <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> and less likely <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> to make the ethical choice in one of the two ethical dilemmas.

5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from}} being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather <b>than</b> <b>individual</b> players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along {{with the need for}} the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, so as to avoid clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill <b>than</b> <b>individual</b> isolated bacteria.|$|E

In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather <b>than</b> <b>individual</b> performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes are {{presently}} {{the most abundant}} livestock predators in western North America, causing the majority of sheep, goat, and cattle losses. For example, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, coyotes were responsible for 60.5% of the 224,000 sheep deaths attributed to predation in 2004. The total number of sheep deaths in 2004 comprised 2.22% of the total sheep and lamb population in the United States, which, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service USDA report, totaled 4.66 million and 7.80 million heads respectively as of July 1, 2005. Because coyote populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves, coyotes cause more overall predation losses. The United States government agents routinely shoot, poison, trap, and kill about 90,000 coyotes each year to protect livestock. An Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were 5% as likely to attack livestock <b>than</b> <b>individual</b> wolves.|$|E

The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather <b>than</b> <b>individual</b> animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E

There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the middle distance in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression.

5|$|The {{libretto}} of H.M.S. Pinafore {{relied on}} stock character types, {{many of which}} were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the German Reeds): the heroic protagonist (tenor) and his love-interest (soprano); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue (contralto); the baffled lyric baritone—the girl's father; and a classic villain (bass-baritone). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S. Pinafore, the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather <b>than</b> <b>individual</b> stars.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We examine bidding {{behavior}} {{of individuals and}} teams in an experimental auction which resembles UMTS-license auctions. Even though in reality teams – rather <b>than</b> <b>individuals</b> – were the bidding agents, experimental studies on bidding in auctions have so far relied on individual bidders. Our results show that teams stay on average longer in an (ascending sealed-bid English) auction and pay significantly higher prices <b>than</b> <b>individuals.</b> Consequently, teams make smaller profits and suffer more often from the winner’s curse. The auction’s efficiency is nevertheless higher with teams, since the bidders with the highest valuation {{are more likely to}} win the auction when teams bid rather <b>than</b> <b>individuals...</b>|$|R

At the same time, large patterns are more effective from afar, while small scale patterns work better up close. Traditional single scale patterns work well in their optimal range from the observer, but an observer at other distances will not see the pattern optimally. Nature itself is very often fractal, where plants and rock formations exhibit similar patterns across several magnitudes of scale. The idea behind multi-scale patterns is both to mimic the self-similarity of nature, and also to offer scale invariant or so-called fractal camouflage that works at close range {{as well as at}} traditional combat range.|$|E
