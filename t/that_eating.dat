5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Homer is watching the news on Halloween night while eating candy, which ends up being taken by Jimbo and Kearney after they threaten to egg his house. Marge and the kids return home after trick-or-treating with a big haul of candy. Despite warnings from Marge <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> the candy will cause nightmares, Homer, Lisa, and Bart eat from the large candy pile. That night, all three try to sleep, and Lisa is the first to have a nightmare.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|Consumers (heterotrophs) are {{species that}} cannot {{manufacture}} {{their own food}} and need to consume other organisms. Animals <b>that</b> <b>eat</b> primary producers (like plants) are called herbivores. Animals <b>that</b> <b>eat</b> other animals are called carnivores, and animals <b>that</b> <b>eat</b> both plant and other animals are called omnivores.|$|R

5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on instrument panels. Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E

25|$|She {{also worked}} {{on the effects of}} plant hormones on insects, showing that sexual {{maturity}} in desert locusts is regulated by gibberellins, so <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> withered vegetation low in gibberellins might prevent the insects becoming sexually mature during the dry season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} control method used is carbaryl (typically sold as [...] "Sevin Dust") bait. This bait kills both the Mormon crickets <b>that</b> <b>eat</b> the bait, and the crickets <b>that</b> <b>eat</b> crickets <b>that</b> <b>ate</b> the bait. Insecticides applied directly to crops may kill the insects, {{but due to}} the large size of swarms, this method usually does not save the crop from being destroyed.|$|R

25|$|Exocannibalism is the {{consumption}} of a person from outside the community, usually as a celebration of victory against a rival tribe. Both types of cannibalism can also be fueled by the belief <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> a person's flesh or internal organs will endow the cannibal {{with some of the}} characteristics of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the early Christians in the apostolic era (James, Peter and John) were {{concerned}} <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> food sacrificed to idols (and the only food sacrificed to idols was meat) might result in ritual pollution. The Apostle Paul emphatically rejected that view, which resulted in division of an Early Church (Romans 14:2-21; compare 1 Corinthians 8:8-9, Colossians 2:20-22).|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{from the}} Harvard School of Public Health found in 2010 <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> {{processed}} meats (such as bacon) that are preserved by smoking, curing or salting, {{or with the}} addition of chemical preservatives, was associated with an increased risk of both heart disease and diabetes. The same association was not found for unprocessed meat.|$|E
25|$|Eating {{disorders}} are less reported in preindustrial, non-westernized countries than in Western countries. In Africa, not including South Africa, the only data presenting information about eating disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies, not studies investigating prevalence.

Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination.|$|E
25|$|The Aghoris are Indian ascetics {{who believe}} <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> human flesh confers spiritual and {{physical}} benefits, such as prevention of aging. They claim to only eat {{those who have}} voluntarily willed their body to the sect upon their death, although an Indian TV crew witnessed one Aghori feasting on a corpse discovered floating in the Ganges, {{and a member of}} the Dom caste reports that Aghoris often take bodies from the cremation ghat (or funeral pyre).|$|E
25|$|The United States Olympic Committee {{imported}} {{food for}} American athletes, citing concerns regarding {{the safety of}} food products produced in China. In particular, athletes were concerned <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> meat that was raised in China could contain enough steroids to cause the athletes to test positive for steroid use. Several Canadian athletes received permission to do the same. The United States Olympic Committee's plan to bring its own food to China disappointed the leader of food services for the Beijing Olympics.|$|E

25|$|An individual's plan {{of eating}} may {{call for the}} {{exclusion}} of certain triggering behaviors. For example, a person who knows <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> after a certain time in the evening triggers compulsive food behavior might include in their plan of eating a commitment to abstain from eating after that time of night; a person who knows that snacking between meals triggers compulsive food behavior would probably include in their plan of eating a commitment to abstain from chewing (or sucking) between meals.|$|E
25|$|Hearing this cry, Guanyin quickly sent Shancai {{to recover}} the fish and gave him all the money she had. The fish at this point {{was about to be}} sold in the market. It was causing quite a stir as it was alive hours after being caught. This drew a much larger crowd than usual at the market. Many people decided that this prodigious {{situation}} meant <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> the fish would grant them immortality, and so all present wanted to buy the fish. Soon a bidding war started, and Shancai was easily outbid.|$|E
25|$|The {{flagship}} {{species of the}} sanctuary is the near threatened blackbuck antelope, {{one of the four}} antelope species in India (Chinkara, Chausingha and Nilgai being the other three) and the most numerous large animal in the sanctuary. The population estimate of the blackbuck at Point Calimere more than doubled in thirty years, from 750–800 in 1967 to 1,908 in 1998/99. This isolated population of blackbuck probably survived unmolested throughout the centuries due to the locals' now declining belief <b>that</b> <b>eating</b> its meat causes leprosy. The predators of the blackbuck at Point Calimere are jackals, and sometimes village dogs. Competition for food is from domestic and feral cattle.|$|E
