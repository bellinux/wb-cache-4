40|$|This paper studies a {{bargaining}} {{model in which}} the seller is uncertain about which distribution <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> values are drawn from. The distribution of <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> values is fixed across periods, while <b>the</b> <b>buyer’s</b> values are drawn independently from the distribution each period. In the classical model of repeated bargaining where <b>the</b> <b>buyer’s</b> value is drawn from a commonly known distribution and fixed across periods, <b>the</b> high-value <b>buyer</b> has a strong incentive to conceal his value, and the seller loses most of her bargaining power. An important question is whether adding a layer of uncertainty makes <b>the</b> high-value <b>buyer</b> more willing to accept high-price offers and improves the seller’s revenue. We find {{this to be the}} case as long as the seller’s ex ante beliefs are sufficiently optimistic. Repeated Bargaining, Uncertain Value Distributions, Revenue Comparison, Learning...|$|R
5|$|When the han {{feudal system}} was {{abolished}} in 1871, Himeji Castle {{was put up}} for auction.

5|$|Although modern {{scholars}} know of some surviving {{cases where}} Han law dealt with commerce and domestic affairs, the spheres of trade (outside the monopolies) {{and the family}} were still largely governed by age-old social customs. Many ways in which family relations were conducted during the Han were already stipulated in the ancient Confucian canon, especially in the Book of Rites. This became accepted as the mainstream guide to ethics and custom. In terms of private commercial contracts, they usually entailed information on the goods transferred, the amount paid, the names of <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> and seller, the date of transfer and the signatures of witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Hire-purchase {{agreements}} are also regulated by this Act. The provisions {{are very similar}} to those for sale of goods agreements, with the section on exclusion clauses identical. Under the 1893 Act, conditional sale agreements (where <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> takes possession of the goods, but the seller retains the right to repossess them) were treated as hire-purchase agreements, despite being fundamentally sales. With the unification of provisions for hire-purchase and sale of goods agreements, conditional sale {{agreements are}} now treated as sales.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{develops}} a model where service buyer loyalty {{can be achieved}} by seller education of <b>the</b> service <b>buyer.</b> Buyer education implies both offering services and development of <b>the</b> service <b>buyer's</b> capability to use <b>the</b> service. Service <b>buyer</b> education is facilitated by seller competence on the service offering and <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> context. <b>The</b> {{reason for this is that}} the more embedded the service seller is in <b>the</b> <b>buyer's</b> context, <b>the</b> better able are they to educate <b>the</b> service <b>buyer.</b> Antecedent to seller competence, at any given point of time, or level of relationship development, is <b>the</b> service <b>buyer's</b> current understanding of seller resources. The model is tested and confirmed on 255 small firms. The model identifies that education can align <b>the</b> service offering, <b>buyer</b> resources, and seller resources in buyer - seller relationships.

5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the castor beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling castor beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as <b>the</b> <b>buyer.</b> Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of castor beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E

5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, Blizzard {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The end-user license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard. Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} slaves varied in {{accordance}} with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 drachmas; while a workman at major works was paid one drachma per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 drachmas each. Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of Apollo at Actium. The Acarnanian League, which {{was in charge of the}} logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part. Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against latent defects; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and <b>the</b> <b>buyer</b> had not been warned about it.|$|E
5|$|The {{various forms}} of the Victoria Cross are {{inherently}} valuable, as was highlighted on 24 July 2006, when at the auctionhouse Bonhams in Sydney, the VC which had been awarded to First World War soldier Captain Alfred Shout, fetched a world-record hammer price of $1 million. Shout had been awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in 1915 for hand-to-hand combat at the Lone Pine trenches in Gallipoli, Turkey. <b>The</b> <b>buyer,</b> Kerry Stokes, has lent it to the Australian War Memorial for display with the eight other Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians at Gallipoli. The Australian War Memorial in Canberra currently holds 66 Victoria Crosses, 63 awarded to Australians—including Mark Donaldson's Victoria Cross for Australia on loan—and three to British soldiers; this formed the largest publicly displayed collection in the world, until {{the opening of the}} Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in London during November 2010, which displays the 168 VCs owned by Lord Ashcroft and 48 more held by the IWM.|$|E
