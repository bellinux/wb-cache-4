The present study first {{constructed}} an urban traffic network model which took time factor into consideration, namely, adding time factor into the traditional network model, so as to reflect the dynamic change of traffic network. Then, the author designed the algorithm of the model and gave a detailed description of its procedures. A simplified algorithm in choosing the optimum <b>travel</b> <b>way</b> was provided {{to meet the needs of}} different types of people (the optimistic type, the conservative type, and the medium type). Finally, taking the city of Zhengzhou as an example, the author validated the algorithm of the model, and compared it with the traditional algorithm.

40|$|Seventy {{per cent}} of the Earth?s surface is sea. Yet, until {{recently}} social and cultural geographers have failed to {{pay much attention to}} this aspect {{of the world in which}} we live, with the most notable contributions deriving from historical perspectives. This study examines the work characterising this area of research before outlining possible reasons for the failure of consistent and comprehensive examination of the seas and ships for social and cultural geographers who take a more contemporary focus. The sea has been typically understood as inferior to and marginal from the land and invisible in modern consciousness, yet it is nonetheless a vital space and one that is integral to the workings of the world as we currently know it. This study <b>travels</b> <b>through</b> the <b>ways</b> in which modern-day examinations of the maritime world are developing before outlining future promises that are surfacing for more contemporary social and cultural geographies of the sea. The study offers an overview of the relationship between social and cultural geography and the sea, contending by way of a conclusion for a greater volume of contemporary work considering maritime spaces to expand and deepen geographic understandings of the watery world.
