Stanley Hall {{was one of the first}} commentators to give {{only children}} a bad reputation when he referred to their situation as [...] "a disease in itself". Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as [...] "spoiled, selfish, and bratty". While many only children receive a lot of attention and resources for their development, it is not clear that as a class they are overindulged or differ significantly from children with siblings. Susan Newman, a social psychologist at Rutgers University and the author of Parenting an Only Child, says that this is a myth. [...] "People articulate that only children are spoiled, they're aggressive, they're bossy, they're lonely, they're maladjusted", she said. [...] "There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers." [...] However, differences have been found. Research involving <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> U.S. children's social and interpersonal skills has scored only children lower in self-control and interpersonal skills. While a later study failed to find evidence this continued through middle and high school, a further study showed that deficits persisted until at least the fifth grade.|$|E

Two composite measures of phonics and integrated language arts are constructed from teachers ’ reports of their instructional practices. Findings show that classroom mean outcomes were significantly higher when class-room teachers reported using both integrated language arts and phonics more often.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between internalizing and externalizing symptoms, gender, and the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Participants included 104 males and 74 females, aged 6 to 16 from a diagnostic clinic. Parents and teachers completed the Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale, Second Edition (ADDES- 2) {{to determine whether they}} met the criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) in order to measure internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Regression analyses indicated partial support for association between inattention and internalizing symptoms, with higher ratings of inattention found for both anxiety and depression as rated by parents and higher ratings of inattention for depression as rated by school. Although not predicted, a positive association was also found between home and school rated hyperactivity and depression. As hypothesized, higher ratings of hyperactivity in the home environment were predictive of all three externalizing behaviors as rated by parents, including measures of aggression, hyperactivity, and conduct problems, but only <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> hyperactivity. In addition, hyperactivity in the school environment was predictive of all <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> aggression, hyperactivity and conduct problems and only aggression as rated by parents. All parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> externalizing behaviors showed significantly higher scores for males. On measures of internalizing symptoms, no significant relationships were found with gender and parent and teacher ratings on inattention and hyperactivity, other than in the area of <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> somatization.

40|$|International audienceA {{handedness}} polymorphism {{exists in}} all human populations so far investigated, {{at least since}} the Palaeolithic. Handedness is a heritable trait, and a possible evolutionary explanation for the higher prevalence of right-handers is the association of left-handedness with some deleterious traits. In this context, the persistence of left-handers remains unexplained. Reproductive success {{has been shown to be}} dependent on cultural success in many human societies. This study is the first attempt to consider the importance of social status to evolutionary processes related to handedness. We conducted a survey in French public primary schools to look for a possible association between laterality, school performance, and leadership skills. This study revealed only weak associations, and a sex effect. For primary-school girls, we report a negative association between several indicators <b>of</b> left-sidedness and <b>teacher's</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> school performance and leadership skills. For primary-school boys, we report a positive association between left-handedness for writing and <b>teacher's</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> school performance.

While the literature suggests that prevention programs can be effective, rigorous independent research is lacking regarding the efficacy of many specific programs. The present study {{is based on a}} randomized-control experiment evaluating Second Step in 12 Maryland public elementary schools to assess the effects of the program on parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> student behavior. Ratings using the Social Competency Rating Form had previously been considered as a single global measure of student behavior, and had not been found to be affected by the intervention. Nonetheless, a re-consideration of the psychometric properties of the scale and its sensitivity to skills taught by the Second Step curriculum led to the speculation that separation of the global measure to reflect distinct ratings of social competency and problem behavior might reveal effects on the social competency component. Analyses show no effects on parent or <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> social competency or on <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> problem behavior.

The QTI itself is based on the Model of Interpersonal Behaviour which maps teacher behaviour in terms of Influence (Dominance–Submission) and Proximity (Cooperation–Opposition). In this study, an Indonesian version of the QTI was constructed and distributed to 2, 380 students of 69 teachers from 85 classes (grade 7 – 9) from 12 public lower secondary schools in Indonesia.

40|$|Shyness in {{childhood}} {{has been linked}} to multiple adjustment outcomes, including poor peer relations, internalizing problems, and clinical anxiety. However, shyness does not consistently emerge as a negative predictor of children’s success. This incongruity may stem, in part, from variations in the operationalization and measurement of shyness in different studies. Researchers often combine parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> shyness, but correlations between parent and teacher reports are consistently small to medium. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> shyness as they predict language and attention skills in preschool children, and explore discrepancies between parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> shyness. Participants were 104 preschool children (48 males, 56 females), enrolled in 22 classrooms. Results from multi-level modeling revealed that teacher, but not parent, ratings of shyness using the shyness subscale of the Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) were significantly and negatively associated with children’s early language and attention skills. Follow-up exploratory factor analyses with parent and teacher CBQ shyness subscale ratings revealed a similar two-factor structure reflecting shyness and low sociability. Results suggest that a) discrepancies between parents’ and teachers’ views of children’s shy behaviors may stem from the different contexts and developmental time periods in which they observe children, and b) teachers’ ratings of shyness are more closely associated with children’s skills in an academic setting.

40|$|This study {{involves}} {{an examination of}} the neurocognitive correlates of subscales of the Conners 2 ̆ 7 Rating Scale - Revised (CRS-R), an ADHD behavioral rating form, in both a child (n= 72) and an adolescent (n= 49) sample. While both behavioral rating forms and neuropsychological measures are commonly employed in pediatric clinical evaluations, these two forms of assessment do not generally converge as expected. The purpose of the current research was to examine and compare the abilities of intellectual, academic, attentional, and executive skills to account for variance in parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> behavior across two pediatric age groups in a clinical setting. Additionally, the study compared the relationships between behavioral ratings and cognition in children versus adolescents. The study found parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> cognitive problems and inattention to be better accounted for by general cognitive ability than by attention and executive skills in children. Conversely, ratings of child hyperactivity, as completed by both parents and teachers, were better explained by attention and executive skills. General cognitive and academic abilities best accounted for parent ratings of overall ADHD likelihood, whereas <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> ADHD likelihood were equally accounted for by general cognitive abilities and attentional and executive skills. Neither general cognitive and academic abilities nor attention and executive skills accounted for a significant proportion {{of the variance in the}} adolescent sample. Furthermore, results showed that the variance in parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> behavior was significantly accounted for by neurocognitive test performance across ratings subscales for child, but not adolescent clients. Overall, the results suggest that ADHD behavioral rating form accuracy varies according to subscale, informant, and age group. In child clients, ADHD behavioral ratings converged with theoretically associated cognitive abilities for subscales assessing hyperactive, but not inattentive behaviors. Both parent and teacher informants appear to take children 2 ̆ 7 s overall cognitive and academic abilities into consideration more so than attentional and executive skills when rating inattentive behaviors. This suggests either rating form or informant inaccuracy in identifying specific problems in attention and organization. Parents, in particular, appear to be relatively poorer raters of child behavior than teachers as only <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> overall ADHD likelihood were accounted for by attentional and executive skills. Parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> behavior appear to be of questionable accuracy across ADHD related behaviors in the assessment of adolescents. As behavioral ratings were not related to cognition in the 11 - 17 -year-old sample, ADHD behavioral rating forms appear to demonstrate poor convergent validity in adolescents. The finding that ratings of behavior were significantly related to cognition in children, but not in adolescents, suggests the presence of age-dependent differences in the presentation of ADHD symptoms or the accuracy of assessment tools between children and adolescents. Clinicians are encouraged to use caution when interpreting ratings of adolescent ADHD behavior and ratings of child inattentive behavior, as these scales may often not assess their purported constructs...|$|E

This investigation is an evaluation of a school’s attempt to address the large number of incidents of bullying. Materials from the Bully Free Classroom (BFC) by Allan Beane (2009) served as the intervention curriculum for 21, fifth grade students and six teachers. A 14 -week (with the exception of school breaks), six lesson intervention was implemented with three groups of students: two groups identified as perpetrators and one group of victims. Teachers received training on bullying knowledge and how to appropriately report bullying-related incidents. Pre and post measures of bullying knowledge, frequency <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> bullying and prosocial behaviors observed, and discipline referrals for bullying served as the dependent measures for the student participants.

Forty-five schools in Greater Manchester, England, were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Allocation was balanced by proportions of children eligible for free school meals and speaking English as an additional language via minimization. Children (N= 4516) aged 7 – 9 years at baseline in the participating schools were the target cohort. During the two-year trial period, teachers of this cohort in schools allocated to the intervention group delivered the PATHS curriculum, while their counterparts in the control group continued their usual provision. Teachers in PATHS schools received initial training and on-going support and assistance from trained coaches. Hierarchical linear modeling of outcome data was undertaken to identify both primary (e. g., for all children) and secondary (e. g., for children classified as “at-risk”) intervention effects. A primary effect of the PATHS curriculum was found, demonstrating increases in <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> changes in children's social–emotional competence. Additionally, secondary effects of PATHS were identified, showing reductions in <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> emotional symptoms and increases in pro-social behavior and child ratings of engagement among children identified as at-risk at baseline. However, our analyses also identified primary effects favoring the usual provision group, showing reductions in <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> peer problems and emotional symptoms, and secondary effects demonstrating reductions in <b>teacher</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> conduct problems and child ratings of co-operation among at-risk children.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the {{association}} between gender role, in terms of self-attribution of masculine and feminine characteristics, and children’s involvement in bullying problems during the elementaryschool years. A total of 113, six- to ten-year-old children completed self-reportmeasures of bullying and victimization and a masculinity–femininity scale.

This was a longitudinal study of a sample of culturally disadvantaged children and their matched controls intended to highlight the effects of cultural and material disadvantage in the home upon children's school progress and adjustment. Main Topics : Variables The children were originally studied at the infant school stage (7 + years) and were followed up at the ages of 11 + and 15 + years respectively, i. e. at the late junior school and secondary school stages.

In addition background information about their schools and home backgrounds was also obtained. Data from the children were obtained {{through a combination of}} tests, questionnaires and personal interviews carried out in school. <b>Teacher's</b> <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> the children's progress and school adjustment and basic descriptive information about the children's schools were obtained by questionnaires completed by teachers.

The data were statistically analysed for between-group differences (control versus disadvantaged group) and comparable test data obtained on each of the three occassions of study were examined for trend...|$|R
