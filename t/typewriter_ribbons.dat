25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed {{and took out a}} couple of patents for re-inking <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbons,</b> but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|E

50|$|Single-strike and Multi-strike ribbons were {{an attempt}} to address issues in the ribbon's ink quality. Standard printer ribbons used the same {{principles}} as <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbons.</b> The printer would be at its darkest with a newly installed ribbon cartridge, but would gradually grow fainter with each successive printout. The variation in darkness over the ribbon cartridge's lifetime prompted the introduction of alternative ribbon formulations. Single-strike ribbons used a carbon-like substance in <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbons</b> transfer. As the ribbon was only usable for a single loop (rated in terms of 'character count'), the blackness was of consistent, outstanding darkness. Multi-strike nylon ribbons gave an increase in ribbon life, {{at the expense of}} quality.|$|E

It was {{originally}} contrasted with both daisy wheel printers and line printers that used fixed-shape embossed metal or plastic stamps to mark paper.|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe RIVM {{study to}} {{establish}} criteria for small quantities of hazardous household waste {{pointed out that}} in many cases {{little is known about the}} chemical composition of products often used in households. For this reason a number of products like audio- and videotapes, lipsticks, nail varnish, shoe polish, furniture polish, <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon</b> and photocopier drying toners were analysed. The investigation was carried out in cooperation with the IRI for inorganic analyses (instrumental neutron activation method) and TAUW for organic analyses (gas chromatography- mass spectrometry method). Especially audio-and videotapes contain sometimes high concentrations of metals like Cr IV, Ni, Zn, Co and Sb. Some tapes contain also high Cl concentrations due to probably PVC. Results showed that, compared to the criteria waste materials from the investigated products should not be indicated as hazardous household waste, except shoe polish, furniture polish and similar products (naphtalene content) and <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon</b> (oil content). Further investigation is necessary to confirm this...|$|R
25|$|In 1941, IBM {{announced}} the Electromatic Model 04 electric typewriter, featuring the revolutionary concept of proportional spacing. By assigning varied rather than uniform spacing to different sized characters, the Type 4 recreated {{the appearance of}} a printed page, an effect that was further enhanced by a <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon</b> innovation that produced clearer, sharper words on the page. The proportional spacing feature became a staple of the IBM Executive series typewriters.|$|R

5000|$|In {{present day}} Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old {{typewriter}} as {{a birthday present}} by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the <b>typewriter's</b> <b>ribbon.</b> As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zones—areas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead.|$|R
5000|$|Stefano {{investigates the}} message {{left on the}} <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon.</b> He {{encounters}} people who {{make it clear that}} they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences. A nearby service station attendant tells Stefano that French investors are building a gigantic hotel on the property, but no work is ever seen being done.|$|R

5000|$|JOSS {{was dubbed}} [...] "The Helpful Assistant" [...] for its {{conversational}} user interface. Originally green/black <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbons</b> {{were used in}} its terminals with green being used for user input and black for the computer's response. Mathematically, JOSS was interesting because it stored all numbers as an integer and a decimal exponent. This means calculations were exact decimal values, as opposed to floating point calculations. One third plus one third plus one third was exactly one. Any command that was not understood elicited the response [...] "Eh?" [...] or [...] "SORRY".|$|E

50|$|As of 1932 the {{typewriter}} became increasingly popular in offices, and the mimeograph became all the rage. Talens started to supply carbon paper, <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon,</b> stencils and stencil ink. The brand Gluton, the glue {{in the famous}} pot-and-brush, became a household name. During World War II there was a shortage of raw materials, and the factory sustained {{a great deal of}} damage by a stray bomb. After the country’s liberation the factory started operations once more. In 1949 Talens received the designation ‘Royal’ and changed its name to Koninklijke Fabrieken Talens & Zoon (Royal Works Talens & Son). The subsequent years were characterized by enormous growth for the company, and branches were set up in more than 50 countries.|$|R

5000|$|The {{methods of}} the U.B. {{involved}} one-to-one correspondence, with an elaborate set of rules regarding strict secrecy of instructions, envelopes-within-envelopes, purple <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbons,</b> and special paperclips. Aspirants were provided with typescript lectures ("sutras") on metaphysical topics, using idiosyncratic terms like [...] "integrality" [...] and [...] "partitivity." [...] A system of alms provided for funds to be remitted back up the same chain down which these instructions descended. Organizational titles and pseudonyms in the U.B. were generally taken from Sanskrit. Few U.B. writings have become accessible to non-members, but those that have, taken with Jones' writings in the U.B. vein, suggest that their doctrines involved a baroquely intellectualized form of sentimental monotheism.|$|E
50|$|Woven <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbons</b> {{were the}} earlier variant. With them, the pigment is an ink that dries on typing paper {{but not on}} the ribbon, and the ribbon is mounted at each end to a flanged reel whose hub engages with one of the axles. Only the axle onto which the ribbon is winding is driven, and the ribbon module is {{intended}} to work with an axle-driving mechanism that reverses the direction of rotation when the undriven axle reaches the point where there is no ribbon left wound around it. Thus the full length of the ribbon shuttles back and forth between reels, and each position along it is struck twice in each cycle of the ribbon's motion (once in the right-to-left phase and once in the left-to-right).|$|E

50|$|The Biel-Les Convers railway {{opened in}} 1874 and {{encouraged}} industrial and population growth. The lime and cement factory in Rondchâtel (1874), the wood pulp plant at Biberist (1882) and {{a branch of}} the Rondchâtel cement factory in La Reuchenette (today Ciments Vigier SA) all contributed to the prosperity of the municipality. The watch manufacturer Dreyfus Frères SA of Biel opened a branch company in 1903 in Péry. This company, called Péry Watch, did not survive the financial crisis of the 1930s. The building was converted in 1934 into a <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon,</b> stencils and carbon paper factory under the name Carfa SA. Carfa remained in operation until 2003. In 2005, just over half of all jobs in the municipality were in manufacturing.|$|R
50|$|The special aniline dyes {{for making}} the master image {{came in the form}} of ink or in pens, pencils, carbon paper and even <b>typewriter</b> <b>ribbon.</b> Hectograph pencils and pens are {{sometimes}} still available. Various other inks have been found usable to varying degrees in the process; master sheets for spirit duplicators have also been pressed into service. Unlike a spirit duplicator master, a hectograph master is not a mirror image. Thus, when using a spirit duplicator master with a hectograph, one writes on the back of the purple sheet, using it like carbon paper to produce an image on the white sheet, rather than writing on the front of the white sheet to produce a mirror image on its back.|$|R
