5|$|The {{depositions}} that Hutchinson {{collected and}} sent to London were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston. Drawn mainly from depositions by soldiers, its account of affairs sought to blame selfish Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's hoodlums and gangs for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers. However, as it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it ended up having a much smaller impact on <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>debate</b> there.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive ascent of animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the ascent of animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>debate</b> over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} view on {{the origins}} of the Indo-Aryans is the Indo-Aryan migration theory, which states that they entered north-western India at about 1500 BCE.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{some of the}} ways in which {{different}} approaches to the idea of progress emerge alongside competing temporalities of sexual and gender diversity and belonging in <b>the</b> context of <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> and discussions on the Safe Schools Coalition review (February 2016). <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> provided an important point-of-focus for understanding the contemporary setting of support for minorities in relation to cultural belonging and inclusivity in educational settings. The paper discusses the relationship between progress and temporality in its historical setting within Australian LGBTQ political history. We investigate three angles in which progress has been articulated in the Safe Schools debates: (1) disruptions to support as political setback to progress; (2) the view that safe support is necessary for the progress of LGBTQ ‘vulnerable’ youth within ‘developmental stages’; (c) the framing by conservative commentators that LGBTQ support curricula is a form of ‘progressive politics’ that undoes normative histories of neoliberal and conservative progress. Making use of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>debates</b> around <b>the</b> Safe Schools curriculum to critique {{some of the ways}} in which progress on minority belonging for younger persons helps open the fields of meaning for alternative kinds of belonging that are produced through alternative cultural histories of marginalized subjects...|$|R

25|$|One {{of several}} {{reasons that the}} EPA Administrator {{declined}} to regulate carbon dioxide is uncertainty about whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming.

25|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty imposed {{reciprocity}} {{inside the}} European Union concerning voting rights in local elections; this already existed for the European elections. In several European states, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>debate</b> {{on the right}} of foreigners to vote was therefore renewed, as some foreign residents had the right to vote (European foreign residents) while others, non-Europeans, did not. As a result of this debate, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Slovenia and Belgium extended the right to vote, in different manners, to all foreign residents (which was already the case in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Netherlands).|$|E
