5|$|Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good {{went to work}} {{repairing}} the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed {{with the intention of}} servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. <b>The</b> <b>handrail</b> had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove <b>the</b> <b>handrail,</b> so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape <b>the</b> <b>handrail</b> with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, {{to be aware of the}} reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on <b>the</b> <b>handrail</b> after removal.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>handrail</b> was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} {{attaching}} the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a method for}} people counting in public transportation. In this particular scenario, various body poses corresponding to holding handrails must be accounted for. Kinect sensor mounted vertically has been employed to acquire a database of images of 1 - 5 persons, with and without body poses of holding a handrail. An algorithm has been devised for robust people counting, consisting of multiple steps. <b>The</b> <b>handrails</b> are removed by substituting an average image of <b>the</b> <b>handrails</b> from <b>the</b> image with persons holding a <b>handrail.</b> <b>The</b> image is then processed in blocks {{in order to find}} potential local maxima, which are subsequently verified to find head candidates. Finally, non-head objects are filtered out, based on the ratio of pixels with similar and near-zero value, in the neighbourhood of the maxima. The method has an average accuracy of 91 % and has proved to handle well <b>the</b> <b>handrails</b> in <b>the</b> depth maps. Key words: people counting, Kinect, public transportatio...|$|R

The old dining room to the right of this features a coffered ceiling dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including guilloché, acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned coffered ceiling with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with bay leaf design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of <b>the</b> <b>handrail.</b> [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896. A strongroom with [...] walls and heavy steel fire-proof doors was added in 1914, for the Dynevors to keep their important documents and valuables.

40|$|Usually, {{concrete}} bridges {{contain a}} ‘thick’ bridge deck. For various reasons, bridges are constructed with railings. This thesis discusses the stability problem of concrete bridges, which {{are designed with}} integrated railings into the carrying construction. The most important advantage, using load bearing railings, is a thinner bridge deck. This {{was also one of}} the requests of Public Works Rotterdam. The load bearing railings have to endure buckling. This phenomena is not very common in massive concrete bridges. Since the request for to alternative bridges with a thinner bridge deck, like this one, is becoming larger and larger, there is need for a simple rule of thumb. This indication is necessary for estimating the dimensions of this kind of bridge without a complicated calculation. For this thesis, the stability of a concrete pedestrian bridge with load bearing railings, has been checked in three ways. There has been focussed at the compression zone of <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>handrails.</b> 1. First <b>the</b> buckling force is calculated. Using the buckling force and the actual normal force in <b>the</b> <b>handrails,</b> it is possible to calculate the second order effects. 2. The total resisting moment in <b>the</b> <b>handrails</b> must be large enough to withstand the external first and second order moments. The resisting moment is based on uncracked concrete, therefore no tension stresses in <b>the</b> <b>handrails</b> are aloud. 3. If stability isn’t the problem, strength is. Hence the external normal force in <b>the</b> <b>handrails</b> most be lower than the normal force resisted. The problem has been analysed. The three checking’s are visualized in graphs over various dimensions. These graphs were used as a starting point of a parameter study to get a rule of thumb, which can be used for concrete pedestrian bridges with load bearing railings. There is also concluded that bridges with load bearing railings are more sensitive to local forces (on bridge deck and railings), than plate bridges are. The rule of thumb is applicable for bridges larger than 14 meter and smaller than 23 meter, depending on the applied concrete strength. Using this indications gives a correct estimation of the dimensions of a concrete pedestrian bridge with load bearing railings. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
