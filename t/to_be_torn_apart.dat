5|$|In San Francisco, a {{group of}} young men drive to an {{abandoned}} factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart.</b> The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.|$|E

25|$|While {{the game}} is not a perfect {{simulation}} of reality, it has been praised for its accurate orbital mechanics; all objects in the game except the celestial bodies are simulated using Newtonian dynamics. For instance, rocket thrust is applied to a vehicle's frame based on the placement of force-generating elements, and joints between parts have limited strength, allowing vehicles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by excessive or misdirected forces.|$|E
5000|$|Holidays (mysteries) {{dedicated}} to Dionysus in Greece were called Dionysii; in Rome they {{were known as}} Bacchanalia and in Thrace as Rozalii. Orphic mysteries held in honor of Dionysus-Zagreus were performed only by devoted unmarried men. They were called a-bii, which means [...] "not alive" [...] {{because they did not}} lead an ordinary life. The mysteries were held in secret places far from the eyes of the ordinary people and were accompanied by choral songs and mimic games. The culmination of the mysteries was the symbolic death of the king-priest, identified with Zagreus who according <b>to</b> myth <b>was</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by the Titans. Following the [...] "death", the mother goddess was also symbolically born. The first part was carried out through a sacrifice of a bull, horse, goat or even people and the latter through a sexual orgy. Later on, Orphic mysteries became a part of the Bacchanalia.|$|R

40|$|The {{geodesic}} deviation equation, {{describing the}} relative accelerations of nearby particles, and the Raychaudhury equation, giving {{the evolution of}} the kinematical quantities associated with deformations (expansion, shear and rotation) are considered in the framework of modified theories of gravity with an arbitrary curvature-matter coupling, by taking into account the effects of the extra force. As a physical application of the geodesic deviation equation the modifications of the tidal forces due to the supplementary curvature-matter coupling are obtained in the weak field approximation. The tidal motion of test particles is directly influenced not only by the gradient of the extra force, which is basically determined by the gradient of the Ricci scalar, but also by an explicit coupling between the velocity and the Riemann curvature tensor. As a specific example, the expression of the Roche limit (the orbital distance at which a satellite will begin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tidally <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by the body it is orbiting) is also obtained for this class of models.

In March, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople (including the Ginoux family) who described him as [...] "le fou roux" [...] (the redheaded madman); Van Gogh returned to hospital. Paul Signac visited him twice in March; in April Van Gogh moved into rooms owned by Dr Rey after floods damaged paintings in his own home. Two months later, he left Arles and voluntarily entered an asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence.

2500|$|Patriation {{was given}} a new impetus after the 1980 {{referendum}} on Quebec independence, before which Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement if the majority of Quebecers voted [...] "No". After a number of days of negotiation and the leak of the Kirby Memo which antagonized Quebec, by an [...] "internal federal source", after provincial premiers consulted at the Chateau Laurier, drafted a list of 10 powers to be devolved to the provinces in exchange for consent to patriation. Trudeau, when presented with the document, refused to accept it and reiterated his threat that he would seek the House of Commons' approval to proceed with a unilateral amendment. Faced with Premier of Manitoba Sterling Lyon's charge that it would [...] "tear the country apart", Trudeau responded that, if Canada could not have control of its own constitution and a charter when most provinces had their own, the country would deserve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1642 <b>to</b> 1651, England <b>was</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by {{a series}} of {{internal}} conflicts known as the English Civil War between the Charles I of England (and later Charles II of England) and those who supported Parliament. The nature of the engagement was primarily based on whether the monarchy wielded absolute power over its subjects or was a constitutional monarchy and had to rule alongside a legislative body (e.g. English Parliament). As the war became more protracted, hostilities eventually spread {{to other parts of the}} British Isles (notably Scotland and Ireland) yet the Channel Islands were gradually embroiled in the conflict as well. While there was some support for Parliament amongst the island's inhabitants, Jersey under the de Carterets (see Sir George Carteret and Sir Philippe de Carteret II) <b>were</b> able <b>to</b> secure the island for the King throughout much of the civil war period. Guernsey, on the other hand, sided with the Parliamentarian cause, though Castle Cornet was held by Royalist sympathiser, governor Sir Peter Osborne, until 1651.|$|R

50|$|In June 1994, {{the wreck}} of Derbyshire was found {{at a depth of}} 4 km, spread over 1.3 km. An {{additional}} expedition spent over 40 days photographing and examining the debris field looking for evidence of what sank the ship. Ultimately it was determined that waves crashing over the front of the ship had sheared off the covers of small ventilation pipes near the bow. Over the next 30+ hours, seawater had entered through the exposed pipes into the forward section of the ship, causing the bow to slowly ride lower and lower in the water. Eventually, the bow <b>was</b> completely exposed <b>to</b> the full force of the rough waves which caused the massive hatch on the first cargo hold to buckle inward allowing hundreds of tons of water to enter in moments. As the ship started to sink, the second, then third hatches also failed, dragging the ship underwater. As the ship sank, the water pressure caused the ship <b>to</b> <b>be</b> twisted and <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by implosion.|$|R
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind.

They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too.

2500|$|Meigle 2 stands nearly [...] high. It has a {{cross on}} one side and depicts Daniel in the lions' den on the other. The form of the head of the cross is {{possibly}} based on that of a jewelled metal cross and is unique. The projecting boss at the centre of the cross has eight smaller bosses around it that probably symbolise the eight days of Passion Week running from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday inclusive. The shaft of the cross contains three pairs of sculpted animals facing each other, with interlaced tails and tongues, while other beasts fill the space between the cross and the outer border of the monument. The monument is the work of a master sculptor with the figures being cut in deep relief and arranged in an orderly fashion. Meigle 2 has projecting tenons on its top and sides and was probably intended to slot into a screen or wall. Local folklore holds that the representation of Daniel in the lions' den depicts King Arthur's wife Guinevere, known locally as Vanora. She was abducted by King Mordred and condemned by Arthur <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by wild beasts. The monument was said to mark her grave. Meigle 2 was originally located {{on the east side of}} the northern entrance to the churchyard, opposite Meigle 1, and in front of a mound identified in local folklore as Vanora's Grave. Apart from the scene representing Daniel (or Vanora), the back of the monument also contains various other sections. These include a mounted huntsman with two hounds at the top, with an angel hovering above the dogs. Below this there is a procession of four horsemen, with three leading the fourth, who is distinguished by a large saddlecloth. The next row down is the Biblical Daniel scene, below this is a centaur holding an axe in each hand and branches trailing behind him. The lowest section depicts a beast grasping an ox, a club-wielding human figure is positioned behind the aggressor. The stone has lost some detail due to erosion, although this is concentrated at the lower part of the cross itself and suggests that some form of human activity regularly caused abrasion of that portion - the opposite side being less worn.|$|E

40|$|Only a few {{authors have}} been as {{influential}} as JÃ¶rn RÃ¼sen as regards the ongoing debate on history of historiography and, above all, theory of history in the Brazilian academic scene.

Her companions had passed beyond the idea of separation; {{it was as if}} they now cherished a secret satisfaction at the high dignity of their parting. Belinda in some way perceived they had become different. They were no longer tremulous lovers; they seemed sure of one another and with a new pride in their bearing. It would have pleased Belinda better, seeing how soon they were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart,</b> if they had not made quite such excellent breakfasts. She even suspected them of having slept well. Yet yesterday they had been deeply stirred. They had stayed out late last night, so late that she had not heard them come in. Perhaps then they had passed the climax of their emotions. Sir Richmond, she learnt, was to take the party to Exeter, where there would be a train for Falmouth a little after two. If they started from Bath about nine that would give them an ample margin of time in which to deal with a puncture or any such misadventure.|$|E

The moment the girl was delivered from her irons, she flung herself, all tears and frantic sobbings, into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she was whipped. He strained her to his breast, and smothered her face and the child's with kisses, and washed them with the rain of his tears. I suspected. I inquired. Yes, I was right; it was husband and wife. They had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>torn</b> <b>apart</b> by force; the girl had to be dragged away, and she struggled and fought and shrieked like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight; and even after that, we could still make out the fading plaint of those receding shrieks. And the husband and father, with his wife and child gone, never to be seen by him again in life?--well, the look of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned away; but I knew I should never get his picture out of my mind again, and there it is to this day, to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it.|$|E
