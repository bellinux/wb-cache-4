5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> monitoring service, which had called when <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> initially went off to confirm {{that there was a}} fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. <b>The</b> <b>alarm</b> calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members will not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call, with nearby community members repeating <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E

5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise <b>the</b> <b>alarm,</b> pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> he collapsed.|$|E

40|$|We tested <b>the</b> melodic <b>alarms</b> and {{mnemonics}} {{proposed in}} the international standard for alarms used in medical electrical equipment (IEC 60601 - 1 - 8) for learnability and discriminability, with 14 registered nurses over two days, approximately a week apart. Two learning modes (Mnemonics and No Mnemonics) were examined in computer administered tests. The first experimental group was supplied with mnemonics while the second group was not supplied with a strategy. On Day 1, participants were introduced to <b>the</b> <b>alarms.</b> On Day 2, participants were tested and then allowed to relearn <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> {{in a similar way}} to Day 1. The mean accuracy across all <b>alarms</b> other than <b>the</b> General <b>alarm</b> was poor (44 % correct). Only one participant reached the learning criterion by the end of Day 2. Furthermore, participants with formal musical training identified <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> with greater accuracy than those without (p= 0. 004). Our findings indicate that the identified problems need to be addressed before these alarms are introduced in practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{audibility}} and {{the identification}} of 23 auditory <b>alarms</b> in <b>the</b> intensive care unit (ICU) and 26 auditory <b>alarms</b> in <b>the</b> operating rooms (ORs) of a 214 -bed Canadian teaching hospital were investigated. Digital tape recordings of <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> were made and analyzed using masked-threshold software. The digital recordings were also presented to the hospital personnel responsible for monitoring these alarms {{on an individual basis}} in order to determine how many of <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> {{they would be able to}} identify when they heard them. Several of <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> in both areas of the hospital could mask other <b>alarms</b> in <b>the</b> same area, and many of <b>the</b> <b>alarms</b> in <b>the</b> operating rooms could be masked by the sound of a surgical saw or a surgical drill. The staff in the OR (anesthetists, anesthesia residents, and OR technologists) were able to identify a mean of between 10 and 15 of <b>the</b> 26 <b>alarms</b> found in their operating theatres. The ICU nurses were able to identify a mean of between 9 and 14 of <b>the</b> 23 <b>alarms</b> found in their ICU. Alarm importance was positively correlated with <b>the</b> frequency of <b>alarm</b> identification in <b>the</b> case of the OR, but was not significantly correlated in the case of the ICU.

5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off <b>the</b> <b>alarm.</b> A mysterious figure appears and stops <b>the</b> <b>alarm.</b> There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing <b>the</b> <b>alarm.</b> Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it.

30|$|This {{collaborative}} method {{creates a}} two-level <b>alarm</b> system: <b>the</b> node-level <b>alarm</b> and <b>the</b> network <b>alarm.</b> <b>The</b> node-level <b>alarm</b> is sent when an isolate node detects the maximum allowable number of <b>alarms.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>the</b> network <b>alarm</b> is transmitted when a configurable number of collaborative nodes sends a node-level <b>alarm</b> for <b>the</b> same attacker. The collaborative method improves the system because it eliminates the possible mistakes {{derived from the}} nodes’ location and, for instance, the variations in the received power {{and the number of}} packets.|$|R
