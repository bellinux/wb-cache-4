50|$|The village council {{unanimously}} {{approved a}} <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> with Cincinnati Public Schools {{in order to}} build a new school on half of Ficke Park. The move is opposed by nearby residents, especially in neighboring Sycamore Township who argue that they were not consulted or informed of <b>the</b> proposed <b>land</b> <b>swap.</b> <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> will likely be challenged on the premise that <b>the</b> <b>land</b> deed forbids <b>the</b> use of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> for anything other than a park or similar. On July 14, 2008, the Cincinnati Board of Education approved <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{proposed}} and final legislation designating the wilderness area included provisions for <b>land</b> <b>swaps</b> between {{private and public}} holders.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> {{meant that}} a number of {{improvements}} to the park could now go forward. The Montana FWP had long sought to build an interpretive center at the site, but due to the small amount of <b>land</b> <b>the</b> state owned the project had never received permission. Although <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> was not yet a done deal, in 1997 the Montana state legislature approved $950,000 for a new visitor center. The center was originally proposed for the top of the cliffs, but Native American tribes opposed that site. Instead, a [...] center was sited {{at the base of the}} hill leading up to the cliffs.|$|R

50|$|In December 2014, the United States Congress passed, and President Obama {{signed the}} 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which {{included}} {{the provisions of the}} stalled Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and Conservation Act. The Act cleared the way for <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> in which Resolution would receive 2,422 acres of National Forest land in exchange for deeding to the federal government 5,344 acres of private <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> mine would destroy an area set aside in 1955 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower which is sacred to the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Both the Oak Flat Campground, an area dotted with petroglyphs and historic and prehistoric sites, and the steep cliffs at Apache Leap would be affected.In July 2015, a march protesting <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> arrived in Washington DC.|$|R

5000|$|Opponents of {{the bill}} give several reasons for their opposition. One {{objection}} is that the bill forces the exchange to proceed too quickly, since it waives some requirements for analysis {{of the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> and mine. [...] Another objection to the bill is that the mining company has failed to indicate where it would get all of the water it needs to run the mine, since the mine is expected to require 40,000 acre-feet of water each year, roughly the amount used by the city of Tempe (with 160,000 people). [...] Another objection is that the two mining companies that own resolution Copper are foreign businesses. [...] Finally, opponents objected to the lack of consultation with Native Americans tribes about <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The AWC {{asked for}} {{proposals}} that included [...] "cultural space" [...] (such as a museum, musical performance space, or theatre), a hotel, office space, parking, residential housing, and retail space. Seventeen companies responded with proposals. Five were chosen in June 2006 by the AWC to submit more detailed proposals, and two selected to submit final proposals two months later. PN Hoffman/Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse was chosen in September 2006 {{to be the}} lead developer. But the development proposals were stalled because, two years after AWC and NRCR agreed to <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap,</b> <b>the</b> transaction had still not been formalized. The D.C. City Council attempted to pass legislation in November 2006 to force <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> through, and <b>the</b> AWC offered to buy out leaseholders for $20 million to encourage NCRC to turn over <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> <b>The</b> transfer finally occurred in mid-February 2007.|$|R
50|$|At the Wiechs am Randen {{town hall}} {{there are some}} {{remaining}} border markers that had become obsolete with <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> in 1967; and in Büttenhardt, at the old school house, some old border markers from the 1930s {{have been used to}} frame bushes planted around the enclave.|$|R
50|$|On March 26, 2001, the City Council met {{to vote on}} <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> proposal. At this meeting, the {{citizens}} were given a few specifics of the deal. According to the Council, the Oakland Village Shopping Center was worth $2,700,000, and the current City Hall was worth $2,300,000. Councilman Jerry Oberholtzer estimated that renovation of the shopping center for city use {{would be in the}} $2,500,000 range. He also estimated that to renovate City Hall for future needs would run the city the same cost. More opponents than supporters spoke at the meeting, and a few senior citizens presented a petition against relocating their center which was part of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> plan. <b>The</b> City Council voted 3-1 in favor of the swap; Councilman Troy Carter was the only dissenting vote.|$|R
50|$|On 7 July 2011 the Trustees {{announced}} {{the results of}} the consultation in that 4,000 + responses had been received and 86% were in favour of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> to correct <b>the</b> abuse of the usage of the Rugby Club and to change the objects of the Trust to allow the Leisure Centre to remain on open space.|$|R
5000|$|Mining of the Resolution Copper deposit in Pinal County, {{potentially}} the largest copper mine in Arizona, is stalled pending a proposed <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> with <b>the</b> federal government. [...] Resolution Copper has proposed {{to give the}} federal government 4500 acre of environmentally sensitive land in Arizona {{in exchange for the}} 3000 acre proposed mine site.

50|$|Mike Weger was {{involved}} in <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> at M-24 and Scripps rd to clear cut and develop previously state owned <b>land.</b> (orion review). <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> was deemed controversial and took several years of fighting with local city officials to go through. After years of being unable to obtain a zoning change, or a buyer, the property went into foreclosure and was returned to the state. It has since been sold to a private company and is currently under construction for a new housing development.|$|R
5000|$|The St Clair {{homestead}} {{was later}} compulsorily {{acquired by the}} Council and demolished {{to make way for}} the St Clair Recreation Centre. In 2008 the Charles Sturt Council proposed a <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> between 4.7 hectares of the Reserve (including the St Clair Oval) with an adjoining contaminated site on the former Actil factory land. This was proposed to allow residential development on the parklands and Oval site. Despite community opposition, including a legal challenge by a group of local residents, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> proceeded in late 2009. The Council voted 13 to 3 to proceed with <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> and transfer <b>the</b> <b>land</b> to <b>the</b> State Government's <b>Land</b> Management Corporation (now known as Renewal SA). This was despite concerns raised by local residents over the unequal nature of <b>the</b> <b>swap</b> (in both <b>land</b> value and open space) and the loss of the park. As of July 2013, the original park remains undeveloped. The Parliament's Upper House has voted to launch another inquiry into the swap and the South Australian chapter of the Returned Service League has voted to support the motion to have the original park retained as a war memorial, both to realise the 1942 petition, and to honour the scattered ashes of war veterans.' ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap,</b> CPS now owns half of Ficke park. The CPS owned half {{contains}} the shelters (that are no longer available for rental), the tennis courts (which no longer have nets), the playground and the basketball court. When construction for the new school begins, all these facilities will be lost. Some {{are scheduled to be}} rebuilt in the remaining half of the park.|$|R
50|$|On March 5, 2001, {{the city}} {{held its first}} public hearing on <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap.</b> Over 100 {{citizens}} attended the meeting to support the idea, while {{more than a dozen}} showed up to oppose it. A few cited a recent $79,000 roof job on City Hall, {{and the fact that the}} swap would benefit the church more than the city, as reasons to back out of the deal.|$|R
50|$|In December 2014, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, {{which would give}} <b>land</b> sacred to <b>the</b> Apache in Arizona to Resolution Copper Mine RCM, a joint venture owned by Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> {{necessary}} {{to build the}} ring road through the reserve was rejected in a referendum by the Nation in 2009, and the City of Calgary announced that alternative plans will put the ring road on municipal and provincial lands only.

5000|$|According to a June 1992 Claims Court ruling [...] CST had {{purchased}} the original site in 1986 for $250,976, then had invested millions [...] in building an underground vault on the property. But the Federal Register record says both properties were valued at only $28,000 {{at the time}} of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> in August 1992. However, footage from KRQE TV shows the presence of a vault built into the mountainside between the runway and the CST logo.|$|R
50|$|Later in 2006, Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone aided in {{bringing}} FRIT and IKEA together {{to come up}} with a feasible redevelopment plan consistent with the new vision. FRIT and IKEA agreed to trade parcels, moving IKEA inland from its initial site and leaving the waterfront open for FRIT to create pedestrian friendly, mixed-use development. This new plan was welcomed by those who had previously opposed the IKEA development. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> was executed in October 2009 solidifying the vision of the district.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Gould <b>land</b> <b>swap</b> {{deal was}} finally {{approved}} by the city council on November 1, 2007. It had taken 22 months to change local zoning regulations so Gould was exempted from building housing on the new site.|$|R
