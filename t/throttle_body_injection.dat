5000|$|The LK0 engine {{first used}} TBI (<b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Injection)</b> for fuel {{delivery}} and was rated at [...] at 5000 RPM and 107 lbft Nm at 2400 RPM from 1991 to 1994.|$|E
5000|$|From 1984 to 1988 the {{standard}} G10 engine used a hemispherical head carbureted design with mechanical lifters. From 1989 to 2001 the engine received updates {{in the form}} of <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> and hydraulic lifters. A detuned [...] unit, with a slightly different camshaft, two-ring pistons and differently tuned engine control unit, was used in the ultra-fuel-efficient Geo Metro XFi model, which delivered as much as 58 miles per gallon. In the US, the G10 in the 2000 Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American-sold vehicle to use <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> for fuel delivery.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, the LTD {{got a new}} grille {{with the}} revived Ford blue oval emblem and <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> became available.|$|R
50|$|The NHRA (starting in 2016) requires, and the PDRA Extreme Pro Stock permits, cars to use {{electronically-controlled}} <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> systems.|$|R
5000|$|... 1983 Cavaliers offered <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection,</b> and a V6 engine became {{available}} in 1985. The 1984 models received a mild facelift featuring quad headlights.|$|R
50|$|Cadillac {{referred}} to this new TBI (<b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection)</b> fuel system as Digital Fuel Injection (DFI); this particular induction system was later adopted by other GM divisions, except on Oldsmobile V8s, and was used well into the 1990s on GM trucks.|$|E
50|$|The SR20Di is a 2.0 L (1998 cc) DOHC engine. It {{produces}} 122 PS (89 kW). Bore {{and stroke}} are 86 mm and 86 mm. Similar to the 1.8 liter version except for bigger displacement with a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> system.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} often used with {{computerised}} carburettors or <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> systems but is typically not used with multi-point fuel injection, {{as the problem}} of fuel falling out of suspension does not occur when the fuel injectors are located close to the inlet valves.|$|E
5000|$|This engine {{replaced}} the LQ5 {{and was used}} from 1987 until 1989. it feature <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> and produced [...] and 108 lbft Nm of torque.|$|R
50|$|The {{carbureted}} LL2 ("R-code") {{was produced}} from 1982 to 1988. Another LL2 ("R-code") with <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> was produced from 1986 to 1993. Output of the TBI version was 125 hp.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1990 model year, GM {{replaced}} the 2.0 L engine with a stroked version displacing 2.2 L; with <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> (TBI). Commonly called the 2.2, it produced [...] and 120 lbft Nm of torque.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{significant}} {{changes were made}} in 1987. These included an improved cylinder head, intake manifold and <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> module, a more-modern serpentine belt with an automatic spring-loaded tensioner for the accessories, and a distributorless ignition system (DIS). This revision to the engine increased power to [...]|$|E
5000|$|... 1986: Introduced as {{a running}} change {{late in the}} 1985 model year, a CHMSL/third brake light was added to all {{versions}} of the Grand Marquis (and all American-market cars). Multi-port fuel injection is introduced on the 5.0 L engines to replace the older <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> systems.|$|E
5000|$|Starting {{with the}} 1986 model year, the AMC straight-4 engines used a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>{{injection}}</b> (TBI) or single-point, {{fuel injection system}} with a new fully computerized engine control. In addition to cycling the fuel injector (pulse-width time, on-off), the engine control computer also determined the ignition timing, idle speed, exhaust gas recirculation, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The LU5 5.0L: The new {{high-performance}} [...] "Crossfire Fuel Injection" [...] 5.0L V8, which {{employed a}} twin <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system {{similar to that}} used in the 1982 Corvette's [...] "Crossfire" [...] 5.7L, and produced 165 hp.|$|R
5000|$|A stroked {{version of}} the 1.8 L engine, {{displacing}} 2.0 L, was introduced midway through 1982, to provide more low-rpm power for the J cars. This engine replaced the 1.8 L engine altogether and had <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection.</b> It produces [...]|$|R
50|$|Depending on sanctioning {{body and}} class, engines may either be four-barrel carburetors or <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> {{electronic}} fuel <b>injection</b> {{and must be}} a naturally aspirated intake system.|$|R
50|$|Digital fuel {{injection}} {{refers to a}} {{fuel injection}} system that uses a digital signal from an onboard electronic control unit (ECU) to admit fuel into a carburetor style intake. While {{similar to that of}} <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection,</b> the system uses no sensors to help regulate the fuel flow.Instead, it uses a signal from the ECU previously programmed by the tuner.|$|E
50|$|This {{system is}} used on certain 1981-83 models. There were two {{different}} EEC-III modules: Feedback Carburetor (FBC) and Central Fuel Injection (CFI; similar to GM's <b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Injection).</b> The module size and shape were approximately {{the same as the}} EEC-II and still utilized the external memory module. The two modules had differently keyed connectors to prevent accidental insertion in the wrong vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, a 239 in³ (3.9 L) V6 {{originally}} {{developed for the}} Dodge Dakota mid-size pickup replaced the 225 in³ (3.7 L) Slant Six, and <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> {{was given to the}} 318 V8. The 360 in³ (5.9 L) V8 gaining fuel injection and a roller camshaft in 1989. In 1990, rear wheel antilock brakes were made optional, along with a heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|The G13 is an {{inline-four}} engine utilizing {{aluminum alloy}} for the block, cylinder head and pistons. Displacing 1.3 L (1324 cc) for the G13A and (1298 cc/79 cu in) {{for all other}} G13 engines, fuel delivery is either through a carburetor, <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> or multi-point fuel injection.|$|R
5000|$|The CA18(i) is a {{naturally}} aspirated engine it delivers [...] at 5200 rpm. The fuel in this engine is not delivered via Multi Port Fuel Injection (E letter code on MPFI engines), it's instead delivered by <b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> Fuel <b>Injection</b> hence the (i) letter on the engine code. 83.0 x 83.6 mm bore and stroke, [...]|$|R
5000|$|The VG30i is a 3 L (2,960 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1986 through 1989. It features a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system. It {{has a long}} crank snout, a cylinder head temperature sensor positioned behind the timing belt cover, and a knock sensor in the cylinder valley (on California models only). It produces [...] at 4,800 rpm and 226 Nm at 2,800 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{base model}} {{with the lowest}} price and lowest {{standard}} (vinyl seats) interior, instrumentation, engine output and transmission. It was only available as a Hatchback. Engine was D15B1 16V SOHC, with dual port <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection,</b> [...] with restrictor on the tandem valve, and catalytic converter integrated into the exhaust manifold. Manual transmissions were 4-speed with cable operated clutch. Automatic four-speed transmission was also available.|$|E
50|$|And for 1991, the 700R4 {{was renamed}} to 4L60. The TBI (<b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection)</b> system {{used on the}} Blazer's {{standard}} 5.7-liter V-8 had longer throttle shaft bearings, new throttle return springs, and improved fuel mixture distribution. The 5.7-liter V-8 also had new heavy-duty intake valves and powdered metal camshaft sprockets. Standard on all engines was a lighter more powerful 100-amp CS130 alternator. Two new exterior colors, Brilliant Blue and Slate Metallic were offered.|$|E
5000|$|... 1998 - The Metro now {{carried the}} Chevrolet nameplate, along with new {{front and rear}} fascias and a SOHC 16v design I-4 1.3L engine with a {{horsepower}} increase of 12%. Electronic ignition replaced the distributor, and MPFI (Multiport Fuel Injection) replaced the TBI (<b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> <b>Injection).</b> The new motor offered more HP, torque, and higher fuel economy. This I-4 engine replaced the older 8v 4 cylinder, but the 3-cylinder engine remained unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|This {{engine was}} similar to the LQ5 however it did not use <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection,</b> instead it had a 2-barrel carburetor. This engine was used in the Chevrolet S-10 and GMC S-15 compact pickup trucks and their Blazer and Jimmy {{counterparts}} until 1985, when it was replaced by the 2.5 L Tech IV engine. This engine produced [...] @ 4600 RPM and 108 lbft Nm @ 2400 RPM.|$|R
50|$|The EJ series {{engine was}} offered. in both 1.8 and 2.0 liter displacements. The engine has either single or double {{overhead}} camshaft architecture and pent-roof, cross flow cylinder firing chambers. The 2.0 liter fuel delivery was managed with sequential multiport fuel injection, and the 1.8 liter engine used a modified fuel delivery system with single point <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> called SPFI. The DOHC 2.0 liter non turbocharged engine had a dual stage intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|Most fuel {{injected}} vehicles use a pleated paper filter {{element in the}} form of a flat panel. This filter is usually placed inside a plastic box connected to the <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> with ductwork. Older vehicles that use carburetors or <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> typically use a cylindrical air filter, usually a few inches high and between 6 in and 16 in in diameter. This is positioned above the carburetor or <b>throttle</b> <b>body,</b> usually in a metal or plastic container which may incorporate ducting to provide cool and/or warm inlet air, and secured with a metal or plastic lid. The overall unit (filter and housing together) is called the air cleaner.|$|R
5000|$|Engine choice {{initially}} comprised three straight-six units {{starting with}} the base 3.2-litre EFI which utilised a <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> (TBI) or central fuel injection (CFI) induction to give [...] at 4000 rpm and 235 Nm at 3250 rpm. This engine was standard on GL models although very few were sold and many owners of the 3.2-litre found lacklustre torque and the resultant driving behaviour caused increased fuel consumption versus the 3.9. Ford discontinued the engine circa December 1988.|$|E
5000|$|From 1985 to 1989 Pathfinders were {{available}} {{with either the}} Nissan VG30i 3.0 L V6 ( [...] , 162 lbft Nm torque), or the Nissan Z24i 2.4 L (...) I4 (the same engine choices as the Nissan Hardbody Truck). In 1990 the V6 received an upgrade from <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection</b> to a multi point fuel injection system. This engine {{was known as the}} VG30E, and was rated at [...] and 180 lbft Nm torque. Also in 1990, the Z24i was replaced with the KA24E. The first generation continued until 1995.|$|E
5000|$|Engineering {{advances}} {{allowed the}} company to begin increasing displacement and output again. A bored-out (to 92 mm) 273 cuin L 4.5 version was introduced in 1988 with [...] and <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> <b>injection.</b> Various versions of this engine were built from this introduction {{to the end of}} production in 1992 including a high-output LW2 version with multiport fuel injection which produced [...] and 270 lbfft Nm for the Allante. Outside of the Allante, Cadillac introduced a port fuel-injected 4.5 L V8 engine in 1990 with [...] and 245 lbfft Nm across their car line up.|$|E
5000|$|For 1989, the 5.9 L V8 also {{received}} <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> for a 20 hp (15 kW) gain. Rear ABS also became standard equipment. Additionally, Dodge {{introduced a new}} overdrive automatic transmission for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9 L V6 and 5.2 L V8. An [...] "O/D Off" [...] pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear {{was added to the}} message center. The A727 automatic saw continued use for heavy-duty applications.|$|R
50|$|The fuel-injected version {{referenced}} above was denoted as the Z24i (<b>Throttle</b> <b>Body</b> Fuel <b>Injection)</b> and {{was first}} {{available in the}} Nissan Model 720 ST pickup during the 1985 model year and was replaced in 1990 by the KA24E engine and they share the same bellhousing pattern. Beside the fuel-injection, a significant change for the Z24i was the addition of an optical crank angle sensor in the distributor rather than a vacuum advance and ignition module. This allowed the JECS throttle-body injection system to identify cylinder #1 top dead center (TDC).|$|R
5000|$|Sales did improve {{over the}} 1991 model year, with some 7,663 Custom Cruisers sold for the 1991 model run. Sales slipped {{to just over}} 4,300 in 1992, however, and GM {{discontinued}} production. The 1992 model year offered a 5.7 L (350 in³) Chevrolet V8. This engine was also equipped with <b>throttle</b> <b>body</b> fuel <b>injection</b> and was rated at , and 300 lbft Nm of torque compared to the standard 305's [...] and 255 lbft Nm of torque. This generation was not sold in Canada. The last Custom Cruiser was assembled on June 5, 1992.|$|R
