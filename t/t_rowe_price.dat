50|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> kicked off more {{assertive}} growth than before, moving {{to its current}} location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> launched {{a joint venture with}} British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.|$|E
50|$|<b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> {{held its}} initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986. Shortly thereafter, the firm began {{establishing}} larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, {{beginning with a}} Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G. This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> International. Also in 1999, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> {{was added to the}} S&P 500 Index.|$|E
50|$|On the {{strength}} of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000. In 2001, the company launched <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds. In 2010, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest. Since 2000, <b>T.</b> <b>Rowe</b> <b>Price</b> has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.|$|E

Much higher energies were achieved when they borrowed a twelve-inch spark unit (around 190kV) from Sir Charles Todd. Mr Rowe ran the X-ray clinic for Fauldings in 1896 and 1897 when Barbour sold the unit to Sir Joseph Verco.|$|R
