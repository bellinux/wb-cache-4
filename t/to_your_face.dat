25|$|I've Grown Accustomed <b>to</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Face</b> (February 5, 1967) – Kermit and Yorick from Sam and Friends are {{featured}} in this act. Kermit (dressed as a girl) lip-synchs to Rosemary Clooney's cover version as Yorick eats {{his way out of}} the handkerchief he's under and tries to eat Kermit. This was previously done on The Jack Paar Show and later reprised on this show April 21, 1968, and reprised on August 29, 2011, at the D23 Expo by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph (who was operating a rebuilt version of Kermit's pre-frog form) and Brian Henson (who was operating a rebuilt and redesigned version of Yorick). The act was even done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!). Clooney's cover was used for that event.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} we would go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come to tell you <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>face</b> that we would pay you if {{we thought we were}} liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't done anything wrong. We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E

2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>face,</b> letting you know very well that he's lying, and make you love him for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Whittaker of Hardcore Gamer {{gave the}} game a 3.5/5 and wrote: [...] "Evaluating NBA 2K16 {{as a whole}} is {{actually}} an interesting challenge. On one hand, this is arguably the most mechanically sound sports game on the market and the gameplay improvements that Visual Concepts made are downright superb. The issue here lies with the decision to make Livin ‘Da Dream the focus and backbone of MyCareer falling flat. There are some moments throughout Spike Lee’s in-game film that might bring a smile <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>face,</b> but this story doesn’t lend itself to this franchise’s gameplay or the video game medium itself. Yes, basketball fans will likely have a great time playing NBA 2K16 for hours on end, but there are too many small steps back here that can’t be ignored. The good news for fans of sports games is that the first misstep in this great franchise is still a very good game, which speaks to how truly fun its gameplay is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon release, {{the film}} opened to {{positive}} reviews. Critics praised the film for its simplicity, its romance, {{saying that it}} was [...] "one of the finest romantic films to come out of Bollywood in 2007". The film's direction and performances were particularly appreciated. Taran Adarsh from indiaFM gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 rating saying it is [...] "as refreshing as an ice-cold watermelon juice in scorching heat." [...] Subhash K. Jha wrote, [...] "...Jab We Met is the kind of cinematic experience that is hard to come by {{in this day and age}} of smoky cynicism and borrowed rage." [...] Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN, who gave the film 3 stars out of 5, described it as [...] "a film bursting with the kind of lovely little moments that'll bring a smile <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>face.</b> Khaled Mohamed, of the Hindustan Times, gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying the film, [...] "is quite a delight, particularly for the chirpy-chirpy-cheep-cheep girl and the retentive, moan-groan boy. Directed with a flair for garnishing even the most abject of circumstances with humour and irony, here’s a feel-cool movie. Wonderful.|$|E

2500|$|The Game {{began as}} a spec screenplay, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris in 1991. It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who put the project in turnaround, where it {{was picked up by}} Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was {{originally}} attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a [...] "fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a [...] situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting". He {{said in an interview that}} his film differs from others of that kind because [...] "movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about [...] "loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it this close <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>face</b> and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'" [...] More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.|$|E
