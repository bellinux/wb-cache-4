500|$|Astral Weeks {{critical}} standing improved greatly over time. [...] It became {{viewed as}} one of rock's greatest records and a culturally significant work. A number of factors afforded the record its canonical reputation in rock criticism: its back story as a commercial underachiever and highly personal work for Morrison, its distinction {{from the rest of}} his discography, his artistic autonomy, the music's song cycle composition, the enigmatic lyrics, and the quality of seriousness and originality as perceived by mature rock audiences and writers. According to Rob Sheffield, it was Morrison's [...] "most beautiful and intense album", the foundation for his [...] "legend", and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners. Lester Bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen, calling it [...] "the rock record with the most significance in my life so far ... a record about people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their ages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend." [...] Irish musician Glen Hansard said it made him think about life with a greater depth of feeling, [...] "with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> imagined." [...] Colin Larkin credited Morrison for fully realizing his ambition to [...] "create without pop's constraints" [...] on Astral Weeks, while AllMusic's William Ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because [...] "unlike any record before or since," [...] it [...] "encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music".|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. It takes all the pressure out {{of being in a}} recording studio. We were able to take our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (<b>Than</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to relate to that situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
