40|$|Myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury {{results from}} severe {{impairment}} of coronary blood supply {{and leads to}} irreversible cell death, with limited therapeutic possibilities. Asiatic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid derived from the <b>tropical</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> Centella asiatica and serves a variety of bioactivities. In this study, we determined the effect of asiatic acid on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and investigated the underlying mechanisms, using an in vitro rat H 9 c 2 cardiomyocytes model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury. Results showed that pre-treatment with asiatic acid significantly augmented cell viability and prevented lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in a concentration-dependent manner after OGD/R exposure. Asiatic acid at 10 μM effectively inhibited apoptotic cell death, suppressed the activities of caspase- 3 and caspase- 9, and reversed Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio in hypoxic H 9 c 2 cells. In addition, asiatic acid improved mitochondrial function, as evidenced by reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased intracellular calcium concentration. Using Western blot assay, we found that asiatic acid promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and subsequent inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β (GSK- 3 β), and induced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α) after OGD/R. The cardioprotective effects of asiatic acid were attenuated by the Akt or HIF- 1 α inhibitor. Taken together, these data suggested that asiatic acid exerted protective effects against OGD/R-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, at least partly via the Akt/GSK- 3 β/HIF- 1 α pathway...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{detect the}} in vitro total phenolics, {{flavonoids}} contents and antioxidant activity of essential oil, various organic extracts from {{the leaves of}} <b>tropical</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> Tetrastigma from Sabah. MethodsThe dry powder leaves of Tetrastigma were extracted with different organic solvent such as hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and aqueous methanol. The total phenolic and total flavonoids contents of the essential oil and various organic extracts such as hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and aqueous ethanol were determined by Folin - Ciocalteu method and the assayed antioxidant activity was determined in vitro models such as antioxidant capacity by radical scavenging activity using α, α-diphenyl- β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. ResultsThe total phenolic contents of the essential oil and different extracts as gallic acid equivalents {{were found to be}} highest in methanol extract (386. 22 mg/g) followed by ethyl acetate (190. 89 mg/g), chloroform (175. 89 mg/g), hexane (173. 44 mg/g), and butanol extract (131. 72 mg/g) and the phenolic contents not detected in essential oil. The antioxidant capacity of the essential oil and different extracts as ascorbic acid standard was in the order of methanol extract > ethyl acetate extract >chloroform> butanol > hexane extract also the antioxidant activity was not detected in essential oil.

Homegardens often act as medicine cabinets, providing easily accessible <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> for household needs. Social structure and social exchanges have been proposed as factors influencing the species diversity that people maintain in their homegardens. Here, we assess the association between the exchange of <b>medicinal</b> knowledge and <b>plant</b> material and <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> richness in homegardens. Using Tsimane' Amazonian homegardens as a case study, we explore whether social organization shapes exchanges of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> knowledge and <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> material. We also use network centrality measures to evaluate people's location and performance in <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> knowledge and plant material exchange networks. Our results suggest that social organization, specifically kinship and gender relations, influences <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> exchange patterns significantly. Homegardens total and <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> species richness are related to gardeners' centrality in the networks, whereby people with greater centrality maintain greater plant richness. Thus, together with agroecological conditions, social relations among gardeners and the culturally specific social structure seem to be important determinants of plant richness in homegardens.

40|$|Background: The Bhutanese Sowa Rigpa {{medicine}} (BSM) uses <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> as {{the bulk}} ingredients. Our {{study was to}} botanically identify subtropical <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> from the Lower Kheng region in Bhutan, transcribe ethnopharmacological uses, and highlight reported pharmacological activities of each plant. Methods: We freely listed the <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> used in the BSM literature, current formulations, and the <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> inventory documents. This {{was followed by a}} survey and the identification of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> in the Lower Kheng region. The botanical identification of each <b>medicinal</b> <b>plant</b> was confirmed using The Plant List, eFloras, and TROPICOS. Data mining for reported pharmacological activities was performed using Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and SciFinder Scholar. Results: We identified 61 subtropical <b>plants</b> as the <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> used in BSM. Of these, 17 plants were cultivated as edible plant species, 30 species grow abundantly, 24 species grow in moderate numbers, and only seven species were scarce to find. All these species grow within the altitude range of 100 â 1800 Â m above sea level. A total of 19 species were trees, and 13 of them were shrubs. Seeds ranked first in the parts usage category. Goshing Gewog (Block) hosted maximum number of <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants.</b> About 52 species have been pharmacologically studied and only nine species remain unstudied. Conclusion: Lower Kheng region is rich in subtropical <b>medicinal</b> <b>plants</b> and 30 species present immediate economic potential that could benefit BSM, Lower Kheng communities and other Sowa Rigpa practicing organizations.
