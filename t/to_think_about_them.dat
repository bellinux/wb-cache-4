It was better, he believed, just <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> Plato expressed hostility to observation and experiment. He taught contempt for the real world and disdain for the practical application of scientific knowledge. Plato's followers succeeded in extinguishing the light of science and experiment that had been kindled by Democritus and the other Ionians.|$|E

40|$|Now that {{multicore}} microprocessors {{have become}} a commodity, it is natural <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> employing <b>them</b> {{in all kinds of}} computing, including high-reliability embedded real-time systems. Appealing aspects of this development include the ability to process more instructions per second and more instructions per watt. However, not all problems are amenable to parallel decomposition, and for those that are, designing a correct scalable solution can be difficult. If there are deadlines or other hard timing constraints the difficulty becomes much greater. This paper reviews some of what is known about multiprocessor scheduling of task systems with deadlines, including recent advances in the analysis of arbitrary sporadic task systems under fixed-priority and earliest-deadline first scheduling polices. It also examines critically the foundations of these theoretical results, including assumptions about task independence and worst-case execution time estimates, with a view toward their practical applicability. ...|$|R

He found Miss Mellerby to be very courteous to him if not gracious; and he had the advantage of not being afraid of her. It did not strike him that because she was the granddaughter of a duke, and because he was a younger son, that therefore he ought not to dare to look at her. He understood very well that she was brought there that Fred might marry her;--but Fred was intent on marrying some one else, and Sophie Mellerby was not a girl to throw her heart away upon a man who did not want it. He had come to Scroope for only three days, but, in spite of some watchfulness {{on the part of the}} Countess, he found his opportunity for speaking before he left the house.

40|$|Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is {{a widely}} used {{communication}} mechanism in local network based distributed operating systems. It is simple, fast, and straightforward to implement.

In this paper we discuss various ways in which these gateways can be organized and show how their application in the Amoeba Distributed Operating System has solved the problems cited above. 1.

60|$|Having her lily {{handkerchief}} in {{token of}} adieu to the departing travellers, Mrs. Lambert and her girls watched them pacing leisurely {{on the first}} few hundred yards of their journey, and {{until such time as}} a tree-clumped corner of the road hid them from the ladies' view. Behind that clump of limes the good matron had many a time watched those she loved best disappear. Husband departing to battle and danger, sons to school, each after the other had gone on his way behind yonder green trees, returning as it pleased Heaven's will at his good time, and bringing pleasure and love back to the happy little family. Besides their own instinctive nature (which to be sure aids wonderfully in the matter), the leisure and contemplation attendant upon their home life serve to foster the tenderness and fidelity of our women. The men gone, there is all day <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> and to-morrow and to-morrow--when there certainly will be a letter--and so on. There is the vacant room to go look at, where the boy slept last night, and the impression of his carpet bag is still on the bed. There is his whip hung up in the hall, and his fishing-rod and basket--mute memorials of the brief bygone pleasures. At dinner there comes up that cherry-tart, half of which our darling ate at two o'clock in spite of his melancholy, and with a choking little sister on each side of him. The evening prayer is said without that young scholar's voice to utter the due responses. Midnight and silence come, and the good mother lies wakeful, thinking how one of the dear accustomed brood is away from the nest. Morn breaks, home and holidays have passed away, and toil and labour have begun for him. So those rustling limes formed, as it were, a screen between the world and our ladies of the house at Oakhurst. Kind-hearted Mrs. Lambert always became silent and thoughtful, if by chance she and her girls walked up to the trees {{in the absence of the}} men of the family. She said she would like to carve their names up on the grey silvered trunks, in the midst of true-lovers' knots, as was then the kindly fashion; and Miss Theo, who had an exceeding elegant turn that way, made some verses regarding the trees, which her delighted parent transmitted to a periodical of those days.|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} small out-of-the-way landing {{places on the}} Thames and the Medway, where I do much of my summer idling. Running water is {{favourable}} to day-dreams, and a strong tidal river {{is the best of}} running water for mine. I like to watch the great ships standing out to sea or coming home richly laden, the active little steam-tugs confidently puffing with them to and from the sea- horizon, the fleet of barges that seem to have plucked their brown and russet sails from the ripe trees in the landscape, the heavy old colliers, light in ballast, floundering down before the tide, the light screw barks and schooners imperiously holding a straight course while the others patiently tack and go about, the yachts with their tiny hulls and great white sheets of canvas, the little sailing-boats bobbing to and fro on their errands of pleasure or business, and--as it is the nature of little people to do--making a prodigious fuss about their small affairs. Watching these objects, I still am under no obligation <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> or even so much as to see them, unless it perfectly suits my humour. As little am I obliged to hear the plash and flop of the tide, the ripple at my feet, the clinking windlass afar off, or the humming steam-ship paddles further away yet. These, with the creaking little jetty on which I sit, and the gaunt high-water marks and low-water marks in the mud, and the broken causeway, and the broken bank, and the broken stakes and piles leaning forward as if they were vain of their personal appearance and looking for their reflection in the water, will melt into any train of fancy. Equally adaptable to any purpose or to none, are the posturing sheep and kine upon the marshes, the gulls that wheel and dip around me, the crows (well out of gunshot) going home from the rich harvest-fields, the heron that has been out a-fishing and looks as melancholy, up there in the sky, as if it hadn't agreed with him. Everything within the range of the senses will, by the aid of the running water, lend itself to everything beyond that range, and work into a drowsy whole, not unlike a kind of tune, but {{for which there is no}} exact definition.|$|E
