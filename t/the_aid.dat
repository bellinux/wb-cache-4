40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> architecture is proposed to improve <b>the</b> quality of <b>aiding</b> estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing <b>the</b> proposed <b>aiding</b> scheme with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R
5000|$|The {{half-halt}} may {{be performed}} two ways, {{both of which}} are commonly used by various skilled horsepeople. The first is a split-second application of <b>the</b> driving <b>aids,</b> to create energy, which is then quickly and immediately harnessed with <b>the</b> restraining <b>aids,</b> and then released. The second is the opposite approach: an application of <b>the</b> restraining <b>aids,</b> asking <b>the</b> horse to [...] "almost halt" [...] and bring its hindquarters under itself in the process, then immediately applying <b>the</b> driving <b>aids</b> to maintain <b>the</b> gait. In both cases, the driving and restraining aids should never be applied for a prolonged period, as that will only cause the horse to lean against the bit, tighten its back, and finally ignore <b>the</b> <b>aids.</b> <b>The</b> yielding of <b>the</b> <b>aids</b> {{is just as important as}} the application of <b>the</b> <b>aids.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} prevent low back pain during dishwashing, we {{developed}} a standing <b>aid</b> for supporting <b>the</b> forward bending posture, and then evaluated the effects of <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> on decreasing load on the low back and legs. Eight female volunteers were asked to wash plates for 60 minutes in each of three working postures: (a) without <b>the</b> standing <b>aid,</b> (b) with <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> under <b>the</b> thighs, and (c) with <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> under <b>the</b> shins. The following were measured: electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), the force applied to <b>the</b> standing <b>aid,</b> <b>the</b> ground reaction force, the bending angle of the trunk, the bending angle of the knee, and local discomfort in body regions. While using <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> under <b>the</b> shins, the muscle load decreased in the low back and legs. While using <b>the</b> standing <b>aid</b> under <b>the</b> thighs, the muscle loads decreased in the low back but increased in the legs.

40|$|Use of loop <b>aiding</b> for facilitating <b>the</b> {{operation}} of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in low Carrier-to-Noise and Interference (CNIR) environments {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. Locata, a terrestrial radio navigation system working on similar principles as GPS, can also make use of loop aiding techniques with some additional advantages. Locata employs dual-frequency and dual-antenna transceivers (LocataLites) allowing a Locata rover receiver to track four signals from each LocataLite. This paper proposes that the carrier tracking loops used for tracking these signals can adaptively aid each other to maintain lock in low CNIR environments. Performance of this proposed scheme is evaluated and an analytical description and test results are presented. Results show that <b>the</b> loop <b>aiding</b> scheme allows potential reduction of the tracking loop bandwidth down to 0. 5 Hz, enabling it to track signals with CNIR as low as 21. 5 dB-Hz. A relationship between <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop’s performance {{and the quality of}} the signal tracked by <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop is also developed and analysed. It is identified that any degradation in the quality of the signal tracked by <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop can affect <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop’s performance. Use of Adaptive Kalman filtering is suggested as a possible solution to this problem and improves the situation by a further 2. 5 dB-Hz. Using an analytical approach, it is also shown that a lower bound on <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop’s expected performance is predictable. I...|$|R
