25|$|According to an {{inspector}} general's report, released in November 2013, identity theft in the United States is blamed for US$4 {{billion worth of}} fraudulent 2012 tax refunds by the IRS. Fraudulent claims were made {{with the use of}} stolen taxpayer identification and Social Security numbers, with returns sent to addresses both in the US and internationally. Following the release of the findings, the IRS stated that it resolved most of the identity theft cases of 2013 within 120 days, while the average time to resolve cases from the 2011/2012 <b>tax</b> <b>period</b> was 312 days.|$|E
25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every <b>tax</b> <b>period</b> a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in the present to provide an {{empirical}} content to differential coefficient of tax [revenue] buoyancy during post <b>tax</b> reform <b>period</b> in India by fitting a double-log regression model with an interaction variable to the stationary time series data based on Augmented - Dicky Fuller [ADF] and Phillips-Parron [PP] Tests. The period after 1992 is considered as post <b>tax</b> reform <b>period</b> to look at the prognostications of tax reforms that had been initiated by the government of India. The regression results illustrate that the estimate of constant gross tax buoyancy is positively significant and more than unity during pre <b>tax</b> reform <b>period</b> illuminating that gross tax is moderately elastic. From this upshot it can be comprehended that a one percent increase in income leads to increase the gross tax revenue by more than one percent, all else equal. Further it can be understood that the average propensity to tax [ratio of Gross Tax Revenue to Gross Domestic Product] was increasing with the increase in Gross Domestic Product during pre <b>tax</b> reform <b>period.</b> The regression coefficient of interaction variable is significantly negative and stumpy showing a downward shift in the degree of tax buoyancy during post <b>tax</b> reform <b>period.</b> The estimate of the tax buoyancy, which was just above the unity during pre <b>tax</b> reform <b>period,</b> is less than unity during post <b>tax</b> reform <b>period</b> evincing the fact that the gross Tax is relatively inelastic. From this it can also be understood that the average propensity to tax is declining with the increase in Gross Domestic Product during post <b>tax</b> reform <b>period.</b> Thus the estimates of gross tax buoyancy during pre and post <b>tax</b> reform <b>periods</b> are not stable. ...|$|R

40|$|Book {{income is}} got from {{financial}} statement {{which is made}} based on financial accounting standard and taxable income is got from financial statement which is made based on income tax act. Because there are fundamental differences used for calculating and arranging, so book income will be different from taxable income. One of the elements which cause these differences is time differences or temporary differences. This time differences can or can 't be recorded and presented in a financial statement as deformed <b>tax</b> (inter <b>period</b> <b>tax</b> allocation or no inter <b>period</b> <b>tax</b> allocation). There are three methods {{which can be used}} to record and report deferred tax: deferred method, asset/liability method and net-of-tax method. Besides to cover time differences, deferred tax {{can also be used to}} record net operating loss (NOL). Each method will use separate account to record deferred tax. From three methods inter <b>period</b> <b>tax</b> allocation, only asset/liability method which fulfills the presented deferred tax criteria to asset and liability definitions. Deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability which rise from inter <b>period</b> <b>tax</b> allocation asset/liability method conceptually fulfills asset and liability criteria, so that its existence in balance sheet is strong. Meanwhile, deferred tax asset which comes from NOL carry back and NOL carry forward don 't fulfill the asset criteria...|$|R
5000|$|For households, {{determining}} {{the amount of}} aggregate income generated {{over the course of}} a calendar year can be advantageous when calculating the total taxes due for that period. In a number of nations, federal tax agencies provide some incentives for spouses to file joint tax returns, rather than each spouse filing separately. By choosing to aggregate their generated income for the <b>tax</b> <b>period,</b> the household is likely to owe fewer taxes and thus receive a higher joint return than they would have received with individual returns.|$|E

The measure states that any online retailer that generates more than $10,000 in sales via in-state sales affiliates must collect New York sales tax.

50|$|Tax amnesty is a limited-time {{opportunity}} for a specified group of taxpayers to pay a defined amount, in exchange for forgiveness of a tax liability (including interest and penalties) relating to a previous <b>tax</b> <b>period</b> or periods and without fear of criminal prosecution. It typically expires when some authority begins a tax investigation of the past-due tax. In some cases, legislation extending amnesty also imposes harsher penalties on those who are eligible for amnesty but do not take it. Tax amnesty is one of voluntary compliance strategies to increase tax base and tax revenue. Tax amnesty is different from other voluntary compliance strategies in part where tax amnesty usually waives the taxpayers' tax liability.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{government}} was, for {{a period}} of time, concerned that perhaps the Church had been founded as a way for Hensley to avoid paying taxes. In 1985, the ULC began a series of court battles against the IRS to prove its legitimacy as a Church. The courts ruled that like any tax-exempt organization, the ULC would qualify for exempt status year by year, based on its financial activities within the <b>tax</b> <b>period.</b> The ULC was subsequently found to be tax-exempt for some years and not in others. Tax exemption can apply only to organizations and not to individual ministers. Each congregation within the ULC is legally independent and would be required to establish its own exemption via 501(c)3 or rely on existing tax statutes to determine tax-exempt status without regard to the Headquarters or any other ULC entity. The three main ULC sites are not currently 501(c)3.|$|E
50|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every <b>tax</b> <b>period</b> a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would never need to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source.

The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E
