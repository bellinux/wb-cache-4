5000|$|Another useful {{capability}} is <b>to</b> <b>redirect</b> one standard <b>file</b> handle to another. The most popular variation is to merge standard error into standard output so error messages can be processed together with (or alternately to) the usual output. Example: ...|$|R

50|$|In shells {{derived from}} csh (the C shell), the syntax instead appends the & (ampersand) {{character}} <b>to</b> the <b>redirect</b> characters, thus achieving a similar result. The {{reason for this}} is to distinguish between a file named '1' and stdout, i.e. 'cat file 2>1' vs 'cat file 2>&1'. In the first case, stderr is <b>redirected</b> <b>to</b> a <b>file</b> named '1' and in the second, stderr is <b>redirected</b> <b>to</b> stdout.|$|R
50|$|Windows Vista {{improves}} Folder Redirection {{by introducing}} the ability <b>to</b> independently <b>redirect</b> up <b>to</b> 10 user profile sub-folders {{to a network}} location.

50|$|As it {{has been}} already {{explained}} in the previous sections, the erb is used to generate templates. This {{is often used to}} generate web pages or other text files.

50|$|Like many Unix {{commands}}, SAMtool commands {{follow a}} stream model, where data runs through each command as if {{carried on a}} conveyor belt. This allows combining multiple commands into a data processing pipeline. Although the final output can be very complex, {{only a limited number}} of simple commands are needed to produce it. If not specified, the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr) are assumed. Data sent to stdout are printed to the screen by default but are easily <b>redirected</b> <b>to</b> another <b>file</b> using the normal Unix redirectors (> and >>), or to another command via a pipe (|).|$|R
