5|$|What is now Pentonville Road {{was built}} {{as the final}} section of the New Road in 1756, {{connecting}} the City of London to the western suburbs, so that coach traffic could avoid Central London. At the time, the route now covered by Pentonville Road was mostly fields, with Battle Bridge occupying <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>where</b> King's Cross now is. It included a tavern known as Busby's Folly, a meeting place of a drinking group known as the Society of Bull Feathers. It is marked on John Ogilby's map of London in 1675. It was moved around 1780 to Penton Street and renamed the Belvedere Tavern. The current building dates from 1876.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>where</b> the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>where</b> no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached by a thread. Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but perhaps also from fish, for example by snapping at their backs near the water surface. Martill stated that there were many differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough pulling power, and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E

25|$|The album's main {{recording}} sessions {{began in}} September 2012, and lasted for approximately four months. The band decided to record songs at Yamaguchi's home studio, {{as the group}} had grown tired of having to return to recording studios often due to their repeated commercial tie-up offers. They originally intended to re-record some parts of songs at a large recording studio, but instead used the home-recorded takes. The band felt that recording at Yamaguchi's home had a different atmosphere, as the location did not come with the pressure of time limits and recording staff, which made these sessions feel less like work. For the Sakanaction album sessions, the band found that they felt free to record any music that they wanted to, and that the location allowed for the band to develop a different sound, as this was <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>where</b> Yamaguchi usually listened to music. Yamaguchi described these home sessions as feeling like an after school club, how everyone worked together {{in front of a}} computer.
