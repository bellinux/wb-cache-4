(SESB) and also the largest hydro station in Sabah, Malaysia with installed capacity of 3 units of 22 MW each. Due to degrading river water quality, the previous duplex strainers or filters with manual backwash of the plant cooling water system (CWS) were not practically efficient to remove the accumulated trash load. The cause of the repeatable failure from the substituted auto-backwash strainers was thoroughly investigated, and {{it was found that}} the failure was due to the trapped trash and/or the sediment trapped in the autobackwash filters which ultimately clogged <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> <b>discharge.</b> Several technical solutions were proposed to rectify the problem, but the open canal with auto-strainer system was the optimum solution. The canal solution was selected base on the system reliability, cost benefit, and future water quality of Padas River. Analytical and CFD solution using commercial CFD software were used to design the system. The open canal with auto-strainer system was installed and it was found that a significant amount of sediment and trash have been separated from the river water. This dramatically improves the operational reliability of the station cooling water system while maintains sufficient water flow rate and pressures...|$|E

Although diamond-like carbon coating materials have been studied for decades, no indis-putably successful commercial biomedical applications for high load situations exist today. High internal stress, leading to insufficient adhesion of thick coatings, is the evident reason behind this delay of the break-through of DLC coatings for applications. Excellent adhesion of thick DLC coatings is of utmost importance for load-bearing applications. According to this review superior candidate material for articulating implants is thick and adherent DLC on both sliding surfaces.

The lower frequency breathing-mode current oscillations are inherent to each thruster and could impact thruster operation and power processing unit (PPU) design. The design of <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> output <b>filter,</b> in particular, <b>the</b> output capacitor {{is important because it}} supplies the high peak current oscillations that the thruster demands. However, space-rated, high-voltage capacitors are not readily available and can have significant mass and volume. So, it is important for a PPU designer to know what is the minimum amount of capacitance required to operate a thruster. Through Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis modeling and electrical measurements on the Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding thruster, it was shown that the harness impedance between the power supply and the thruster is the main contributor towards generating voltage ripple at the thruster. Also, increasing the size of <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>filter</b> capacitor, as previously implemented during thruster tests, does not reduce the voltage oscillations.

40|$|As the {{equipment}} builder of the team, I {{was responsible for}} building the treadle pump, <b>the</b> sand <b>filter</b> tank, <b>the</b> hand pump, and generating the instructions for each equipment. Each team member was responsible for {{certain parts of the}} water purification system, but everyone worked cohesively on all parts of the design when assistance was necessary. The original design for the treadle pump was a two-man powered pump which discharged water at 15 gallons per minute. Since our system only required {{less than half of the}} flow rate, and required another person to operate the bicycle, the pump was redesigned as a one-man powered pump which discharges water at five gallons per minute. The treadle pump consists of two pistons which can draw and discharge water. One piston will draw water from a well and discharge it to <b>the</b> sand <b>filter,</b> while <b>the</b> other piston will draw water from <b>the</b> sand <b>filter</b> and <b>discharge</b> it to an empty container for further treatment. Once the water is treated, a hand pump will draw clean water from a storage reservoir. The hand pump was assembled using PVC parts found in a local hardware store. The hand pump can also discharge water at five gallons per minute. The experiment for the treadle pump was conducted with the assistance from Mr. Hasan. Each piston was tested three times for the volume and the number of strokes at time intervals ranging from 30 to 120 seconds. The same procedure was followed for the experiment with the hand pump. <b>The</b> sand <b>filter</b> was assembled using an 18 gallon plastic bucket, all-purpose gravel, all-purpose sand, a PVC mechanism, and wool felt cut in specific dimensions. Before testing for <b>filtering</b> capability, <b>the</b> sand was cleaned by pumping clean water through <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> for approximately five hours. Once <b>the</b> sand <b>filter</b> was ready for testing, water containing dirt and other natural debris was poured into <b>the</b> <b>filter.</b> Three trials were performed and three samples were collected before and after running it through <b>the</b> sand <b>filter.</b> <b>The</b> turbidity was tested using a turbidimeter and the turbidity level of all samples were below five NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units) which is the maximum turbidity level allowed for drinking water. The pictorial instructions for the treadle pump, sand <b>filter,</b> and <b>the</b> hand pump were prepared using computer software such as Paint and photographs taken when each instruments were assembled. The instructions were captioned in English along with dimensions indicated in English units.
