5|$|In children, the {{penicillamine}} test may be used. A 500 mg oral dose of penicillamine is administered, {{and urine}} collected for 24 hours. If this {{contains more than}} 1600 μg (25 μmol), it is a reliable indicator of Wilson's disease. This <b>test</b> <b>has</b> not been validated in adults.|$|E
5|$|No single <b>test</b> <b>has</b> {{adequate}} {{sensitivity and}} specificity to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease. A large multisite U.S. study found that cervical motion tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion increases {{the sensitivity of the}} CDC diagnostic criteria from 83 percent to 95 percent. However, even the modified 2002 CDC criteria do not identify women with subclinical disease.|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results <b>test</b> <b>has</b> since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E

5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA <b>test</b> <b>has</b> been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{calls the}} medical {{examiner}} who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle Parker back to the ranch and that Parker's blood <b>test</b> <b>has</b> revealed his father's blood type in his stomach. Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was in the bathroom, sick, {{and then they were}} attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion is still in its cage.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by cervical screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a cervical smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of cervical tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap <b>test</b> <b>has</b> been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E

5|$|The Lemon <b>test</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap <b>test</b> <b>has</b> identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
