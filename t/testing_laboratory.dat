5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed <b>Testing</b> <b>Laboratory</b> for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E
5|$|Casey won a John R. Freeman {{fellowship}} {{from the}} American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1933 to study hydraulics and civil engineering in Germany. For {{the next two}} years, he attended the Technische Hochschule in Berlin, earning a Doctorate in Engineering. His thesis, written in German, was on Geschieb Bewegung, the bedload movement in streams. Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to Eastport, Maine as chief of the Engineering Division at the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project, a New Deal public works project. There, he established a concrete <b>testing</b> <b>laboratory</b> under Charles E. Wuerpel which {{is now part of}} the Structures Laboratory at the Waterways Experiment Station at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Due to political forces, the project came to nothing and was allowed to die. After the Passamaquoddy project fell through, Casey served with the Boston Engineer District on flood control surveys of the Connecticut River Valley.|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study of the}} ability of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and liver imaging tests to detect hepatic metastases was performed. Eighty patients at risk for hepatic metastases but without clinical evidence of disease were <b>tested</b> with 13 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> and three liver imaging <b>tests.</b> No single <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> had greater than 65 % accuracy in the detection of hepatic lesions. No combination of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> increased this accuracy. If the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were used {{with one of the}} liver imaging tests, the accuracy was improved in some combinations to 76 %. The CEA assay when analyzed in patients with colorectal primaries had an accuracy of 79 %. The results show that the <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> alone are not sufficiently accurate to detect liver metastases. Additional accuracy can be obtained by the combined use of a single liver imaging <b>test</b> and selected <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests.</b> Use of all the liver imaging <b>tests</b> and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> lowers the accuracy and increases the expense and thus is unnecessary...|$|R

25|$|Kronrod {{decided that}} {{his best work}} was to help others and most {{importantly}} the terminally ill. He spent his fortune developing milil from a sour milk extract for cancer patients, to fill a shortage of anabol, an expensive drug developed in small quantities by his acquaintance Bogdanov in Bulgaria. He was promised but never acquired an animal <b>testing</b> <b>laboratory</b> so he tested the medicine on himself. Kronrod had no medical degree but he was well-informed in medicine. Milil was a last resort for seriously ill patients and was administered by physicians in one case in a hospital ward A.A. Vishnevskiy reserved for treatments by Kronrod's method. Kronrod himself never gave the drug to patients and through physicians gave it away free. The drug was unapproved and a criminal case was brought against him. He regained his research records when a relative of the plaintiff required milil for treatment and the case was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Brenda, still {{distressed by}} the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal <b>testing</b> <b>laboratory</b> and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, {{the only person in the}} group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not go and look for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.|$|E
