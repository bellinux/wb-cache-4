5|$|In 1913, the IRT, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit, and {{the city}} agreed to the Dual System of Rapid Transit to exp{{and the city}}'s transportation. As part of the agreement, the {{existing}} IRT subway would be split into two north-south lines and a shuttle along 42nd Street. The section of the line south of 42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line stretching from 41st Street and Park Avenue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> running via Lexington Avenue, while {{the section of the}} line north of 42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line heading south under Seventh Avenue. The section along 42nd Street was left as a shuttle to connect the new East Side and West Side Lines.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{department}} ordered a rescue truck for $194,448 ($ today) from 3-D Manufacturing, and a Pierce pumper truck was purchased at $312,777 ($ today) for Scarborough to replace their corroding 1974 Mack truck. A year later, {{the department}} hosted the Westchester County Volunteer Firemen Association Convention, the usual parade with 43 departments, a golf outing, {{and the annual}} meeting and dinner of the Association. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, the department sent some of its engines <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> to cover for units that had left for the World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|Pacino {{was born}} in the East Harlem {{neighborhood}} of New York City, to Sicilian-American parents Salvatore and Rose (née Gerardi) Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old.

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bronx</b> High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Born to a {{coal mining}} family in West Virginia in 1929, Charlton moved <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bronx</b> in New York City during World War II. Enlisting {{out of high}} school in 1946, Charlton served first in {{occupied}} Germany, then occupied Japan in administrative duties before requesting transfer to the front. An African American, Charlton was transferred to the segregated 24th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division fighting in the Korean War. During a battle for Hill 543 near the village of Chipo-ri, Charlton took command of his platoon after its commanding officer was injured, leading it on three successive assaults of the hill. Charlton continued to lead the attack despite mortal wounds until Chinese troops occupying it were destroyed, saving his platoon. For these actions, Charlton was awarded the medal.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 1962, the NYCTA {{announced}} that it had asked the city for money to build a $190,000,000 high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx.</b> The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds {{were given to the}} project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, {{it would have been the}} longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue. The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains. The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the Washington Heights express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
5|$|The Cross-Westchester Expressway, {{which is}} {{maintained}} by the New York State Thruway Authority, is six lanes wide and carries I-287 east to a westbound exit for NY119 that is intertwined with the ramps between the New York State Thruway and NY119/Saw Mill River Parkway. After passing over the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Saw Mill River, the road enters the Village of Elmsford and runs through developed areas as it has a partial diamond interchange with NY9A {{that does not have}} an eastbound exit. The Cross-Westchester Expressway turns southeast from this point and intersects the Sprain Brook Parkway. I-287 widens to eight lanes at this junction and continues to the exit for NY100A. After the NY100A interchange, the freeway leaves Elmsford and turns to the east near residential areas, narrowing to six lanes before coming to an exit for NY100 and NY119 that also has access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River Parkway.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the early 1920s as a parkway between the Bronx River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition {{from the village of}} Bronxville and Yonkers. The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> River, and nearly {{a decade and a half}} after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was worked out in 1951. This new alignment would bypass the parts of Bronxville and Yonkers to construct the freeway.|$|E
