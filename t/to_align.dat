5|$|Animals {{including}} {{birds and}} turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, {{and use the}} field to navigate during migration. Some {{researchers have found that}} cows and wild deer tend <b>to</b> <b>align</b> their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.|$|E
5|$|Greenup's term {{in office}} was marred by accusations that he {{had participated in the}} Burr Conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>align</b> Kentucky with Spain prior to the former's {{separation}} from Virginia, but he vigorously and successfully rebutted these charges. Following his term as governor, he became less active in the political arena. He died on April 27, 1818. Greenup County, Kentucky and its county seat were both named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|In 1824 the Weights and Measures Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of {{weights and measures}} on the British Empire. The effect of this act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than <b>to</b> <b>align</b> them with the metric system.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Parkway is a controlled-access parkway in Glendale, near Luke AFB. Beginning at an {{interchange}} with Loop 303, {{it follows}} the Butler Drive alignment (half a mile south of Olive Avenue) for about 4 miles until turning southeast <b>to</b> <b>align</b> with Northern Avenue right before its current terminus at Dysart Road. It {{is intended to}} relieve heavy traffic on Northern Avenue, some being contributed by the nearby military base.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} <b>to</b> <b>align</b> along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles {{are produced by}} electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend <b>to</b> <b>align</b> with or against the field.|$|E
5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way <b>to</b> <b>align</b> a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director <b>to</b> <b>align</b> their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates <b>to</b> <b>align,</b> front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but <b>to</b> <b>align</b> himself with industrialists.|$|E

Between 1951 and 1965 (following Indonesian independence), southern Sulawesi faced a turbulent period as the Darul Islam separatist movement fought for an Islamic state in Sulawesi. The 15 years of guerrilla warfare led to massive conversions to Christianity.|$|E
