5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted.

25|$|Early experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss {{engineer}} François Isaac de Rivaz {{built an}} engine powered by internal combustion of a {{hydrogen and oxygen}} mixture. In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in 1860, covering some nine kilometres in about <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> A <b>later</b> version was propelled by coal gas. A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in 1884.|$|R
5|$|A second {{mandatory}} {{roll call}} {{took place in}} the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water.

5|$|Around 04:00 on June 25, the KPA's 5th Division {{began its}} first {{attacks on the}} ROK 10th Regiment's forward positions. <b>Three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the 766th Regiment's two battalions landed at the village of Imwonjin, using motor and sail boats to land troops and {{mustering}} South Korean villagers to assist in setting up supplies. The two battalions separated; one headed into the T'aeback Mountains and the second advanced north toward Samcheok. At this point, the ROK 8th Division, under heavy attack from the front and aware of attacks in the rear, urgently requested reinforcements. It was denied these reinforcements, as ROK higher commanders informed the division commander that the ROK Army was under heavy attack across {{the entirety of the}} 38th parallel and had no reinforcements to spare.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that wing of the bridge, penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E

5|$|At 5a.m.AST (0900UTC) August 16 the {{respective}} governments of St. Lucia and Dominica issued hurricane warnings {{in anticipation of}} Hurricane Dean's imminent approach. In Dominica, a dozen and a half tourists were evacuated to concrete shelters. The government of Dominica also canceled leave for emergency service personnel and evacuated Princess Margret Hospital, fearing that its roof might be vulnerable to the storm's winds. At {{the same time the}} Meteorological Service of Barbados issued a tropical storm warning for Barbados and a tropical storm watch for St. Vincent. <b>Three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> at 8 a.m. AST (1200 UTC), the Meteorological Service of Antigua issued a tropical storm watch for Montserrat, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Barbuda. Shortly thereafter the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service issued a tropical storm watch for Grenada and its dependencies.|$|E
5|$|At landfall, a trough was {{accelerating}} Nora northwards, {{causing it}} to reach a forward speed of 30 mph (50 km/h). Late on September 25 (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the continental United States at the California-Arizona state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> while located between Blythe and Needles, California. Nora reached Arizona while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so. Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the north-northeast. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible {{for a period of}} near hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City, Utah Doppler weather radar. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E

5|$|On 24 November, {{some of the}} French ships {{traveled}} to Tangier, where they picked up Consul Julius Doazan and his secretary, Fleurat, on Narval. Later that evening, Caton reached Salé and offered safe passage to Rabat for the British consul Elton and his family, {{in anticipation of the}} bombardment of the city. The following day, at 11:00a.m., Caton anchored between the cities of Rabat and Salé. Its commander demanded an apology over the thefts and raids and immediate repayment for the stolen goods, under threat of bombardment.

5|$|After passing {{just north}} of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the {{waterway}} between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This {{marked the first time}} on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00UTC on November9, the center was beginning to become exposed from the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00UTC on November9, Megh weakened further into a severe cyclonic storm, and degraded further to a cyclonic storm by six hours later. While just offshore Yemen, the circulation slowed and turned to the northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00UTC on November10 the storm weakened to a deep depression, and <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> Megh made landfall in southwestern Yemen northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55km/h (35mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00UTC on November10.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone {{bypassed}} Socotra, its convective core became better defined due {{to improved}} outflow. On 2November, Chapala entered the Gulf of Aden, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record in that region. At 12:00UTC that day, the IMD downgraded {{the system to}} a very severe cyclonic storm, after Chapala had been an extremely severe cyclonic storm for 78hours. The structure became disorganized that day due to increased easterly wind shear and interaction with the Arabian Peninsula to the north, causing cooler and drier air to enter the circulation. Around this time, the storm began moving more to the west-northwest toward Yemen, rounding the southwestern periphery of a ridge. Between 01:0002:00UTC on 3November, Chapala made landfall near Mukalla with winds of 120km/h (75mph). This marked the first hurricane-intensity landfall for Yemen on record, and the first severe cyclonic storm to hit the country since May 1960. According to the JTWC, Chapala moved ashore and immediately turned back over water, although the agency soon reassessed the center as being over land. Chapala quickly weakened over land, degenerating into a depression by 00:00UTC on 4November, and weakening into a remnant low pressure area <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the National Hurricane Center {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the National Hurricane Center noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E
50|$|It was {{revealed}} via changes to {{electronic program guide}} systems and through an inadvertent image change on the Weather Channel media kit website that the shows time slots would be given to a relaunched version of Weather Center, which contains a mix of the traditional Evening Edition format {{as well as new}} segments. Weekends were also slated to feature PM Edition Weekend in place of Evening Edition, but only for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> - it <b>later</b> turned out that Weather Center was to take this over too.

5000|$|After {{two hours}} and four waves of attack, with the {{intermittent}} lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to disintegrate their formations. The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter. The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> Cilliers noted <b>later</b> that [...] "we left the Kafirs {{lying on the ground}} as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop." ...|$|R
30|$|The next {{visit from}} the teacher is <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> <b>later,</b> and the {{students}} {{are on their way}} to leave for the afternoon break. One student wonders if they have done it wrong. The teacher answers by saying, “I hope not. I trust that you have performed it correctly”. The teacher is there six minutes, and then he walks away. Thus, even though the teacher has not given practical instruction to the students on how to perform the task, he argues that they should know how it is supposed to be performed. In this situation the students apparently are seeking confirmation for their performance, while the teacher takes it for granted. Despite the long time between the visits from the teacher and the students’ obvious inability to perform the assigned task, the teacher perceives it as laziness from the students. The students argue that it is because they do not know what to do and the teacher never seems to be around so they can ask. The teacher comments that they can always look for him if there are any problems. The students all agree that it is possible, but that it very rarely happens. It is easier to just sit and wait for the teacher. In total the teacher was with these students for fifteen minutes of this day. The teacher’s engagement with the task clearly affected the learning outcome for these students. Whether or not the teacher instructs the students verbally, it seems important that the task be demonstrated in a practical sense. The transformation of words and drawings into reality is thereby a key issue for the students’ learning outcome.|$|R
5|$|At around 1600UTC on August26, the National Hurricane Center issued {{hurricane}} watches for Dominica, Martinique, St. Martin, Anguilla, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Six hours later, {{the watch}} was upgraded to a hurricane warning for Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Local meteorological agencies {{on the islands}} also declared small craft advisories. The local government in Montserrat mobilized the 100 member police force and 50 off-duty volunteer army members. Supermarkets, hardware stores, banks, and pharmacies were specially opened for residents to purchase plywood, canned food, bottled water, and other hurricane kit items. Around 1300UTC on August27, the hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique was discontinued as Gustav no longer posed {{a direct threat to}} the islands. <b>Three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> all watches and warnings were discontinued except for Antigua and Barbuda where a tropical storm warning and St. Martin where a tropical storm watch were in place.

At this time, the hurricane watch area was modified to Tampico to Tuxpan, and a hurricane warning was issued from Tampico to Veracruz. The following day, this hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning following Nate's weakening trend. All hurricane watches were discontinued, and during the afternoon hours, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Maria, Environment Canada declared {{a tropical storm}} watch for the coast of Newfoundland on September15, which stretched from Arnolds Cove to Brigus South. <b>Three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> it was upgraded to a hurricane watch, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect from Arnolds Cove to Jones Harbor. At 0600UTC the following day, the watches and warnings were replaced by a hurricane warning, and areas between Brigus South and Charlottestown, Newfoundland were placed under a tropical storm warning. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued at 2100UTC on September16. While becoming absorbed by a front on September16, Maria made landfall on {{the southern tip of}} the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, where winds of 64mph (103km/h) were recorded. Offshore, winds reached up to 77mph (124km/h). The capital city of St. John's experienced heavy rain, though not to the extent that had been forecast, as the storm moved through the peninsula faster than predicted.|$|E
