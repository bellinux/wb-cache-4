5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger than those of <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and {{were similar to those}} of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. <b>The</b> <b>gray</b> whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E

5|$|In the dry season, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> {{mouse lemur}} faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{mouse lemur}}s, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, Governor Stanley {{announced}} {{publicly that}} {{the main thrust of}} his legislative proposal would be to withhold funds from any local school district which integrated. In response, Gray called a meeting of <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Commission to consider the governor's proposal. Stanley said he would not oppose <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Commission's proposal to assign students on the basis of factors other than race (which might lead to some integration). Stanley's concession, the Washington Post reported, was made because it was widely assumed that <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Commission was assumed to be strongly in favor of the pupil assignment plan and the tuition grant proposal.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley plan {{split the}} Executive Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Commission. Attorney General Almond (not a Byrd Organization insider and privately already seeking the governorship) drafted a {{substitute}} school closing bill on July 25 that limited {{the conditions under}} which the governor could close schools but which Almond thought was more likely to pass constitutional muster. On July 26, Southside politicians attempted to force a vote through <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Commission which endorsed the Stanley plan (as redrafted by Almond), but the vote failed. The commission did vote, however, to have Mays draft legislation to implement the proposals contained in <b>the</b> <b>Gray</b> Commission report as well as the governor's recommendations.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} of the railroad from Aberdeen to Hoquiam, beginning in 1898, contributed to the continued importance of logging and lumber in Hoquiam. The importance of logging and related products continued to be relevant to Hoquiam’s economy, and in 1927, a pulp mill was established under <b>the</b> name of <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp Company. A year later, a Pennsylvania company- the Hammerhill Paper Company- became interested in Grays Harbor Pulp Company. When the Pennsylvania company bought stock in <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp Company, <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor pulp Company built a paper mill and became <b>the</b> <b>Grays</b> Harbor Pulp & Paper Company.

5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> mare and returned home.

5|$|In Alaska, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. <b>The</b> <b>gray</b> wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times.

5|$|The {{decline of}} North American wolf populations coincided with {{increasing}} human populations {{and the expansion}} of agriculture. By the start of the 20th century, the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA, excepting some areas of the Appalachians and the northwestern Great Lakes Region. In Canada, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 1870 and 1921, and in Newfoundland around 1911. It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 1850 and 1900. <b>The</b> <b>gray</b> wolf's decline in the prairies began with the extermination of the American bison and other ungulates in the 1860s–70s. From 1900–1930, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada, because of intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species. <b>The</b> <b>gray</b> wolf was exterminated by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 1960, except in Alaska and northern Minnesota. The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s, particularly in southwestern Canada, because of expanding ungulate populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting. This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada. Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, mostly by poisoning. This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>gray</b> wolf {{was once}} one of the world's most widely {{distributed}} mammals, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15°N latitude in North America and 12°N in India. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the United States. In modern times, <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75°N to 12°N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, because of <b>the</b> <b>gray</b> wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population, it is classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
