25|$|Admiralty Orders of 14 November 1755 {{indicated}} that the Alderney-class vessels were to be built at private dockyards, leaving the Royal Dockyards fully engaged in constructing or fitting-out the larger ships of the line. For previous Navy contracts the prices quoted by Thames River shipyards had proved exorbitant, and the Navy Board had evidence that the shipwrights were colluding to fix higher rates for construction work. In consequence only regional shipwrights were invited to bid for Stork, with the contract awarded on 17 December 1755 to Daniel Stow and Benjamin Bartlett of Shoreham-by-Sea. Contract terms stipulated that the vessel be completed within seven months {{at a cost of}} £7.12s.6d per <b>ton</b> <b>burthen,</b> well below the average rate of £9.0s per ton quoted by Thames River shipyards for Navy vessels of similar size.|$|E

5000|$|Most corvettes and sloops of the 17th {{century were}} around 40 to 60 ft {{in length and}} {{measured}} 40 to 70 <b>tons</b> <b>burthen.</b> They carried four to eight smaller guns on a single deck. Over time, vessels of increasing size and capability were called corvettes; by 1800, they reached lengths of over 100 ft and measured from 400 to 600 <b>tons</b> <b>burthen.</b>|$|R

50|$|Admiralty Orders of 14 November 1755 {{indicated}} that the Alderney-class vessels were to be built at private dockyards, and on 17 December 1755 the contract for Alderney was issued to commercial shipwright John Snooks of Saltash. Contract terms stipulated that the vessel be completed within seven months {{at a cost of}} £7.13s per <b>ton</b> <b>burthen.</b> The new vessel's keel was laid in January 1756 and work commenced on the hull. Bately's initial design was for a two-masted snow-rigged sloop, but this was modified in mid-1756 into a traditional three-masted ship rig to increase speed, though at the expense of manoeuvrability. The half-built sloop was formally christened Alderney on 25 May 1756.|$|E
50|$|Orders from Admiralty {{to build}} the Coventry-class vessels were made after the {{outbreak}} of the Seven Years' War, and at a time in which the Royal Dockyards were fully engaged in constructing or fitting-out the Navy's ships of the line. Consequently, and despite some Navy Board misgivings, contracts for Coventry-class vessels were intended to be issued to private shipyards, with an emphasis on rapid completion of the task. However only one offer was received, from shipwright Thomas Stanton of Rotherhithe, and Admiralty rejected his fee of £9.0 per <b>ton</b> <b>burthen</b> as being too high for a fir-built ship. Instead, Admiralty directed the Navy Board to make room for building Actaeon at Chatham Royal Dockyard, with the work ultimately assigned to Chatham's master shipwright John Lock.|$|E
