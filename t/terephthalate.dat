5|$|Germanium dioxide is {{also used}} in {{catalysts}} for polymerization {{in the production of}} polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET). The high brilliance of this polyester is especially favored for PET bottles marketed in Japan. In the United States, germanium is not used for polymerization catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} is an {{excellent}} polar protic solvent, as noted above. It is frequently used as a solvent for recrystallization to purify organic compounds. Acetic acid {{is used as a}} solvent in the production of terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.|$|E
5|$|Solar water {{disinfection}} (SODIS) involves exposing water-filled plastic polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times {{vary depending on}} weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl <b>terephthalate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Terephthalic acid {{is used as}} a raw {{material}} to make <b>terephthalate</b> plasticizers such as dioctyl <b>terephthalate</b> and dibutyl <b>terephthalate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> can be depolymerized {{to yield}} the {{constituent}} monomers. After purification, the monomers {{can be used}} to prepare new polyethylene <b>terephthalate.</b> The ester bonds in polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> may be cleaved by hydrolysis, or by transesterification. The reactions are simply the reverse of those used in production.|$|E
25|$|Virtually {{the entire}} world's supply of terephthalic acid and {{dimethyl}} <b>terephthalate</b> are consumed as precursors to polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET). World production in 1970 was around 1.75 million tonnes. By 2006, global {{purified terephthalic acid}} (PTA) demand had exceeded 30 million tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (sometimes written poly(ethylene <b>terephthalate)),</b> {{commonly}} abbreviated PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is {{the most}} common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in fibres for clothing, containers for liquids and foods, thermoforming for manufacturing, and in combination with glass fibre for engineering resins.|$|E
25|$|The resin {{identification}} code used in recycling to identify polyethylene <b>terephthalate.</b>|$|E
25|$|For some polymers, it is {{possible}} to convert them back into monomers, for example, PET can be treated with an alcohol and a catalyst to form a dialkyl <b>terephthalate.</b> The <b>terephthalate</b> diester can be used with ethylene glycol to form a new polyester polymer, thus making it possible to use the pure polymer again.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> is {{produced}} from ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate(DMT) (C6H4(CO2CH3)2) or terephthalic acid.|$|E
25|$|Antimony(III) oxide is {{a useful}} {{catalyst}} {{in the production of}} polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET plastic) and the vulcanization of rubber.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is {{marketed as}} various salts, most {{commonly}} as the hydrochloride salt. The free base conversion ratios of different salts are: hydrochloride (0.896), bitartrate (0.667), tartrate (0.750), camphosulphonate (0.576), pectinate (0.588), phenylpriopionate (0.678), sulphate (0.887), phosphate (0.763), and <b>terephthalate</b> (0.792). The hydrochloride salt {{is the basis}} of most American oxycodone products whilst bitartrate, tartrate, pectinate, <b>terephthalate</b> and phosphate salts are also available in European products. Methyiodide and hydroiodide are mentioned in older European publications.|$|E
25|$|There is a smaller, but {{nevertheless}} significant, demand for terephthalic acid {{in the production}} of polybutylene <b>terephthalate</b> and several other engineering polymers.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol is {{primarily}} used in antifreeze formulations (50%) {{and as a}} raw material {{in the manufacture of}} polyesters such as polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET) (40%).|$|E
25|$|Methanolysis is {{only rarely}} {{carried out in}} {{industry}} today because polyester production based on dimethyl terephthalate(DMT) has shrunk tremendously, and many dimethyl <b>terephthalate</b> (DMT) producers have disappeared.|$|E
25|$|In {{the plastic}} industry, {{ethylene}} glycol {{is an important}} precursor to polyester fibers and resins. Polyethylene <b>terephthalate,</b> used to make plastic bottles for soft drinks, is prepared from ethylene glycol.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{modifier}} is isophthalic acid, replacing {{some of the}} 1,4-(para-) linked <b>terephthalate</b> units. The 1,2-(ortho-) or 1,3-(meta-) linkage {{produces an}} angle in the chain, which also disturbs crystallinity.|$|E
25|$|Terylene (a {{trademark}} {{formed by}} inversion of (polyeth)ylene <b>ter(ephthalate))</b> is also spliced into bell rope tops {{to help prevent}} wear on the ropes as they pass through the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|The PTA derivative, {{polyethylene}} <b>terephthalate</b> (PET), {{has become}} the primary container resin for applications such as carbonated beverage bottles, while other polyterephthalates provide dimensional stability, good heat resistance and durability for engineering applications.|$|E
25|$|Germanium dioxide is {{also used}} as a {{catalyst}} in production of polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> resin, and for production of other germanium compounds. It {{is used as a}} feedstock for production of some phosphors and semiconductor materials.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene is {{oxidized}} {{to produce}} ethylene oxide, a {{key raw material}} {{in the production of}} surfactants and detergents by ethoxylation. Ethylene oxide is also hydrolyzed to produce ethylene glycol, widely used as an automotive antifreeze as well as higher molecular weight glycols, glycol ethers and polyethylene <b>terephthalate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depending on its {{processing}} and thermal history, polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> may exist {{both as an}} amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer. The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size less than 500nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few micrometers) depending on its crystal structure and particle size.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET)'s {{discovery}} is credited to {{employees of the}} Calico Printers' Association in the UK in 1941; it was licensed to DuPont for the USA and ICI otherwise, and {{as one of the}} few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances, resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The Cronin–Gerow Implant, {{prosthesis}} model 1963, was a {{silicone rubber}} envelope-sac, {{shaped like a}} teardrop, which was filled with viscous silicone-gel. To reduce {{the rotation of the}} emplaced breast-implant upon the chest wall, the model 1963 prosthesis was affixed to the implant pocket with a fastener-patch, made of Dacron material (Polyethylene <b>terephthalate),</b> which was attached {{to the rear of the}} breast-implant shell.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{polyester}} OH- or COOH- end {{groups are}} transformed into dead or non-reactive end groups, e.g. formation of vinyl ester end groups through dehydration or decarboxylation of <b>terephthalate</b> acid, {{reaction of the}} OH- or COOH- end groups with mono-functional degradation products like mono-carbonic acids or alcohols. Results are decreased reactivity during re-polycondensation or re-SSP and broadening the molecular weight distribution.|$|E

25|$|One main {{disadvantage}} of HA {{is that it}} needs to be covered with exogenous material, such as sclera, polyethylene <b>terephthalate,</b> or vicryl mesh (which has the {{disadvantage of}} creating a rough implant tissue interface that can lead to technical difficulties in implantation and subsequent erosion of overlying tissue with the end stage being extrusion), as direct suturing is not possible for muscle attachment. Scleral covering carries with it the risk of transmission of infection, inﬂammation, and rejection.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde is {{also created}} by thermal {{degradation}} or ultraviolet photo-degradation of some thermoplastic polymers {{during or after}} manufacture. One common example occurs when {{a bottle of water}} is left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day, and one notices its strange sweet taste in the water from the breakdown of the polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PETE) container. The water industry generally recognizes 20–40 ppb as the taste/odor threshold for acetaldehyde. The level at which an average consumer could detect acetaldehyde is still considerably lower than any toxicity.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, 45% of the 250,000 valve {{replacement}} procedures performed annually involve a mechanical valve implant. The {{most widely used}} valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve, or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing {{the flow of blood}} as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon, and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene <b>terephthalate).</b> The mesh allows for the body's tissue to grow while incorporating the valve.|$|E
25|$|Between 1998 and 2003, the canning {{industry}} voluntarily replaced its BPA-containing epoxy resin can liners with BPA-free polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> (PET) {{in many of}} its products. For other products, it switched to a different epoxy lining that yielded much less migration of BPA into food than the previously used resin. In addition, polycarbonate tableware for school lunches was replaced by BPA-free plastics. As {{a result of these}} changes, Japanese risk assessors have found that virtually no BPA is detectable in canned foods or drinks, and blood levels of BPA in the Japanese people have declined up to 50% in one study.|$|E
25|$|At the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson {{discovered}} polyethylene <b>terephthalate,</b> {{known as}} PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and {{also known as}} Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene (the fabric that is now referred to as polyester). ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Sir Michael Perrin.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene <b>Terephthalate</b> Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E
25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept in a barrel or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{modified}} properties of copolymer are more desirable {{for a particular}} application. For example, cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM) {{can be added to}} the polymer backbone in place of ethylene glycol. Since this building block is much larger (6 additional carbon atoms) than the ethylene glycol unit it replaces, it does not fit in with the neighboring chains the way an ethylene glycol unit would. This interferes with crystallization and lowers the polymer's melting temperature. In general, such PET is known as PETG or PET-G (Polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> glycol-modified; Eastman Chemical, SK Chemicals, and Artenius Italia are some PETG manufacturers). PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection molded or sheet extruded. It can be colored during processing.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of Bioreactors {{designed}} for 3D cell cultures. There are small plastic cylindrical chambers, as well as glass chambers, with regulated internal humidity and moisture specifically engineered for the purpose of growing cells in three dimensions. The bioreactor uses bioactive synthetic materials such as polyethylene <b>terephthalate</b> membranes to surround the spheroid cells in an environment that maintains high levels of nutrients. They are easy to open and close, so that cell spheroids can be removed for testing, yet the chamber is able to maintain 100% humidity throughout. This humidity is important to achieve maximum cell growth and function. The bioreactor chamber {{is part of a larger}} device that rotates to ensure equal cell growth in each direction across three dimensions.|$|E
