500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:... Steve Dodds , who is tried for murder and simply says, 'You'd think it would take a good while to make up your mind to kill someone and then to kill them, but <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> it only takes a second'".|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Compose yourself, Clara. I {{have neither}} seen nor heard {{anything}} of Richard Wardour. <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> he is {{far enough away}} by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then don't. <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> sir,--don't." [...] But Mr Whittlestaff only snubbed her, {{and nothing}} more was said about the journey at the moment.|$|E

6000|$|... "What is there? A vast deal too much, sir, <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Do not {{our very}} governors, even while ruthlessly calling on one citizen to murder another----" ...|$|E
