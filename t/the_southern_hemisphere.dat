5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere)</b> to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> {{are more likely to}} migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere,</b> and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere.</b>|$|E

Of the more than 16,000 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in <b>the</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Hemisphere</b> between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in their stomachs, 99.4% fed on euphausiids, 0.5% on fish, and 0.1% on amphipods. In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume E. superba.|$|E
