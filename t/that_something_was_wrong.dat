5|$|The first {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> at Vrbanja Bridge was {{radio silence}} from the French post. About 05:20 on 27 May, platoon commander Captain François Lecointre had lost radio {{contact with the}} posts, {{and drove to the}} bridge {{to find out what was}} happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to Skenderija stadium, the headquarters of FREBAT4.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided {{to remain in the}} vicarage.) Huskisson was moved to the sofa, and given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, at dawn, the Dutch force {{crossed the}} Lippe across a pontoon bridge. Maurice awaited them with 5,000 {{infantry}} {{and the rest}} of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel, along the opposite riverbank. Philip of Nassau divided his troops into four squadrons: the first one of 125 men under the drossaard of Sallandt, the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky, the third one, those in which Nassau and his brothers marched, of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen, and the last, closing the way, of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker. Having arrived at Krudenburg, Nassau sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses. On finding a force much larger than they expected, the Dutch officers thought <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and sent a report back to Philip of Nassau. The Dutch commander, nevertheless, believed that it was only the convoy's escort and moved on with his troops and his entourage to attack the Spanish cavalry, aiming to prevent its escape.|$|E

25|$|Flight 901 was {{supposed}} to arrive back at Christchurch at 6:05pm for a stopover including refuelling and a crew change before completing the journey back to Auckland. Around 50 passengers were also supposed to disembark at Christchurch. Airport staff initially told the waiting families that it was usual for the flight to be slightly late but, as time went on, it became clear <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Estonian {{authorities}} {{refused to}} send the flight data recorder of the helicopter to the United States because the aircraft was manufactured there, thus possibly creating a conflict of interest. The technical investigation was in fact performed in the United Kingdom. The voice recording indicated that the pilots realized <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> only 35 seconds before the helicopter hit the sea, and that they did attempt to send a Mayday message.|$|E
25|$|On 4 September 1815 Quesnel was {{retired from}} the army. In April 1819, he {{suddenly}} disappeared and his corpse was found floating in the Seine in Paris. His watch and a valuable piece of jewelry were found on his body. One source asserted that his death {{could not have been}} a suicide because he was held in high regard in military circles and gave no hint that morning <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> It was suggested that certain individuals threw him off the Pont des Arts (bridge) for political reasons. QUESNEL is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe on the west panel.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Qiu and {{the other}} eunuchs were at the Left Jinwu headquarters. Han, however, had become fearful and was nervous and sweating. Qiu began to sense <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> Suddenly, {{a gust of wind}} blew up a screen, and Qiu saw many armed {{soldiers}} and heard the sounds of clanging weapons. Qiu {{and the other}} eunuchs were surprised and quickly ran outside.

25|$|Despite the minuteness of {{the spatial}} terms, the first {{indications}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier, {{in an analysis}} of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit exhibited an excess rate of precession over that which could be explained by the tugs of the other planets. The ability to detect and accurately measure the minute value of this anomalous precession (only 43 arc seconds per tropical century) is testimony to the sophistication of 19th century astrometry.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> and decided to head to the bridge. However, when he got to the door of his cabin, the combination turned over and he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window. The rising water column carried the chief officer upwards in the staircase until, only seconds from drowning, he arrived at the corridor next to the ship's sauna, which was below the main deck and thus above the surface.|$|E

500|$|During the American Revolutionary War, Spain lent the rebelling colonists {{the use of}} its {{ports in}} Puerto Rico, through which flowed {{financial}} aid and arms for their cause. An incident occurred in the coast of Mayagüez, in 1777, between two Continental Navy ships, the Eudawook and the Henry, and a Royal Navy warship, [...] Both American ships were chased by the larger and more powerful Glasgow. The American colonial ships were close to the coast of Mayagüez; members of the Puerto Rican militia of that town, realizing <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong,</b> signaled for the ships to dock at the town's bay. After the ships docked, the crews of both ships got off and some Mayagüezanos boarded and raised the Spanish flag on both ships. The commander of the Glasgow {{became aware of the}} situation and asked the island's governor, Jose Dufresne to turn over the ships. Dufresne refused and ordered the British warship out of the Puerto Rican dock.|$|E

As Captain Morehouse came on deck, the helmsman reported a vessel about [...] distant, heading unsteadily towards Dei Gratia. The ship's erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong.</b> As the vessels drew close, he could see nobody on deck, and he received no reply to his signals, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship's boat to investigate. From the name on her stern the pair established {{that this was the}} Mary Celeste; they then climbed aboard, where they found the ship deserted. The sails, partly set, were in a poor condition, some missing altogether, and much of the rigging was damaged, with ropes hanging loosely over the sides. The main hatch cover was secure, but the fore and lazarette hatches were open, their covers beside them on the deck. The ship's single lifeboat, a small yawl that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch, was missing, while the binnacle housing the ship's compass had shifted from its place, its glass cover broken.
