40|$|AbstractThe {{expression}} {{describing a}} cross-area linear variation for a tapered beam vibrating axially is considered. It is utilized to formulate the first axial vibration mode shape. The later, {{results from the}} normalization of the displacement function obtained by solving the exact solution of the second order differential equation with none constant coefficients. This function is governing the non uniform bar element equilibrium. After this first step, the well known Rayleigh quotient is used for calculating the fundamental natural frequency. The obtained results are comparable to those issued from numerical and theoretical methods. These findings suggest a simply useable handle tool expressed by a curve which allows a quick fundamental frequency evaluation for various <b>taper</b> <b>degrees...</b>|$|R

Simple analytical expressions for the resonance frequencies {{of the first two}} flexural modes {{as a function of the}} <b>tapering</b> <b>degree</b> are presented. Experimental measurements of the resonance frequencies of singly clamped nanowires are compared with the theory. Our model is valid for any nanostructure with tapered geometry, and it predicts a reduction beyond two orders of magnitude of the mass detection limit for conical resonators as compared to uniform beams with the same length and diameter at the clamp. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

40|$|Abstract. In-stent {{restenosis}} {{still remains}} an obsession to cardiologist, especially in tapered vessels. In this paper, we designed a novel balloon-expandable stent for tapered vessel and proposed a {{finite element method}} (FEM) to study {{the expansion of the}} novel stent. The effect of stent design parameters on stent tapering and foreshortening were also researched. Results show that the radial displacement of stent proximal end was always larger than that of stent distal end during stent expansion, and the stent had a tapered shape as a whole after expansion. The <b>degree</b> of stent <b>tapering</b> observed increased with the expansion pressure increase. Besides, increasing the gradient of ring amplitude not only could increase the <b>tapering</b> <b>degree</b> of stent after expansion, but also could decrease stent foreshortening, improving the positioning accuracy after stent implantation. In conclusion, FEM can quantify expansion performance of novel balloon-expandable stents and help designers to devise and assess new stent designs for tapered vessel...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to design a new device {{assisting}} dental students to measure the tapering of the prepared teeth for fixed crown prosthesis in which the desired tapering for better clinical prognosis could be obtained. Materials and Methods: The designed device in this study had two arms that were placed on two opposite walls of the prepared teeth. To evaluate the validity and reliability of this device, 3 dies with different degrees (13, 29 and 45 °) were used and 20 teeth were prepared by dental students with undefined <b>tapering</b> <b>degrees.</b> The measurements of tapering were performed by six last year-dental students in two different time periods. Comparison of errors in measurements on standard dies between observers and between time intervals were analyzed by (Wilcoxon) Paired t-test with a significance level of α= 0. 05. Results: For the three dies used in this study, we compared the differences for each measurement taken by observers with the standard taper of the dies. Maximum difference of measurements with true standard die <b>tapering</b> was 1 <b>degree.</b> A number of 6 measurements were under the true standard tapers and 2 measurements were above it. Interclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) of the first and second measurements on prepared teeth were 97. 4 and 97. 5, respectively. There were no significant differences between different observers or two measurements of the same observer in different time intervals (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: The results indicated that this device can be valid and reliable for measuring the angle of convergence of the prepared teeth and can be used as an educational device in dental schools as a replacement for previous tapering measurement methods...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the retentive strength of single-unit crowns with 10 degrees and 26 <b>degrees</b> <b>taper</b> angles cemented using two surface conditioning methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two freshly extracted sound human molars were divided into two groups (n = 16) and prepared in a standardized manner with 10 degrees and 26 <b>degrees</b> <b>taper</b> angles. All-ceramic (IPS e. max Press) single crowns were fabricated for the prepared teeth. The crowns were then subdivided into two groups (n = 8), according to type of surface conditioning for the intaglio surfaces. Half the groups were HF acid etched and silanized, and the other half were conditioned with tribochemical silica coating and silanization. The crowns were cemented using adhesive cement (Panavia F 2. 0). Retentive strength was measured in a universal testing machine. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the mean retention forces for both 10 degrees and 26 <b>degrees</b> <b>taper</b> angles when the crowns were conditioned either with silica coating (613 +/- 190 N and 525 +/- 90 N, respectively), or with hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching and silanization (550 +/- 110 N and 490 +/- 130 N for 10 degrees and 26 degrees, respectively) (p= 0. 32). CONCLUSION: Neither the surface conditioning type, nor the taper angle affected the retentive strength of IPS e. max Press single-unit crowns when cemented adhesively. Since silica coating and silanization did not show significant differences from HF acid gel and silanization, the former can be preferred for conditioning intaglio surfaces of glass ceramic crowns to avoid the use of the hazardous compound HF acid gel chairside...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{data from}} seven superconducting {{gravimeter}} (SG) stations in Europe from 2002 to 2007 from the Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) and compare seasonal variations {{with data from}} GRACE and several global hydrological models—GLDAS, WGHM and ERA-Interim. Our technique is empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of the fields that allows for the inherent incompatibility of length scales between ground and satellite observations. GGP stations below the ground surface pose a problem because part of the attraction from soil moisture comes from above the gravimeter, and this {{gives rise to a}} complex (mixed) gravity response. The first principle component (PC) of the EOF decomposition is the main indicator for comparing the fields, although for some of the series it accounts for only about 50 per cent of the variance reduction. PCs for GRACE solutions RL 04 from CSR and GFZ are filtered with a cosine <b>taper</b> (<b>degrees</b> 20 – 40) and a Gaussian window (350 km). Significant differences are evident between GRACE solutions from different groups and filters, though they all agree reasonably well with the global hydrological models for the predominantly seasonal signal. We estimate the first PC at 10 -d sampling to be accurate to 1 μGal for GGP data, 1. 5 μGal for GRACE data and 1 μGal between the three global hydrological models. Within these limits the CNES/GRGS solution and ground GGP data agree at the 79 per cent level, and better when the GGP solution is restricted to the three above-ground stations. The major limitation on the GGP side comes from the water mass distribution surrounding the underground instruments that leads to a complex gravity effect. To solve this we propose a method for correcting the SG residual gravity series for the effects of soil moisture above the station...|$|R

The main function of this developed blank holding device is adopting the frictional force between the blank and the blank holder to work in the useful drawing direction likewise the function of the rubber ring used in Maslennikov's process. Drawing deformation is efficiently performed by using an assistant metal punch, which is supplemented with a hydraulic cylinder to provide a constant punch force during the drawing process. The drawing mechanism and the effects of drawing conditions are mainly investigated to characterize the merits and defects of the proposed process. Since successful deep cups of drawing ratio 3. 76 have been produced the possibility of the present technique is already confirmed, however, further investigations are needed to enhance the drawing efficiency.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{finite element}} models of an upper second premolar and molar with full veneer gold crown preparations were developed from extracted samples. The cement lute width was kept constant at 40 microm, but the height and preparation taper were varied. For both models the preparation height was either 1. 5 mm (short preparation) or 3 mm (long preparation). The preparation taper was either 10 degree or 30 degree, giving a total of eight models. Each model was loaded with a 10 N horizontal load, a 10 N vertical load or a 10 N load distributed across the occlusal surface. The maximum shear stress and the maximum Von Mises' stress in the cement lute of each model were recorded. For the premolar, the maximum shear stresses ranged from 0. 3 - 5. 43 MPa and the maximum Von Mises' stress ranged from 1. 44 - 14. 98 MPa.

Methods: Twenty implants (3. 75 mm x 15 mm) were connected to non-matching abutments (5. 5 mm x 10 mm) of two different materials (titanium grade- 4 : n = 10; Co-Cr-alloy: n = 10). The specimens were separately embedded in epoxylite resin, inside copper cylinders, and submerged without covering the most coronal portion (5 mm) of the fixture. Five specimens per group were stressed simulating a surgical 100 Ncm insertion torque, while the others had no torque simulation. All specimens were subjected to a non-axial static load (100 N) in a universal testing machine, under an angle of 30 degrees {{with respect to the}} implant axis. Once 100 N load was reached, low shrinkage self-curing resin was injected inside the cylinders, and load was maintained until complete resin polymerization. Specimens were cut and analyzed with optical and scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) to {{evaluate the}} marginal adaptation at the implant-abutment connection.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} first {{experimental}} observation of surface Brillouin scattering in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) arising from interaction between light and {{surface acoustic waves}} (SAWs). We also show that this new type of light scattering is highly sensitive to the PCF air-hole microstructure, thus providing a passive and efficient way to control it. Our observations are confirmed through numerical simulations of the elastodynamics equation. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) in conventional optical fibers has extensively been investigated {{over the past years}} with many applications ranging from optical telecommunications to sensing [1]. Although it is well known, recent works have shown that using micro and nanoscale waveguides offers the possibility to go towards new forms of BLS [2, 3]. For instance, it has recently been shown that a light beam passing through a silica microfiber can generate and interact with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) [2]. This interaction gives rise to a new type of backward BLS with new frequency shifts that relies on the surface Rayleigh velocity (~ 3400 m. s- 1 for silica). This effect is absent in conventional fibers because of their large core and the weak difference of acoustic index between the core and the cladding. Here we show that small-core PCFs offer a new way to investigate and control this new type of BLS, with the advantages of longer length than fiber <b>taper</b> and more <b>degrees</b> of freedom such as the air-filling fraction. Figure 1 shows the experimental Brillouin spectra measured in two different core-size silica PCFs shown in insets. In both cases, we can clearly see 3 main peaks around 6 GHz as the result of SAW-induced BLS. A further comparison of the two spectra shows a clear rightward shift of the Brillouin peaks due to the effective refractive index increase with the core size, while the amplitude difference comes from the microstructure irregularities. These observations indicate that one can finely control the properties of surface Brillouin scattering by tailoring the fiber air-hole microstructure.

40|$|Lecturepg. 3 Many {{facilities}} do {{not obtain}} the expected {{life out of}} ANSI and other centrifugal pumps, seals, and bearings {{that need to be}} obtained to be competitive in today?s market place. The analysis of this situation leads to two industry wide flaws. The first problem {{is that many of the}} pumps were never initially installed correctly. This shortcut on the initial installation leads to a lifetime of high and unnecessary maintenance costs, along with the process leaks, excess emissions, and wasted man-hours spent on fighting a losing battle. And a lifetime is accurate, as some centrifugal pumps have been in service for over 33 years. Once a pump is misinstalled, it is very difficult to get approval to spend the time, effort, and dollars to reinstall a pump that is already operating, albeit at a high maintenance cost. Production will most always take precedence. With typical chemical plants operating over 330 days a year, time is limited for such ?unimportant? projects as pump reinstallation. This is why correctly installing an ANSI, or any pump, initially is so critical to trouble free operation. The second flaw is that many of the mechanical seals are operating in stuffing boxes designed for packing. The new technology in current ANSI pumps designed to operate using mechanical seals is worth the conversion cost. End users need to know the benefits of the new seal chambers on the market. It is documented that converting to the four <b>degree</b> <b>taper</b> seal chamber alone has increased seal life three fold on specific applications. Enacting a solution to poor pump installations is a long and tedious mission, but one that can be accomplished. It does require using sound engineering principals to justify the costs needed to remedy the problem. A user might need to test principles that other end users already take for common practice. The twelve steps that were used to justify the reinstallation and upgrading of current problem pumps are reviewed herein. Several of the steps are worked on simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|For {{photovoltaics}} {{to achieve}} wide-scale implementation {{it is essential}} that their cost is reduced while maintaining or exceeding the present level of solar to electrical conversion performance. Concentrating solar energy onto a photovoltaic cell allows a reduction in the output electricity cost, if the cost of the concentrator is less than that of the displaced photovoltaic materials. Photovoltaic cell efficiency is shown to decrease with increasing temperature, causing the photovoltaic cells to exhibit both short-term (efficiency loss) and long term (irreversible damage) degradation due to excessive temperatures. Hence the analysis of thermal management is an important issue in photovoltaic power generating systems for both one-sun (lx) and concentrated applications. This thesis presents an experimental and numerical study of solar cell temperature in a midconcentration silicon photovoltaic concentrator (CPV), with a geometric concentration ratio of 42 X. Experimental and computational fluid dynamic (CFO) modelling of heat transfer in six designs of CPV device is carried out. A detailed experimental study was designed and carried out in order to investigate the temperature and initial boundary conditions of the two initial CPV prototypes, with a without passive cooling arrangements, operating under standard test conditions (STC) in conjunction with the effect of environmental variables, namely the irradiance incident on the plane-of-array of the CPV module, the local wind speed and the ambient temperature on the operating temperatures of the CPV prototypes. The operating temperature is shown to depend strongly on the irradiance, less so on the wind speed and is found to be insensitive to short term fluctuations in ambient temperature. Temperature profiles of the CPV prototypes were measured experimentally with thermocouples placed both internally and externally along the enclosure and walls aJong the length of each CPV module. To investigate the performance of the CPV devices under a fixed set of repeatable environmental conditions, a solar simulator was designed and built to facilitate indoor testing at a range of illumination levels (0 to 1000 W 1 m 2) and environmental conditions. Reviewing the results {{it was found that the}} spectrum and uniformity of irradiance source incident the plane of a single module (1 x 0. lm) is of great importance. The solar simulator was also found to artificially increase the module operating temperature, with greater temperatures recorded during indoor testing. Wind speed and direction measurements were taken in order to establish the module convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) which was determined to relatively insensitive to wind direction and to be a power law function of the mean wind speed. In the second phase of the work, three dimensional numerical studies of the photovoltaic concentrator prototypes were developed using ANSYS Fluent Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software to solve the mass, momentum and energy transfer governing equations. The simulations provided thermal and dynamic maps of the fluid flow and the heat transfer between the cell and the passive cooling systems. The results show that a maximum of seven radial fins (CPV design 3) of 27 mm height, 3. 3 mm thickness with a 4 <b>degree</b> <b>taper</b> can be effectively used to reduce the solar cell temperature, from 97. 8 "C with no cooling fins to 67. 7 "C with seven fins, measured at nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) conditions. In addition. to validate the model. experimental measurements of temperature and flow characteristics are compared with experimental data. Numerical results of the CPV operating temperature are shown to have a strong correlation with experimental data with a maximum 0. 3 % deviation from experimental data for prototype one and a maximum 1. 5 % deviation from experimental data for prototype two. Simulation models are shown to be important design tools for predicting a photovoltaic concentrator's experimental and real world performance. Informed design decision making and optimisation is a significant goal of this work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
