5|$|The Imme R100's light weight, {{relatively}} powerful engine, {{and long}} travel suspension made it popular in motorsport; this, along with good marketing and low pricing, led to strong sales. The management of Riedel AG expected high sales volume {{to offset the}} low profit margin. A basic Imme sold for 775 Deutschmark without battery, <b>tachometer,</b> or centre stand. Passenger accommodation was an optional extra, as was a spare wheel. Initially, Immes were all painted oxide red.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and <b>tachometer.</b> The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
25|$|Enhancements to the {{instrument}} panel include white illumination for the vehicle information display and instrument indicator, as well as standardized lettering for speedometer and <b>tachometer.</b>|$|E

50|$|On January 29, 1988, Motorola {{sold its}} Arcade, New York {{facility}} and automotive alternators, electromechanical speedometers and <b>tachometers</b> products to Prestolite Electric.|$|R
25|$|In {{the vehicle}} {{instrument}} display, between {{the speedometer and}} <b>tachometer,</b> the available shift-lever positions are shown, the current position of the shift-lever is highlighted (emboldened), and the current gear ratio in use is also displayed as a number.|$|E
25|$|The {{controls}} of the Tg500 {{were similar to}} those of the KR200 except for the Tg500's single starting mode for the engine and its H-pattern gearshift with reverse gear and no auxiliary lever. A <b>tachometer</b> was offered as an optional replacement for the clock.|$|E
25|$|The cabin has a {{head up display}} (HUD) {{which is}} {{projected}} on to a clear panel raised in {{the centre of the}} dash. It shows information that would usually appear on dashboard instruments, including the <b>tachometer</b> and speedometer. Also projected is a digital image of Maserati's traditional analogue clock.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Retro¯tting of an {{industrial}} robot consists on verifying the usability conditions of each {{component of the}} robot, replacing obsolete ones, especially electronics and control. This work describes {{the replacement of the}} analog sensors (resolvers and <b>tachometers)</b> of a retro¯tted ASEA IRB 6 robot by digital sensors (incremental optical encoders). The advantages of such replacements are assessed through the use of <b>tachometers</b> and encoders for speed feedback. The control architecture based on a CAN-bus is also presented.

50|$|Brown Instrument Company was a U.S. firm {{known for}} {{high-quality}} instruments (such as pyrometers, thermometers, hygrometers, <b>tachometers,</b> pressure gauges, flow meters, ammeters, and voltmeters) and industrial controls.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tachometers</b> are {{acceptable}} for high-fidelity sound playback, {{but not for}} recording in synchronization with a movie camera. For such purposes, special recorders that record pilottone must be used.|$|R
25|$|There is an {{established}} pit road speed limit for each race. Since NASCAR cars {{do not have}} speedometers, the first pace lap of each race is run at pit road speed so drivers can get a <b>tachometer</b> reading for pit speed. There {{are a variety of}} other safety rules (see penalties above) that must be followed.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, the GSX {{option was}} {{available}} in only two colors, Saturn Yellow and Apollo White (in 1971 and 1972 6 other colors were available for the GSX). Came with only full black interior. All GSXs had the distinctive full body length black stripe that crossed over the standard equipment rear spoiler and was outlined in red pin stripes. A large area of the hood was also black with a hood mounted <b>tachometer</b> (Buick engineers disliked the hood <b>tachometer</b> {{because it was a}} Pontiac part) and black front spoiler. Also standard equipment were black bucket seats, floor shifter, wide oval tires, quick ratio steering and anti-sway bars front and rear and quad-link suspension attached to a limited-slip rear differential. Some other options were automatic transmission or four speed manual, A/C or Non-A/C. Restored matching numbers versions have sold in Barrett-Jackson's and Mecum auctions for as much as $170,000.|$|E
25|$|G.T.350 was {{available}} with {{air conditioning and}} an AM/FM radio. The steering wheel was a wood-rimmed and satin-trimmed design with the classic Shelby logo in the center. Behind this wheel was a very classy-looking set of gauges. A 140-mph speedometer and a whopping 8,000-rpm <b>tachometer</b> were joined with smaller analog clock, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure gauges.|$|E
5000|$|Speed sensing devices, termed {{variously}} [...] "wheel impulse generators" [...] (WIG), speed probes, or <b>tachometers</b> {{are used}} extensively in rail vehicles. Common types include opto-isolator slotted disk sensors and Hall effect sensors.|$|R
50|$|The Sabres, {{especially}} the V45, were technology showcases for Honda. Not {{only did they}} feature revolutionary water-cooled, DOHC, 90-degree-V four-cylinder engines, but they also featured hydraulically actuated, one-way clutches, TRAC anti-dive front suspension, Pro-link rear suspensions, and electronic speedometers and <b>tachometers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tachometers</b> or {{revolution}} counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show {{the rate of}} rotation of the engine's crankshaft, and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds. This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate lubrication, overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. This is more applicable to manual transmissions than to automatics. On analogue <b>tachometers,</b> speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by {{an area of the}} gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of [...] "redlining" [...] an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern cars, since their engines typically have a revolution limiter which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. Diesel engines with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral governor which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the <b>tachometers</b> in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a redline.|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} of the new Insight includes {{a variation of the}} two-tier instrument panel first introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic. In this arrangement, a digital speedometer is mounted high on the instrument panel within the driver’s normal line-of-sight for ease of visibility. An analog <b>tachometer,</b> fuel gauge, hybrid assist gauge, and Multi-Information Display are housed in the lower tier.|$|E
25|$|Common {{equipment}} includes {{tilt steering}} column, six-way adjustable driver seat, rear-window defroster, remote fuel {{door and a}} 60/40 split-bench folding rear seat. The instrument panel includes a <b>tachometer,</b> speedometer, odometer, trip odometer, fuel gauge, coolant temperature gauge and lighting dimmer control. The IP also has a center storage tray, lighter, extra 12-volt outlet, digital quartz clock and lighted glove box.|$|E
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a <b>tachometer</b> in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the clutch lever. This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to GS and LS trims, {{there was also}} a Trio appearance package offered from model year 1997 until 1999 on the GS. The LS trim featured <b>tachometers</b> and alloy wheels along with optional leather interior, key-less entry and power windows and door locks.|$|R
5000|$|Grand Extra (SGX/KF42 & LGX/KF52): top of {{the range}} model with double blower AC, alloy wheels, suede-covered door trim and seats, power steering, power mirror, power windows, <b>tachometers,</b> {{upgraded}} audio system with tape deck and radio receiver (CD player available as optional), alarms and power locks.|$|R
50|$|Some optocouplers have a {{reflective}} pair configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers that contain a source that emits {{light and a}} sensor that only detects light when it has reflected off an object. The reflective pair configuration is suitable {{for the development of}} <b>tachometers,</b> movement detectors and reflectance monitors.|$|R
25|$|At Earls Court, London, in 1976, Batavus {{showed the}} seven-model range; six {{machines}} were {{powered by the}} 48cc Laura engine, with V-belt primary drive and automatic clutch. The exception was the top-of-the-range Mk 4S, with motorcycle styling and the Sachs four-speed motor. Specification include an electronic <b>tachometer,</b> battery-operated turn signals and heavy-duty suspension front and rear. This model, which has the overall dimensions of a full-sized motorcycle was the biggest machine sold by Batavus.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as Toyota's Camry upgrade in April 1994, Apollo {{specifications}} were also uprated slightly. SLXs now had a four- and GSs a six-speaker stereo system, up from two and four, respectively. The SLX also received a <b>tachometer</b> and rear mudflaps, while the GS variant gained standard fitment cruise control and power windows. A second update in June 1994 fitted a driver's airbag as standard on all models bar the four-cylinder SLX.|$|E
25|$|In {{operation}} the TFT display shows small digits in automatic mode; {{larger and}} bolder numbers in normal mode; inverted colors, moved redline, and stark numbers in sport mode, {{along with a}} programmable redline warning color change. The <b>tachometer</b> display also features an electric movable metal ring with layer acrylic plastic to create a 3D effect. The LFA further features a new driver and passenger seat-belt airbag design increases similar to the S-Class ESF safety concept car.|$|E

25|$|As an option, {{an active}} limited slip {{differential}} was available instead of the standard viscous LSD. This new unit locked the rear differential if it detected that traction was lost {{by one of the}} wheels. A light on the dash also lit up if the LSD engaged. Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD and SLIP lights on the <b>tachometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Available {{only as a}} two-door hardtop, the {{interior}} came in standard gray charcoal vinyl upholstered reclining seats with a headliner embossed with small squares. The front seats reclined, and the newly safety mandated head restraints were upholstered in red, white, and blue stripes. The SC/Rambler included a standard 90-degree wide arc scale Sun <b>tachometer.</b> It {{was attached to the}} right side or top of the steering column with a stainless hose clamp. The only factory option was an AM radio.|$|E
25|$|Two {{sedan and}} wagon body styles were {{available}} in two trims {{for the duration of}} the Medallion's run. The base models came in DL trim, while the up-level LX models featured more standard features. Standard equipment on all Medallions included a <b>tachometer,</b> digital clock, AM/FM stereo, tinted glass, tilt steering wheel, power steering and brakes, as well as a driver's seat-height adjuster for the reclining front seats. The station wagon also included a locking storage bin, as well as adjustable roof rack and a rear-window wiper.|$|E
40|$|An {{automobile}} and a tracked military vehicle were instrumented with multiple <b>tachometers,</b> {{one for each}} drive wheel/sprocket and operated with accelerometers mounted at suspension, chassis, and powertrain locations on the vehicles. The TVDFT order tracking method was then used to extract the order tracks {{from each of the}} wheels/sprockets and operating shapes estimated based on the order tracks. It is shown that under some conditions a different operating shape is excited by each of the wheels/sprockets simultaneously. This is due to the asymmetries present in the vehicles. The strengths of the TVDFT order tracking method are also shown for this type of analysis which is difficult due to the closeness and crossing of the orders generated by each of the wheels. Benefits of using multiple <b>tachometers</b> and advanced order tracking methods becomes apparent for solving certain types of noise and vibration problems...|$|R
