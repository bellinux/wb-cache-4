The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate to what extent <b>the</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>show</b> familial aggregation. Symptom ratings were made using the SAPS and SANS and the OPCRIT checklist on the members of 109 sibling pairs with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Factor analyses were performed on the ratings of both instruments, and correlations were made of within-pair factor scores. Analyses were also performed on the 89 pairs in which both members had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Factor analysis of SAPS and SANS ratings resulted in positive, negative, and disorganization factors; analysis of OPCRIT ratings resulted in positive, negative, disorganization, and first-rank delusion factors.

This movie reveals a discourse on both violence and women’s resistance against it. <b>The</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>shown</b> included psychological, physical, and sexual violence between parents and their child, an adult men with his daughter, and adult men with adult women. Violence appears because of the unbalanced relationship between subject and object. The effects of this violence can {{take the form of}} fear, anger, or a feeling of inferiority and unworthiness, and the victim feels encouraged to act on it. Discourse related to gender-based violence is a result of a patriarchal cultural construction. In the film, resistance was portrayed through the victim’s suffering, anger, and physical resistance. Women directors perceived these issues from a different perspective. It is not enough to understand violence against women only from the normative perspective of law and social obligation. This issue must be understood by positioning women as the subject (survivor) and recognizing that violence against women is a crime against humanity...|$|E

40|$|Biochemical {{analysis}} for medical diagnostics is normally {{carried out by}} trained operators in sophisticated laboratories using large instruments. These techniques are out of reach to many people living in remote areas or are too slow for critically ill patients who need urgent care. A rapid, automated, compact, low cost and disposable integrated lab on a chip device which can be operated by a minimally trained person is required {{not only for the}} detection and diagnosis of the diseases, but also for water, food and environmental safety. Optical waveguide devices allow integration of various optoelectronic and microfluidic components to help in realizing sensing of liquid analytes and require 3 - 6 orders less sample volume compared with many conventional medical tests. The mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral window covering wavelengths from 2 to 14 µm is ideal for biochemical analysis due to the fundamental fingerprint molecular absorption, and waveguide evanescent field based spectroscopy can potentially offer rapid high sensitivity, real-time measurement of complex mixtures to identify and quantify species in clinical samples for point of care diagnosis without any biomarkers. To realize such devices, mid-IR transparent chalcogenide materials are used to fabricate optical waveguides. In our previous work, we have demonstrated waveguiding in the mid-IR region using germanium telluride (GeTe 4) waveguide cores on zinc selenide (ZnSe) substrates [1]. In this work, ZnSe rib waveguides were fabricated on oxidized silicon with <b>the</b> <b>dimensions</b> <b>shown</b> in Fig 1 (a). ZnSe films were deposited by thermal evaporation and the ribs were fabricated using photolithography and Ar + ion-beam etching. Light from a tunable optical parametric oscillator (M-squared) operating between 2. 5 - 3. 7 µm wavelengths was butt-coupled into the waveguide using a single mode ZrF 4 fibre (core diameter ~ 9 µm) and the waveguide output was collected using a multimode InF 3 fibre (core diameter ~ 100 µm), directed onto a TE cooled Mercury Cadmium Telluride detector (MCT, Vigo System) and recorded on a computer. After optimizing coupling into the waveguide by imaging the waveguide output using a mid-IR camera from above, as shown in Fig 1 (b), two spectral scans were recorded, one of the output power from the waveguide alone and the other with a 10 µL DI water droplet on the waveguide surface of length ~ 0. 6 cm shown in Fig 1 (c) inset. The ratio, representing the waveguide absorption spectrum of water, is plotted in Fig 1 (c) (black points) and compared with a numerical model of the water-coated waveguide (blue line) using the published complex refractive index of water [2], for a waveguide length of 0. 6 cm. These preliminary experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical results. The elevated transmission in the absorption band is due to substrate radiation and the transmission above unity is due to reduction in waveguide scattering loss with the water cladding. Future work will study the absorption spectra of clinically relevant analytes.
