25|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Putney has been one of the most {{significant}} centres for <b>rowing</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom.</b> There were two historic reasons for this.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the history}} of the WPSF, the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> has been the most successful, winning the [...] "WPSF Grand Prix" [...] 5 times in the seventies (even three times in <b>row).</b> The <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> is {{followed}} by the United States with 4 Grand Prix victories. Smaller countries won as well: Jamaica in 1972 with Ernie Smith, Norway in 1974 with Ellen Nikolaysen, Cuba in 1981 with Osvaldo Rodríguez and Hungary in 1983 with Neoton Família.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and his father Hugh <b>rowed</b> for the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze medal in the eight-oared race. Porter began his rowing career {{in his second year}} at the University of Victoria.|$|R
50|$|Iffley Road used to {{be known}} as the Henley Road in the 19th century since it leads towards Henley-on-Thames, the {{historic}} centre of the sport of <b>rowing</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom,</b> with its famous Henley Royal Regatta further down the River Thames. Now only the few hundred metres before Rose Hill carry any mention of Henley, as Henley Avenue.|$|R
50|$|The Thames is the {{historic}} heartland of <b>rowing</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom.</b> There are over 200 clubs on the river, and over 8,000 members of British Rowing (over 40% of its membership). Most towns and districts {{of any size}} on the river {{have at least one}} club. Internationally attended centres are Oxford, Henley-on-Thames and events and clubs on the stretch of river from Chiswick to Putney.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, at {{the start}} of the Second Chechen War, Zhirinovsky, an ardent {{supporter}} of the first war in Chechnya in the mid-1990s, advocated hitting some Chechen villages with tactical nuclear weapons. He has also advocated using nuclear weapons and naval blockade-imposed starvation in the event of a Russian war against Japan. In 2008, during the resulting political <b>row</b> between the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> and Russia, he suggested dropping nuclear bombs over the Atlantic Ocean in an effort to flood Britain.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} celebrated of Brasenose College oarsmen was the larger than life Walter Bradford Woodgate, who once wagered he could walk the fifty-seven miles from Stones Chop House in London's Panton Street (near Leicester Square) to Brasenose in time for breakfast. The leading oarsman of his age, he won eleven Henley titles in the 1860s, {{including}} three in two days in 1862, when he narrowly missed a fourth victory after dead-heating the final of the Diamonds. Along with Edwin Brickwood, {{he was one of the}} earliest chroniclers of <b>rowing</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lunn-Rockliffe was Executive Secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association (now {{known as}} British <b>Rowing)</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> from 1976 until 1987, {{overseeing}} the move towards a more professional organization. He was then {{central to the}} foundation of the River and Rowing Museum in Henley, opened by Queen Elizabeth II in November 1998. He took charge of negotiating a site close to the River Thames with Henley Town Council, engaging the architect David Chipperfield to design the award-winning museum building, and obtaining planning permission together with major sponsorship from the locally based businessmen Martyn Arbib and Urs Schwarzenbach.|$|R
5000|$|However, in October 2011, a <b>row</b> {{between the}} <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> and its fellow EU members reached a head as the UK had blocked more than 70 EU {{statements}} to UN committees. The row {{was over the}} wording used; the statements read they were {{on behalf of the}} EU, rather than [...] "EU and its member states" [...] as the UK insisted. The UK's actions were intended to stop the perceived drift towards a common EU foreign policy and were insisted upon by British Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague. While purely symbolic, the issue has become a big deal for both sides, although the UK government has been criticised for using valuable political capital and good will on something that will yield, even if successful, no real gain.|$|R
5000|$|University <b>rowing</b> in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> {{began when}} it was {{introduced}} to Oxford in the late 18th century. [...] The first known race at a university took place at Oxford in 1815 between Brasenose and Jesus and the first inter-university boat race, between Oxford and Cambridge, was rowed on 10 June 1829. [...] Today, many universities have a boat club and at some collegiate universities—Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, and London—each college has its own club {{as well as a}} main university club. In contrast to the Oxford/Cambridge/Durham colleges, London colleges are members of British Universities and Colleges Sport in their own right, and thus compete in inter-university competitions. In Scotland, the rowing clubs of Glasgow University and Edinburgh University initiated an annual race in 1877, making this competition the second oldest in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom.</b> Competitive university <b>rowing</b> in Northern Ireland began in the 1930s with the formation of Queen's University Belfast Boat Club in 1931, whose first inter-varsity races were a triangular tournament against Glasgow and UCD in 1934-35 and who entered the Wylie Cup (which had been running between Irish universities since 1922) from 1937-38; the Welsh Boat Race began in 2006.|$|R
