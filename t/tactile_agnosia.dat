50|$|While astereogonsis is {{characterized}} by the lack of tactile recognition in both hands, it seems to be closely related to <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> (impairment connected to one hand). <b>Tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> observations are rare and case-specific. Josef Gerstmann recounts his experience with patient JH, a 34-year-old infantryman who suffered a lesion to the posterior parietal lobe due to a gunshot. Following the injury, JH was unable to recognize or identify everyday objects by their meaning, origin, purpose and use with his left hand using tactile sensation alone. His motility performance, elementary sensitivity, and speech were intact, and he lacked abnormalities in brain nerves.|$|E

40|$|Introduction				 						 Body {{representation}} {{is a form}} of higher order somatosensory functioning containing multiple integrative processes in which information from different primary sensory modalities is integrated in a representation of the body. It is crucial for the conscious experience of the position and structure of our body parts and directing bodily movements. Disorders of body representation can affect the entire body or only specific body parts. The exact neurological substrate underlying body representation disorders remains unclear. The aim of the current study is to determine the neural substrate of body representation. Methodology											 In the present study we investigate in the neurological mechanisms underlying body representation-disorders in a sample of 17 first episode-stroke patients by linking neurological lesions with body representation disorders, i. e. finger <b>agnosia,</b> <b>tactile</b> localization impairments or left-right disorientation. Furthermore, the overlap and interplay between these impairments are mapped by using an advanced voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach. Results											 The voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis of the anatomical correlate related to left right disorientation showed that lesions significantly related to left right disorientation are mainly located in the right hemisphere, more specifically the nucleus caudatus, capsula externa and putamen. Analyses on finger <b>agnosia</b> and <b>tactile</b> localization impairments gained no significant results, but a qualitative lesion subtraction analysis shows a trend that lesions related to these disorders are also mainly situated in the right hemisphere, more specifically the caudate nucleus, external capsule, putamen and frontal cortex. Conclusions 										 These results indicate that parts of the basal ganglia and the external capsule of the right hemisphere are key anatomical structures in body representatio...|$|R
50|$|Individuals with <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{may be able}} to {{identify}} the name, purpose, or origin of an object with their left hand but not their right, or vice versa, or both hands. Astereognosis refers specifically to those who lack tactile recognition in both hands. In the affected hand(s) they may be able {{to identify}} basic shapes such as pyramids and spheres (with abnormally high difficulty) but still not tactilely recognize common objects by easily recognizable and unique features such as a fork by its prongs (though the individual may report feeling a long, metal rod with multiple, pointy rods stemming off in uniform direction). These symptoms suggest that a very specific part of the brain is responsible for making the connections between tactile stimuli and functions/relationships of that stimuli, which, along with the relatively low impact this disorder has on a person's quality of life, helps explain the rarity of reports and research of individuals with <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Astereognosis (or <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> if {{only one}} hand is affected) is the {{inability}} to identify an object by active touch of the hands without other sensory input, such as visual or sensory information. An individual with astereognosis is unable to identify objects by handling them, despite intact elementary tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal sensation. With the absence of vision (i.e. eyes closed), an individual with astereognosis is unable to identify what is placed in their hand based on cues such as texture, size, spatial properties, and temperature. As opposed to agnosia, when the object is observed visually, one {{should be able to}} successfully identify the object.|$|E
50|$|Head and Holme's studies (1911) were {{developed}} alongside those of Arnold Pick (1851-1924), {{who was the}} first to describe autotopagnosia (1908) as the inability to locate body parts on command on a whole body structure.Pick noted those afflicted with autotopagnosia as having a dissociation between the capacity to recognize and name their own body part (as commanded by an examiner) and the inability to find the same body part on command. In a series of studies, Pick focused on patients who were unable to point to their own body parts and those of the examiner. His patients could however comprehend the body part terminology as well as locate them on a painted visual; however none had a clear demonstration of body specificity. Pick concluded a disturbance of “visual” body image and body awareness. Pick’s studies introduced autotopagnosia and other category specific agnosias, such as visual and <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Josef Gerstmann (1887-1969) first developed the term somatotopagnosia, meaning the lack of knowledge about the body space. Gerstmann studied patients whose deficits were in the body schema and thus lacked the ability to recognize, identify or name the fingers on either hand, a phenomenon known as finger agnosia. This particular ailment, known as Gerstmann syndrome, is often seen in patients with a lesion on their left angular gyrus, which is known to be frequently anatomically correlated with autotopagnosia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is a rare}} {{syndrome}} occurring after parietal {{damages and}} characterized by inability to recognize objects on tactile exploration (Bauer, 1993). Due to a stroke in right parietal lobe, US complained left unimanual <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia.</b> Cognitive and sensory functions were completely preserved. This study aimed to investigate whether an off-line program of anodical tDCS stimulation may influence the patient’s performance. Sessions of 5 days of stimulation (A) and 5 days of non-stimulation (B) were alternated and repeated three times. Two sites of stimulation (20 minutes at 2 mA) were counterbalanced every day (2 hours of interval) : the perilesional parietal area (P 4 – specific stimulation) and the occipital lobe (0 z- 02 - not specific stimulation). These results indicate that specific a-tDCS stimulation may support rehabilitation programs of behavioural exercise...|$|E
40|$|A 54 -year-old female showed amorphagnosia without ahylognosia and <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> 40 {{days after}} the onset of right {{cerebral}} infarction. Her basic somatosensory functions were normal. The appreciation of substance qualities (hylognosia) was preserved, but the patient’s inability to recognize {{the size and shape}} (morphagnosia) was confined to 2 - and 3 -dimensional shapes (amorphagnosia) in the left hand. However, the patient’s ability to recognize real daily objects was well preserved. Brain MRI after admission showed ischemic lesions confined to the right pre- and postcentral gyri and the medial frontal cortex on DWI and FLAIR images. An analysis of SPECT images revealed that the most decreased areas were localized to the pre- and postcentral gyri, superior and inferior parietal lobules, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Considering the previous reported cases, the responsible lesion for the impaired perception of hylognosia and morphagnosia may not necessarily be confined to the right hemisphere. To date, 5 reports (6 cases) of <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> have been published; 4 cases presented with both ahylognosia and amorphagnosia, while 1 presented with only amorphagnosia, and another showed amorphagnosia and mild ahylognosia. Our case is the first to present with only amorphagnosia without <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia.</b> The mechanism for the well-preserved recognition of real objects may depend on the preserved hylognosia. Of note, there have been no reports showing only ahylognosia without amorphagnosia. Further studies are necessary to clarify whether or not patients with preserved hylognosia or morphagnosia retain the ability to perceive real objects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{has been}} {{described}} after lesions of the primary sensory cortex but the exact location and extension of those lesions is not clear. We report the clinical features and imaging findings in a patient with an acute ischemic stroke restricted to the primary sensory area (S 1). A 73 -year-old man had a sudden onset of a left alien hand, without left hemiparesis. Neurological examination showed intact primary sensory functions, but impaired recognition of shape, size (macrogeometrical) and texture (microgeometrical) of objects; damage confined to the post-central gyrus, sparing the posterior parietal cortex was demonstrated on MRI. An embolic occlusion of the anterior parietal artery was suspected as mechanism of stroke. <b>Tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> with impaired microgeometrical and macrogeometrical features&#x 2032; recognition can result from a single lesion in the primary sensory cortex (S 1) in the right parietal hemisphere, sparing {{other regions of the}} cerebral cortex which presumably participate in tactile object recognition...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experimental}} investigations of a subject with a unilateral impairment of tactile object recognition without impaired tactile sensation, several issues were addressed. First, is <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> secondary to a general impairment of spatial cognition? On tests of spatial ability, including those directed at the same spatial integration process assumed to be taxed by tactile object recognition, the subject performed well, implying a more specific impairment of high level, modality specific tactile perception. Secondly, {{within the realm of}} high level tactile perception, is there a distinction between the ability to derive shape (‘what’) and spatial (‘where’) information? Our testing showed an impairment confined to shape perception. Thirdly, what aspects of shape perception are impaired in <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia?</b> Our results indicate that despite accurate encoding of metric length and normal manual exploration strategies, the ability tactually to perceive objects with the impaired hand, deteriorated as the complexity of shape increased. In addition, asymmetrical performance was not found for other body surfaces (e. g. her feet). Our results suggest that tactile shape perception can be disrupted independent of general spatial ability, tactile spatial ability, manual shape exploration, or even the precise perception of metric length in the tactile modality...|$|E
40|$|A chronic tactile agnosic with a small, MRI-documented left {{inferior}} parietal infarction underwent detailed somesthetic {{testing to}} assess (1) {{the acquisition of}} sensory data, (2) the manipulation of somatosensory percept and its association with previous knowledge, and (3) recognition occurring at a deeper taxonomic level. Results suggest that <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> can arise from faulty high-level perceptual processes, but {{that the ability to}} associate tactually defined objects and object parts with episodic memory can be preserved. Consistent with anatomic and physiologic studies in nonhuman primates, inferior parietal cortex (including Brodmann area 40, possibly area 39) appears to serve as a high-level somatosensory region...|$|E
40|$|Disorders of tactile object {{recognition}} (TOR) {{may result from}} primary motor or sensory deficits or higher cognitive impairment of tactile shape representations or semantic memory. Studies with healthy participants suggest the existence of exploratory motor procedures directly linked to the extraction of specific properties of objects. A pure deficit of these procedures without concomitant gnostic disorders has never been described in a brain-damaged patient. Here, we present a patient with a right hemispheric infarction who, in spite of intact sensorimotor functions, had impaired TOR with the left hand. Recognition of 2 D shapes and objects was severely deficient under the condition of spontaneous exploration. Tactile exploration of shapes was disorganized and exploratory procedures, such as the contour-following strategy, which is necessary to identify the precise shape of an object, were severely disturbed. However, recognition of 2 D shapes under manually or verbally guided exploration and the recognition of shapes traced on the skin were intact, indicating a dissociation in shape recognition between active and passive touch. Functional MRI during sensory stimulation of the left hand showed preserved activation of the spared primary sensory cortex in the right hemisphere. We interpret the deficit of our patient as a pure tactile apraxia without <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia,</b> i. e. a specific inability to use tactile feedback to generate the exploratory procedures necessary for tactile shape recognitio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} novel methodical {{approach}} to lesion analyses involving high-resolutionMR images {{in combination with}} probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. 3 D-MR images of the whole brain and the man-ually segmented lesion mask are spatially normalized to the reference brain of a stereotaxic probabilistic cytoarchitectonic atlas using a multiscale registration algorithm based on an elastic model. The procedure is demonstrated in three patients suffering from aperceptive <b>tactile</b> <b>agnosia</b> of the right hand due to chronic in-farction of the left parietal cortex. Patient 1 presents a lesion {{in areas of the}} postcentral sulcus, Patient 3 in areas of the superior parietal lobule and adjacent intraparietal sulcus, and Patient 2 lesions in both regions. On the basis of neurobehavioral data, we conjectureddegradation of sequential elementary sensory informa-tion processingwithin the postcentral gyrus, impeding texture recognition in Patients 1 and 2, and disturbed kinaesthetic information processing in the posterior parietal lobe, causing degraded shape recognition in the patients 2 and 3. The involvement of Brodmann areas 4 a, 4 p, 3 a, 3 b, 1, 2, and areas IP 1 and IP 2 of the intrapar-ietal sulcus was assessed in terms of the voxel overlap between the spatially transformed lesion masks and the 50 %-isocontours of the cytoarchitectonic maps. The disruption of the critical cytoarchitectonic areas and the impaired subfunctions, texture and shape recognition, relate as conjectured above.

40|$|Conscious {{awareness}} {{is a fascinating}} psychological function of the human mind. It describes a subjective first-person phenomenon (Damasio, 1998), that consists in both the cognitive processes {{of the self and}} its interactions with the external world. Therefore the construction of the self-awareness includes all the experiences re-lated to the body (James, 1980), in order to process and to represent the perceptual, motor, emotional and cognitive states as own bodily states. This function results to be impaired in several neuropsychological and neurologi-cal disorders (Flashman, 2002), causing interferences with the personal identity or the awareness about ourselves (Orfei, et al., 2007). These pathological conditions reveal insight to scientifically investigate the cognitive processes and the neuroanatomical networks involved in awareness of the bodily self (Fotopoulou, 2012). The self-awareness include both the 'sense of agency' as the feelings of the authorship and control of our actions and of the following changes on the external world and the 'sense of ownership' as the appreciation of the body as belonging to me (Gallagher, 2000) and they can be selectively or simultaneously impaired. The specific disorder of body agency is the Anosognosia for hemiplegia (Babinski, 1914), as the apparent unawareness of own sensorimotor deficits or the inability to acknowledge and appreciate the severity of the paralysis and other sensorimotor deficits following stroke (Cocchini, Beschin, Cameron, Fotopoulou, & Della Sala, 2009) Indeed the disturbances affecting the body ownership are the inability to recognize one's own body ('asomatognosia', Cutting, 1978) and the misattribution of ownership of own arm to another person ('somatoparaphrenia', Gerstmann, 1942). This thesis aims to investigate the possible influences of bodily aspects in self-awareness, by focusing on the specific role of actions. In Chapter 1 and 2, I introduced the disturbances of self-awareness of the Anosognosia for Hemipleia, and Somatoparaphrenia with neuropsychological and neuroanatomical accounts. Subsequently I wanted to highlight the importance of planning an action in these deficits in order to enhance the degree of motor awareness through both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms. My main projects focused on the investigation {{of the role of the}} Action in Anosognosia for Hemiplegia. In details in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 my experiments based on evaluating the fluctuations of motor awareness in patients with Anosognosia for Hemiplegia during the request to execute an action. I investigated this issue in some different tasks: in the attempts to act, in third-perspective view and in automatic bodily activation by measuring skin conductance responses. In addition I modulated the affective resonance of these tasks by using dangerous stimuli, so that I could evaluate the influences of both bottom-up sensorimotor and top-down emotional and cognitive components in awareness' fluctuations. I also integrated brain lesion-analyses to understand the neural networks underneath. In Chapter 6, I integrated the thesis with a single-case study of a patient with Crossed Somatoparaphrenia. This rare disorder gave me the possibility to investi-gate some aspects related to the body image and the body schema. I studied this patient in different situations assessing: multisensory integration and spatial components of proprioception and third-perspective view, in order to evaluate both sensorial and higher-order possible effects relating to the body representation. In addition, I also enclosed two single-case studies. The first was a young patient with Balint's syndrome, which was evaluated in a cross-modal task, the second a man affected by <b>Tactile</b> <b>Agnosia,</b> whit whom I applied a rehabilitation program with transcranical direct-current stimulation. These studies are included as extra experiemental studies not belonging to the main PhD topic...|$|E
