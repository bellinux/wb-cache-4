5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, once one of the largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the <b>tree</b> <b>mallow</b> (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
500|$|Craigleith lies {{close to}} North Berwick's harbour and {{historically}} {{was used as}} a rabbit warren. The rabbits were bred for food but they were wiped out by myxomatosis in the 1950s. The Atlantic puffin colony on Craigleith, once {{one of the largest in}} Britain with 28,000 pairs, became endangered from 1999 onwards, due to an invasion of the non-endemic plant <b>tree</b> <b>mallow,</b> which choked the puffins' burrows, preventing them from rearing their chicks, or [...] "pufflings". A five-year project, SOS Puffin, led by the Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick, was launched early in 2007. Since then, hundreds of volunteers have been working hard to rid the island of the problem, ferried out by boat from the Seabird Centre during the winter months, when the puffins are at sea. There are signs that the puffins are starting to return to the island to breed. Fidra, Inchmickery and Eyebroughy are RSPB reserves, the last being noted for its cormorants. Over 240 species of bird and 60 varieties of seaweed have been recorded on the Isle of May.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>mallow</b> was {{considered}} a nutritive animal food in Britain in the 19th century, and is still sometimes used as animal fodder in Europe. For human consumption, some sources describe the leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>mallow</b> as edible, although not as palatable as common mallow, unless cut very thinly, because of the very velours-like hairy mouth-feel.|$|E
50|$|Many species {{previously}} {{placed in}} Lavatera {{have now been}} transferred to the related genus Malva. Lavatera species are known as <b>tree</b> <b>mallows,</b> or rather ambiguously as rose mallows, royal mallows or annual mallows.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>mallow's</b> recent {{increased}} range among Scottish islands {{has raised}} concerns {{that it is}} displacing native vegetation, and is reducing Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) populations in affected areas. The plant forms dense stands along the island coasts that inhibit breeding, and causes the puffins to abandon their burrows.|$|R
50|$|Firebugs {{generally}} mate in April and May. Their diet consists {{primarily of}} seeds from lime <b>trees</b> and <b>mallows</b> (see below). They {{can often be}} found in groups near the base of lime tree trunks, on the sunny side.|$|R
