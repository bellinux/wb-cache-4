40|$|The basic {{operation}} of a wound-rotor induction-motor drive fed by inverters on the stator {{as well as the}} rotor side is discussed. Different modes of operations are defined and explained based on power flow on both the sides of the machine. The sensorless motor control scheme consists of V/f-type direct frequency control on one side, with either vector control or direct torque and flux control on the other side. The machine operates up to <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> speed in either direction, with full flux and torque, thereby producing up to <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> power. Novel frequency profiles are proposed, which ensure that the frequency on either side never drops below a minimum value (set at 12 Hz in this work). Therefore, the estimation of flux can be simply and reliably carried out by integration of voltage, resulting in simple sensorless control. The drive works reliably at all speeds including zero speed and at all loads. Results from a 50 -hp prototype drive are presented...|$|R

25|$|The Beatles {{served as}} {{cultural}} ambassadors in Japan, where the authorities had viewed the band in an unfavourable light until their appointment as MBEs in 1965.

While the more progressive-minded elements of the population welcomed the spirit of change and youthful optimism that the Beatles represented, traditionalists were opposed to the band's influence. To meet Epstein's requirement of $100,000 (around $750,000 in 2016) for each performance, the 10,000-seat Nippon Budokan hall was chosen; tickets were priced at <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of any previous visiting pop act.|$|E

Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed bladder cancer and prostate cancer at higher rates than the general population. The risk of bladder cancer may be present in female firefighters, but research is inconclusive as of 2014. Preliminary research from 2015 on a large cohort of US firefighters showed a direct relationship {{between the number of}} hours spent fighting fires and lung cancer and leukemia mortality in firefighters.

50|$|Whereas a {{sound wave}} or an {{electromagnetic}} wave of any frequency is possible, inertial waves can exist only {{over the range}} of frequencies from zero to <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> rotation <b>rate</b> of <b>the</b> fluid. Moreover, {{the frequency of the}} wave is determined by its direction of travel. Waves traveling perpendicular to the axis of rotation have zero frequency and are sometimes called the geostrophic modes. Waves traveling parallel to the axis have maximum frequency (<b>twice</b> <b>the</b> rotation <b>rate),</b> and waves at intermediate angles have intermediate frequencies. In free space, an inertial wave can exist at any frequency between 0 and <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> rotation <b>rate.</b> A closed container, however, can impose restrictions on the possible frequencies of inertial waves, as it can for any kind of wave. Inertial waves in a closed container are often called inertial modes. In a sphere, for example, the inertial modes are forced to take on discrete frequencies, leaving gaps where no modes can exist.|$|R

25|$|The primary {{benefit of}} DDR3 SDRAM over its {{immediate}} predecessor, DDR2 SDRAM, {{is its ability}} to transfer data at <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> (eight times the speed of its internal memory arrays), enabling higher bandwidth or peak data rates. With two transfers per cycle of a quadrupled clock signal, a 64-bit wide DDR3 module may achieve a transfer rate (in megabytes per second, MB/s) of up to 64 times the memory clock speed (in MHz). With data being transferred 64 bits at a time per memory module, DDR3 SDRAM gives a transfer rate of (memory clock rate) × 4 (for bus clock multiplier) × 2 (for data rate) × 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus with a memory clock frequency of 100MHz, DDR3 SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 6400 MB/s.|$|E

500|$|Two {{changes to}} the global {{atmosphere}} due to anthropogenic activity threaten marine mammals. The first is increases in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion, and this mainly affects the Antarctic and {{other areas of the}} southern hemisphere. An increase in ultraviolet radiation has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance, which forms the basis of the food chain in the ocean. The second effect of global climate change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. [...] Raised sea levels, sea temperature and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species, and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory routes. The Arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears. Arctic sea ice is the polar bear's habitat. It has been declining at a rate of 13% per decade because the temperature is rising at <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> {{of the rest of the}} world.

[...] On 4 December 1757, from {{his position on the}} Schönberg, a knoll about [...] west of Borna, he surveyed the familiar landscape with his generals. A plan emerged. In front of him, a cluster of low hills dotted the landscape along an axis approximately parallel to the Austrian line. He knew the names of the hills: Schleierberg, Sophienberg, Wachberg, Butterberg. They were hardly hills, more like hillocks, but they were high enough to provide a screen for his troops. Facing an army twice his size, he had to rely on his own army's tactical training and use the terrain to maneuver his men into optimal position. Frederick had one of the finest armies in Europe: his troopsany companyfired at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire a phenomenal five, <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of fire of most European armies.
