40|$|The {{article for}} the first time in the Russian Humanities {{considers}} <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>glamour</b> through <b>the</b> prism of universal aesthetic categories. The essence of the conception is to explore <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>glamour</b> not in <b>the</b> sphere of its existence, but to perform global ontological phenomena to which its genesis leads. Following the methodology of Alexander Baumgarten the author of the article consistently compares glamour to aesthetic categories. In this article <b>the</b> author relates <b>glamour</b> with <b>the</b> categories of the beautiful, the sublime and the tragic. The article demonstrates <b>the</b> incompatibility of <b>glamour</b> with high aesthetic categories...|$|R

It also includes her dripping in twenty million {{dollars worth of}} vintage jewels and gowns in several transformations, including an original 25carat ring and bracelet that was worn by West in the 1933 film, She Done Him Wrong.

The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and <b>the</b> <b>glamour</b> shot scenes.
