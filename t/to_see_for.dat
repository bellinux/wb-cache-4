Second Sons designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found {{they were able to}} adopt the DualShock 4's touchpad into Second Sons gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 touchpad).|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Major Schmidt decided he needed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> himself what was {{happening}} at the bridges. He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a motorcycle escort. Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{understudy}} rehearsal, Jim's fiancée Laura (the understudy for Lady Macbeth) {{helps him}} learn lines in Tony's dressing room. Company manager Felicity arrives and scolds them {{for using the}} room. While Jim is absent, Felicity flirts with Laura. Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop of blood on the floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the invasion, the Athenians began rebuilding their city under the guidance of Themistocles. They wished to restore the fortifications of Athens, but the Spartans objected on the grounds that no place north of the Isthmus should be left that the Persians could use as a fortress. Themistocles urged the citizens to build the fortifications as quickly as possible, then went to Sparta as an ambassador to answer the charges levelled by the Spartans. There, he assured them that no building work was on-going, and urged them to send emissaries to Athens <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> themselves. By the time the ambassadors arrived, the Athenians had finished building, and then detained the Spartan ambassadors when they complained about the presence of the fortifications. By delaying in this manner, Themistocles gave the Athenians enough time to fortify the city, and thus ward off any Spartan attack aimed at preventing the re-fortification of Athens. Furthermore, the Spartans were obliged to repatriate Themistocles in order to free their own ambassadors. However, this episode may be seen as the beginning of the Spartan mistrust of Themistocles, which would return to haunt him.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Zhang {{applied to}} a Buddhist college in Beijing. His {{entrance}} exam consisted of an essay.

25|$|Originally, the Council {{was meant}} to have rather {{technical}} responsibilities: ensuring that national elections were fair, arbitrating the division between statute law (from the legislative) and regulation (from the executive), etc. The Council role of safekeeping fundamental rights was probably not originally intended by the drafters of the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic: {{it was thought that}} Parliament should be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> itself that it did not infringe on such rights. However, the Council's activity considerably extended in the 1970s.|$|E

It was then that the crew were surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time that}} the entire Sector 4 panel had been blown off. According to the analysts, these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment.|$|E

She {{struggled}} to follow until the hood fell back over her hair, and all the evil things {{came out of the}} darkness, trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke to sit on the cross-shaped snag and keep watch.|$|E
25|$|Just {{north of}} the bridge, the Niagara Scenic Parkway {{approaches}} {{the edge of the}} Niagara Escarpment. Here, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> several miles in any direction. Looking north, the remainder of the Niagara River can be seen, as can its mouth at Lake Ontario. The parkway descends the escarpment and meets NY18F and NY104 just east of the village of Lewiston. North of Lewiston, the Parkway follows a largely north–south routing as it passes through largely rural sections of the towns of Lewiston and Porter. During this stretch, it has an exit to Pletcher Road, which links the parkway to Joseph Davis State Park.|$|E

I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
25|$|Confederate cavalry under Stuart kept most Union {{forces from}} {{spotting}} Jackson on his long flank march, which started between 7 and 8 a.m. and lasted until midafternoon. Several Confederate soldiers saw the Union observation balloon Eagle soaring overhead and assumed {{that they could}} likewise be seen, but no such report was sent to headquarters. When men of the III Corps spotted a Confederate column moving through the woods, their division commander, Brig. Gen. David B. Birney, ordered his artillery to open fire, but this proved little more than harassment. The corps commander, Sickles, rode to Hazel Grove <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> himself and he reported after the battle that his men observed the Confederates passing for over three hours.|$|E
25|$|Olmec {{culture was}} unknown to historians until the mid-19th century. In 1869 the Mexican {{antiquarian}} traveller José Melgar y Serrano published {{a description of}} the first Olmec monument to have been found in situ. This monument– the colossal head now labelled Tres Zapotes Monument A– had been discovered in the late 1850s by a farm worker clearing forested land on a hacienda in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture's excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.|$|E

25|$|At 12:56, scouts from 89th Reconnaissance Squadron {{arrived on}} a hill {{on the north side}} of Remagen {{overlooking}} the village and were astonished to see that the Ludendorff Bridge was still standing. It was the only one that the Germans had not yet blown up in advance of the Allied armies' advance. Lt. Timmerman and Grimball followed the scouts on the rise <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> themselves and radioed the surprising news to Task Force Commander Engemen. Arriving on the rise, Engemen could see retreating German vehicles and forces filling Remagen's streets, all heading over the bridge, which was full of soldiers, civilians, vehicles and even livestock. Previous attacks by Allied aircraft had destroyed the vessels used to ferry civilians and workers across the Rhine. All were now forced to use the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} me to make a bridge between the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>for</b> generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{the prisoners}} of war were forgotten, a fate seen in other {{countries}} too. In the United States, a Prisoner of War Medal was established, but only in 1986. Prisoners symbolised what the public did not wish <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>For</b> the latter, they {{were not part of}} the war, did not defend their country and were living symbols of defeat. Thus, the memory of the prisoners was voluntarily buried, just as they themselves tried to forget in order to continue to live. However, they were the ones best suited to reflect on the Germans with whom they lived. The richness of their memoirs reveals analyses that are sometimes quite advanced, as is for instance the case with Jacques Rivière. For historiography, the prisoner is a hinge between two countries, who can reveal the importance of what was culturally and nationally at stake during the period.|$|E
