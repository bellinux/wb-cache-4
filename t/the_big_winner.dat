In men's kayak, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> was Germany with five medals (three golds, one silver and one bronze). Hungary won medals in all nine events of women's kayak. Athlete {{comments}} ranged from disgust over the format adjustment {{made to the}} canoe sprint program for the 2012 Summer Olympics to not being upset at all. Paddleability's success at these championships will hopefully push for inclusion into future Paralympic level events.|$|E
5|$|The United States was <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> {{at these}} championships with four medals. Todd Lodwick and Bill Demong each won two medals with two golds for Lodwick (10km {{individual}} normal hill, 10km mass start), {{and a gold}} (10km individual large hill) and a bronze (10km individual normal hill) for Demong. Demong's disqualification in the ski jumping part of the 4 x 5 team event led to the United States withdrawal from the cross country part of the event. This led to a surprise gold medal for the Japanese in the team event, their first {{at the world championships}} in this event since 1995.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E

25|$|After Napoleon's fiasco in Russia in 1812, {{including}} {{the deaths of}} many Germans in his invasion army, Prussia joined with Russia. Major battles followed in quick order, and when Austria switched sides to oppose Napoleon, his situation grew tenuous. He was defeated in a great Battle of Leipzig in late 1813, and Napoleon's empire started to collapse. One after another the German states switched to oppose Napoleon, but he rejected peace terms. Allied armies invaded France in early 1814, Paris fell, and in April Napoleon surrendered. He returned for 100 days in 1815, but was finally defeated by the British and German armies at Waterloo. Prussia was <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> at the Vienna peace conference, gaining extensive territory.|$|E

Bogucharsky was also nominated for Best Actor. It {{was nominated for}} Best Film and Best Actress at the European Film Awards. It was Sweden's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 75th Academy Awards, which sparked some controversy when the Academy considered to deem it ineligible since the primary language is not Swedish. Eventually it was accepted, but failed to be nominated. In November 2009 the film magazine FLM published {{a list of the}} 10 best Swedish films of the decade as voted by 26 of the country's leading critics.

25|$|Post-war {{parliamentary}} elections could finally {{be held in}} May 1946. In the election campaign Beel voiced the political resistance from the religious and liberal parties against the economic planning and socialism favoured by Prime Minister Schermerhorn and his political supporters. Unlike the British elections {{of the previous year}} where the Labour Party gained a decisive victory, in the Netherlands the 'Socialist breakthrough' which had been expected did not materialise in these first post-war elections. The Catholic People's Party) was <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner,</b> though no party had an overall majority. Queen Wilhelmina requested Beel to form a new cabinet. He became Prime Minister of a 'red-Roman coalition', which he called the 'New Truce', since it was the first cabinet in Dutch history of socialists and Roman Catholics. This Beel-cabinet set the course for the political and economic development of the post war Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 2010, {{the cabinet}} fell when the PvdA refused {{to prolong the}} {{involvement}} of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan, Afghanistan. Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010, with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats. The VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, closely followed by the PvdA with 30 seats. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders, whose right wing PVV, the ideological successor to the LPF, more than doubled its number of seats. Negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government, led by VVD (a first) in coalition with CDA, which was sworn in on 14 October 2010. This unprecedented minority government was supported by PVV, but proved ultimately to be unstable, when on 21 April 2012, Wilders, leader of PVV, unexpectedly 'torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks' on new austerity measures, paving the way for early elections.|$|E

Huckabee spent $57.98 per {{vote in the}} Straw Poll, which is the lowest among the top three finishers. Since Romney was {{expected}} by the vast majority to take first in the poll, many declared Huckabee <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner.</b> The National Review said that [...] "When it was all over, {{there was no doubt}} that the winner of the day was Huckabee." [...] Huckabee told reports that [...] "It is beyond huge. Tonight, for all practical purposes, we won the Iowa straw poll. No one was even saying we would come in second.

The housemate with the least viewer votes is eliminated.

2500|$|The show premiered its pilot episode on July 11, 2016. [...] Their stay in Vietnam {{lasted for}} three (3) {{weeks in the}} broadcast, perhaps {{two weeks in the}} live events.

2500|$|When {{the votes}} were counted after February 25, {{republic}} wide, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> was the Popular Front of Moldova {{and their allies}} in the reformist wing of the Communist Party of Moldova. Of the 380 seats in the Supreme Soviet of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic, the Popular Front would control 101, or about 27 percent. The internationalists had a strong showing as well, capturing almost 80 seats—21 percent. [...] However, while both sides claimed the support of those not formally tied to their organizations, the Popular Front had considerably more allies. The Communist Party had a more disappointing if not insignificant showing, with 53 of the parliamentary seats going {{to members of the}} party apparatus and with its members comprising 83 percent of those elected. [...] However, what is of interest to this chapter is that, in 1990 as the republic polarized to the point of schism in September, those apparatus workers that were elected quickly aligned themselves with either the Popular Front and the parliamentary leadership, or with the OSTK-led opposition. There was no significant correlation between apparatus work and either movement.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrari was {{the great}} {{favorite}} with a 3-litre version of his well tested powerful sports car V12 design, but the new cars were very heavy, probably in an excess of self-confidence. An enlarged V6 held some promise but Surtees left mid-season after a dispute with team manager Eugenio Dragoni at the 24 Hours of Le Mans sportscar race. Coventry-Climax, formerly supplier {{to much of the}} field, pulled out of the sport leaving teams like Lotus to struggle with enlarged versions of obsolete Climax engines. Cooper turned to a development of an otherwise obsolete Maserati V12 that was originally designed for the Maserati 250 F in the late 1950s, while BRM made the choice to design an incredibly heavy and complex H-16. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> was Jack Brabham, whose eponymous racing team took victory two years running with a light and compact spaceframe chassis powered by the aluminium-block stock-derived Repco V8 unit. With SOHC heads and no more than 330bhp, the Repco was one of the least powerful of the new 3-litre engines but unlike the others it was light, reliable and available right {{from the start of the}} new rules. 1966 was Jack's year, while [...] went to his teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme, as Jack tried new parts on his car.|$|E
