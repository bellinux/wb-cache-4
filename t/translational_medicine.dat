30|$|Another {{topic of}} <b>translational</b> {{respiratory}} <b>medicine</b> is {{to translate the}} understanding of molecular mechanisms into personalized medicine and therapies and hospital treatments and manipulations into distant electronic medicine (eMedicine).

People can reach the pulmonologist and report their symptoms and lung function tests in a real time, without the need {{to come to the}} hospital. This is a new aspect of <b>translational</b> respiratory <b>medicine</b> from clinical treatment to social prevention, static outpatient clinic to dynamic and real-time monitoring, and a small group of patients with respiratory diseases to a large population of people with any risk of respiratory disorders or discomfort. Without limits, <b>Translational</b> Respiratory <b>Medicine</b> will publish papers in all relevant areas designed to further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying organ or cell dysfunction in human pulmonary diseases, dedicated to the discovery and validation of diagnostic and prognostic disease biomarkers, and the identification and validation of novel drug targets, application of tissue genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and bioinformatics in drug efficacy and toxicity in clinical research.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a novel {{formulation}} of paclitaxel (PTX) that would improve its therapeutic index. Here, we combined a concept of polymer–PTX drug conjugate with a concept of polymeric micelle drug delivery to form novel free PTX-loaded poly(L-γ-glutamylglutamine) (PGG) –PTX conjugate nanoparticles. The significance of this drug formulation emphasizes the simplicity, novelty, and flexibility of the method of forming nanoparticles that contain free PTX and conjugated PTX in the same drug delivery system. The results of effectively inhibiting tumor growth in mouse models demonstrated the feasibility of the nanoparticle formulation. The versatility and potential of this dual PTX drug delivery system can be explored with different drugs for different indications. Novel and simple formulations of PTX-loaded PGG–PTX nanoparticles could have important implications in <b>translational</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R
