5|$|Ridley Scott {{has made}} a {{previous}} film about {{the conflict between the}} Western and Arab civilizations, Kingdom of Heaven (2005), set during the Crusades. Body of Lies resumes this <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of modern intelligence operations and terrorism.|$|E
5|$|A common <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fantasy genre is {{the battle}} between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|Djawadi {{said that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the main title music by an early version of the series's computer-animated title sequence. The title music is reprised as a global <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of the soundtrack, initially infrequently and as part of the theme of individual characters, then in full towards the end of season 1 during particularly important scenes.|$|E
5|$|Genjurō's pottery {{is also a}} major <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Professor Wood argues his pottery evolves {{in three}} phases, {{reflecting}} Mizoguchi's changing approach to filmmaking. Genjurō begins making the pottery for commercial reasons, shifts to pure aesthetics while isolated with Lady Wakasa, and finally moves on to a style that reflects life and strives to understand it.|$|E
5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film {{to be the}} inability of the church to fulfill individual spiritual needs. This is said to be shown through many of Joan's encounters with the church; as a girl she is scolded for going to confession too often, denied communion and forced to sneak into the church to take it herself, and during her trial, where she is denied confession until The Conscience confesses her instead.|$|E

5|$|Nightcrawler is a 2014 American thriller film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Dan Gilroy. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, a stringer who records violent events late at night in Los Angeles, and sells the footage to a local television news station. Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton also star. A common <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film is the symbiotic relationship between unethical journalism and consumer demand.|$|E
5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} personal identity is a strong <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E

Eventually she learns the truth about the circumstances surrounding J.R's death, and is angered at both Bobby and Bum that she had been kept in the dark about his illness and his final plan, although she makes amends.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers {{was a major}} <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war {{featured in}} the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea was the idea of prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during the Bourbon Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters– especially young Rastignac, {{who grew up in}} the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is a recurring <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|E
5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tonic that the listener might have been expecting, and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|E
5|$|Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi {{stated that}} he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. Itoi has said that, of the three, he had the strongest drive to create the first Mother video game, and that it was made for the players. He made the second game as an {{exploration}} of his personal interests, and wanted to run wild with the third. While reflecting on Mother 3 2000 cancellation, Itoi recounted the great efforts the team made to tell small parts of the story, and felt this was a core <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series' development.|$|E

5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Dave Lister, {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a genial Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew {{members on the}} ship before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began shortly {{after the release of}} Final Destination 2 (2003), though Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the {{franchise}} and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for Final Destination 3. In contrast to the previous film, which was a direct sequel to the original, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel, with the idea of featuring a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster coming from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan placed control as a major <b>theme</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Casting began in March 2005, with Winstead and Merriman landing the lead roles, and concluded in April. Final Destination 3 was filmed in Vancouver, as with the previous two installments, over a three-month period; the first two weeks were spent entirely on filming the roller-coaster's derailment.|$|E
