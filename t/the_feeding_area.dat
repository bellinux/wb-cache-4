40|$|The Arcto-Norwegian cod is {{spawning}} in {{the temperature}} stable Atlantic water, and the eggs ascend {{into the more}} temperature variable coastal water. Changes in time of peak spawning, up to 10 days within the last 60 years, are caused by changes in the cod´s age composition, peak spawning of first-time spawners being somewhat delayed. In contrast, the peak spawning in the coastal water of Calanus finmarchicus, whose nauplii are the almost exclusively food organism for <b>the</b> first <b>feeding</b> cod larvae, vary with more than 40 days due to temperature variations. It is a clear tendency {{for the majority of}} nauplii abundance peaks to be situated ahead of <b>the</b> peak first <b>feeding</b> cod larvae, especially during warm years. The temperature covariate in the spawning areas in the Norwegian coastal waters and <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> of cod in the Barents Sea. High temperatures during the egg and larval stages favour <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> condition of <b>the</b> larvae hatched first, since the concentration of nauplii is higher {{in the first part of}} the larval period. These larvae from the larger, high fecund cod females, are the largest and probably the most viable larvae produced during the season. During periods of decreasing temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>the</b> spawning sites, the production of viable larvae is more variable. High temperatures also improve and extend <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> tn <b>the</b> Barents Sea, giving support for larger year-classes. In both temperature regimes the age compostition of the spawning population of Arcto-Norwegian cod will effect the degree of match between the production cycle of nauplii and first <b>feeding</b> cod larvae. <b>The</b> spawning strategy of Arcto-Norwegian cod in relation to Calanus finmarchicus can be named a modified match/mismatch hypothesis, ensuring a adaptive larval production to varying temperature regimes of <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> of <b>the</b> cod...|$|R

They {{are often}} colorful, with forewings {{in shades of}} orange or red-brown with white or silvery streaks, and a metallic, shiny ground color.

40|$|In sexually dimorphic species, {{the parental}} {{effort of the}} smaller sex may be reduced due to {{competitive}} exclusion in <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> by <b>the</b> larger sex or physiological constraints. However, to determine gender effects on provisioning patterns, other intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting parental effort should be accounted for. Greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) exhibit sexual size dimorphism. In Fuente de Piedra colony, the lake dries out almost completely during the breeding season and both parents commute between breeding and foraging sites > 130 km away during the chick-rearing period. Applying multistate capture–recapture models to daily observations of marked parents, we determined the effects of sex, and their interactions with other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, on the probability of chick desertion and sojourn in <b>the</b> colony and <b>feeding</b> <b>areas.</b> Moreover, using stable isotopes in the secretions that parents produce to feed their chicks, we evaluated sex-specific use of wetlands.

40|$|Climate change accentuates {{the need}} for knowing how {{temperature}} impacts the life history and productivity of economically and ecologically important species of fish. We examine the influence of temperature on {{the timing of the}} spawning and migrations of North Sea Mackerel using data from larvae CPR surveys, egg surveys and commercial landings from Danish coastal fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat and inner Danish waters. The three independent sources of data all show that there is a significant relationship between the timing of spawning and sea surface temperature. Large mackerel are shown to arrive at <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> before and leave later than small mackerel and the sequential appearance of mackerel in each of <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>areas</b> studied supports <b>the</b> anecdotal evidence for an eastward post-spawning migration. Occasional commercial catches taken in winter in the Sound N, Kattegat and Skagerrak together with catches in the first quarter IBTS survey furthermore indicate some overwintering here. Significant relationships between temperature and North Sea mackerel spawning and migration have not been documented before. The results have implications for mackerel resource management and monitoring. An increase in temperature is likely to affect the timing and magnitude of the growth, recruitment and migration of North Sea mackerel with subsequent impacts on its sustainable exploitation...|$|R
50|$|During {{the various}} ice {{ages of the}} Quaternary Period, the Turracher Höhe was glaciated. In the Würm glaciation, there were partial {{currents}} of the Mura glacier, which flowed out of <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> of the Niederen Tauern to the south. About 20,000 years ago, a strong warming within 1,000 to 1,500 years made the glacial net melt off. As a rare relic of the Würm ice age, there is a glacial mill west of Turracher Lake. Further effects of the glaciation {{can be observed in}} the shape of the terrain, as well as in many individual places of the Turracher Höhe. The rounded off mountain tops with tub-like depressions between them (cirques) are the results of the tectonic movements as well as the glaciation. One example of that is the Hohe Kor. There is also a further result of ice age glacial activity there, a moraine embankment.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{wildlife}} management {{is needed for}} conservation, economic and human well-being objectives. However, traditional population control methods are frequently ineffective, unpopular with stakeholders, may affect non-target species, and can be both expensive and impractical to implement. New methods which address these issues and offer effective {{wildlife management}} are required. We used an individual-based model to predict the efficacy of a sacrificial <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> in preventing grazing damage by mute swans (Cygnus olor) to adjacent river vegetation of high conservation and economic value. The accuracy of model predictions was assessed by a comparison with observed field data, whilst prediction robustness was evaluated using a sensitivity analysis. We used repeated simulations to evaluate how the efficacy of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> was regulated by (i) food quantity, (ii) food quality, and (iii) the functional response of the forager. Our model gave accurate predictions of aquatic plant biomass, carrying capacity, swan mortality, swan foraging effort, and river use. Our model predicted that increased sacrificial <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> food quantity and quality would prevent the depletion of aquatic plant biomass by swans. When the functional response for vegetation in <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> was increased, <b>the</b> food quantity and quality in <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>feeding</b> <b>area</b> required to protect adjacent aquatic plants were reduced.

40|$|Outdoor pig {{production}} may have benefits {{in terms of}} animal welfare but could be undesirable in terms of nutrient losses. In paddocks on sandy soil grazed by lactating sows, nitrate leaching was determined using the suction cup technique {{from the start of}} grazing in October to after the following barley/pea wholecrop with perennial ryegrass. The inorganic N concentration in soil was uneven after sow grazing with the highest values found near <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>area.</b> In contrast to low nitrate leaching in the year of grazing (25 - 30 kg N ha- 1), losses were considerable in the following autumn and winter. Throughout the measuring period of 18 months, nitrate leaching inside paddocks was on average 320 kg N ha- 1 with the major part near <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>area.</b> Ten m from <b>the</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>area,</b> leaching losses were 500 kg N ha- 1 and at 16 m distance, losses were 330 kg N ha- 1.
