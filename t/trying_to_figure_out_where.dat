25|$|On December 16, 2006, the Park Police {{pulled over}} Barry for driving too slowly, which Barry later said {{was because he}} was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> to enter an {{elementary}} school's parking lot for a nonprofit foundation's event. After looking up Barry's record, the police officer told Barry that his license had been suspended and ticketed Barry for operating a vehicle on a suspended license, despite Barry's insistence to the contrary. Two days later, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Barry's license had not actually been suspended and said a computer glitch must have caused the error.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} tool {{in this effort}} was HUD's first-ever Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress. This groundbreaking survey of homelessness found that 704,000 people nationwide sought shelter {{at least once in}} a three-month period. Through the data collection for the report, and the subsequent analysis of that data, HUD learned {{a great deal about the}} demographics of homelessness. Prior to the report,according to Jackson, HUD had a hard time figuring out if national or local programs were working and a tough time just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> the homeless might be on a given night.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} pitched to ABC Entertainment, {{who gave the}} green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season {{replacement}} for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, {{executive vice president of}} development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that [...] "edical shows are hard, and it was hard <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [...] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! took a hiatus {{as a group}} {{after the}} {{commercial}} and critical success of their 1993 album Sons of Soul. According to vocalist and bassist Raphael Wiggins, each member had pursued individual music projects, and [...] "the group was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> everybody's time, space and head was at." [...] He, D'wayne Wiggins, and Timothy Christian Riley worked on songwriting and production for other recording artists during the band's hiatus, including D'Angelo, En Vogue, Karyn White, Tevin Campbell, and A Tribe Called Quest. Raphael Wiggins adopted the surname [...] "Saadiq" [...] for his professional name in 1994—"man of his word" [...] in Arabic—and released his solo single [...] "Ask of You" [...] in 1995. Their work outside the band led to rumors of a break-up during the time between albums. Tony! Toni! Toné! eventually regrouped and began recording House of Music in September 1995.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its deep single-player missions and varied enemy types. Game Revolution highlighted {{the long and}} complex levels, but admitted that players may [...] "" [...] around in circles for hours <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> to go next. This may be enjoyable for people who like puzzles and long gameplay, but it is aggravating for more action-oriented players." [...] N64 Magazine gave high marks to the game's level design and explained that the addition of mission objectives [...] "gives the game more focus and betters its predecessor's pretty limited and fairly simple key-collection." [...] The artificial intelligence of enemies was considered more advanced than GoldenEye 007s, as enemies can take refuge behind objects and pop up to throw explosives towards the player. GamePro also noted {{that they were more}} aggressive than Dinosaur Hunters. The game's large arsenal of weapons was also praised, with GameSpot remarking that the Cerebral Bore is [...] "possibly the grossest weapon ever conceived". The multiplayer mode was praised for its use of 3D space and innovative game types.|$|E

500|$|Dan Casey at Nerdist {{found the}} adage [...] "third {{time is the}} charm" [...] {{to apply to the}} episode, feeling that [...] "Rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> it fits within Marvel’s grander {{on-screen}} universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is focusing its energy on developing the eponymous agents and giving us more backstory", and though he felt that [...] "The show still needs to figure out its balance of seriousness and humor", he concluded that the [...] "show just keeps getting better." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek felt that [...] "There's a distinct feeling of treading water", finding the episodic plot to be [...] "fairly by-the-numbers for a show that's supposed to be about the fantastic", and he was disappointed in [...] "Graviton's non-appearance appearance", referring to the lack of Hall's comics' alter-ego. Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode's opening sequence, but criticized the character Skye and the focus the episode put on her rather than Coulson. He also spoke unfavorably of Quinn, noting that Hall would likely return as a villain himself in the future, but [...] "until then, S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to up its adversarial game". Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt [...] "the plot’s twists and turns clicked, even though it’s kind of embarrassing when the commercials are more engrossing than the show." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E
2500|$|Ninth track [...] "Turn It Up" [...] is one {{of several}} songs that {{reference}} Aaliyah. A 1990s tribute cut that combines elements of old school hip hop with Timbaland's beatboxing instrumentals, the song was the first full-length release preceding the album as a promotional buzz track in fall 2003. Although the song was not released commercially, it appeared on several charts, reaching number two on the German Black Charts. The tenth song, [...] "Necessary", written by Cee Lo Green, discusses Brandy's desire for her hard work to matter to loved ones, and features a syncopated, skipping beat. Eleventh track, the soulful and minimalistic [...] "Say You Will" [...] saw a woman ready to settle down, and urging her mate to join her in a domestic life. [...] "How I Feel", a serene, smoky ballad, featured Norwood warning her mate that his busy life was slowly pushing her away. The song was blend of the adult-oriented urban pop of her former albums, and the more ambient, bluesy work she was dabbling with. [...] "Should I Go", based upon Coldplay's song [...] "Clocks", is built on percussive beats, syncopated handclaps and a piano riff. Lyrically, Norwood as the protagonist openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> she fits in today.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with her}} {{previous}} albums thematical prime focus on Afrodisiac is on [...] "relationship {{with love and}} life in general." [...] "It's about passion. It's romantic, and that's where I am in my life right now," [...] Norwood noted during promotion touring in 2004, {{a time when she}} was engaged to New York Knicks guard Quentin Richardson. [...] "I'm not trying to be edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across," [...] she said. [...] "I really am all that." [...] Afrodisiac contains several references to Timbaland and longtime partner Missy Elliott, and alludes to fellow 1990s R singers such as Aaliyah and Monica. The album's opening track [...] "Who I Am" [...] discusses her rocky relationship with Robert Smith as well as the progression of her public image, while [...] "I Tried" [...] was heavily inspired by English rock band Coldplay, also incorporating lyrics of their 2000 song [...] "Sparks." [...] The tenth track [...] "Turn It Up" [...] is an homage to the early 1990s with references to Donnie Simpson's Video Soul, Kid n' Play, their 1990 film House Party and Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1996 studio album House of Music. The line [...] "'Cause I don't wanna sound familiar, want a guaranteed single, not an album filler" [...] levels indirect criticism at former main producer Rodney Jerkins. On ending track [...] "Should I Go," [...] which samples Coldplay's [...] "Clocks," [...] Norwood openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>where</b> she fits in today.|$|E
