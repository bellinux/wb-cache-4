5|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are eruptions {{that arise}} from {{interactions}} between water and magma. They are driven from thermal contraction (as opposed to magmatic eruptions, which are driven by thermal expansion) of magma when it comes in contact with water. This temperature {{difference between the two}} causes violent water-lava interactions that make up the eruption. <b>The</b> <b>products</b> of phreatomagmatic eruptions are believed to be more regular in shape and finer grained than <b>the</b> <b>products</b> of magmatic eruptions because of the differences in eruptive mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>products,</b> which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
