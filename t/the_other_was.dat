5|$|Clinton has {{identified}} two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, {{that contributed to}} his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} {{nature of his}} accord with Henry II, which meant {{that it did not}} survive Henry's death. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> his inability to control his sons and to force the other sons to accept Gruffydd as his successor.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Orsborne {{worked as}} mate on a trawler which formed part of Britain's anti-invasion force, before rejoining the Royal Navy. His wartime {{exploits}} included {{service as a}} beachmaster during the Normandy landings of June 1944, a spell as a commando in Combined Operations, and service in the Far East, where he records being captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In September 1947 Orsborne {{was one of two}} men rescued in mid-Atlantic from the abandoned ketch Lovely Lady; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> a stowaway, a Spanish greengrocer.|$|E
50|$|Morales, Ruth and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>are</b> {{captured}} by <b>the</b> Federales, with Morales offering them the gold, Bryan, and Castro {{in exchange for}} money and amnesty. Because of her American nationality, Ruth is escorted to Tampico to be deported to America, while <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>are</b> to be executed.|$|R

5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area. Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast {{for an extended period}} of time, Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves, resulting in heavy damage in the Cedar Key area. Hurricane Easy was one of two major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> Hurricane King which affected Miami.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Knott {{continued}} his legal practice in Frankfort. He declined two separate appointments offered {{to him by}} President Grover Cleveland. The first was to become Territorial Governor of Hawaii; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> an appointment to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky's attorney general in 1887 and 1888, and in 1891, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|Grace was {{seventh in}} the overall {{national}} batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above him were John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms of runs scored, Grace {{was one of only}} two players to complete 1,000. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 was not a good season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two.|$|E
25|$|Symbiosis {{refers to}} two species {{that have a}} close {{relationship}} with each <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> relationship can <b>be</b> mutualistic, when both species benefit from the relationship, commensalistic, when one species benefits and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> unaffected, and parasitistic, when one species benefits, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> harmed.|$|R

5|$|Heinrich Hertz (1887) {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated the}} resonance phenomena by building two resonant circuits, {{one of which}} was driven by a generator and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> tunable and only coupled to the first electromagnetically (i.e., no circuit connection). Hertz showed that the response of the second circuit was at a maximum when it was in tune with the first. The diagrams produced by Hertz in this paper were the first published plots of an electrical resonant response.|$|E
5|$|Juan claimed six lives (two directly) in Nova Scotia. Both of {{the direct}} deaths were due to fallen trees; one was a Halifax {{paramedic}} and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> a motorist in Enfield. Three of the four indirect deaths were {{as a result of}} a house fire started by candles when electricity was cut, and the fourth was in relief work after the storm.|$|E
5|$|NY3 was realigned in two {{locations}} between Lockport and Rochester. One was {{just east of}} Lockport, where it was straightened out to go directly from Lockport to Gasport on modern NY31, bypassing McNalls. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> between Middleport and Medina, where it was realigned to use modern NY31E instead. NY3's old alignment from Lockport to Gasport via McNalls became part of NY77 west of McNalls and NY359 north of the community. Its former routing between Middleport and Medina became NY3A.|$|E
50|$|Derrida {{proposed}} that the absolute alterity of <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>is</b> compromised because <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>is</b> <b>other</b> than <b>the</b> Self and the group. That logical problem has especially negative consequences {{in the realm of}} human geography when <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> person <b>is</b> denied ethical priority in geopolitical discourse. Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse (Oriental Studies) about Western encounters with non-Western cultures preserves the dominantor-dominated discourse of hegemony, just as misrepresenting <b>the</b> feminine as <b>Other</b> reasserts male privilege as primary in social discourse.|$|R

5|$|On August 3, 1780, Arnold {{obtained}} {{command of}} West Point. On August 15, {{he received a}} coded letter from André with Clinton's final offer: £20,000 and no indemnification for his losses. Neither side knew for some days that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> in agreement with that offer, due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines. Arnold's letters continued to detail Washington's troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On August 25, Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton's agreement to the terms.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Miller {{played in}} 13 {{first-class}} matches during the Australian summer, scoring 1,202 runs at 75.12 and taking 32 wickets at 22.65. In matches for Victoria, {{where he played}} under Hassett's captaincy, Miller scored 713 runs at 89.13 and took 14 wickets at 21.14. In all, he took 14 catches. Of the six matches in the victorious Sheffield Shield campaign, five were won and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> drawn, Miller averaging 133.40.|$|E
5|$|The Blood Beast alien costume {{was also}} {{previously}} {{used in the}} Roger Corman film Teenage Caveman (1958), which was filmed just two weeks earlier. Art director Daniel Haller, who built the rocket-ship and other props, slept at the sound stage between work sessions. Following dissatisfaction with his treatment by the Cormans, Varno pursued two successful arbitration cases, {{one of which was}} for underpayment. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> in response to Gene Corman's original story writing credit, even though Varno claimed to have written the entire story himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{books in}} the Goosebumps Gold series {{appeared}} on illustrator Tim Jacobus's website and marketing sites but were never released. In this series, Stine intended to write a sequel to The Haunted Mask II (The Haunted Mask Lives!), and a sequel to Welcome to Dead House (Happy Holidays from Dead House). It {{was one of the}} two book series by Stine that was planned to be released in 2000 (<b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> The Nightmare Room).|$|E

5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E
5|$|The huia, {{with the}} {{previously}} endangered saddleback, {{were the two}} species of classic bark and wood probers in the arboreal insectivore guild in the New Zealand avifauna. Woodpeckers do not occur east of Wallace's line; their ecological niche is filled by other groups of birds that feed on wood-boring beetle larvae, albeit in rotting wood. The woodpecker-like role was taken on by two species in two different families in the New Zealand mixed-podocarp and Nothofagus forests; one was the huia and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> the kaka.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats almost impossible. At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
