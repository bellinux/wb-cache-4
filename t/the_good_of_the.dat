5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{was born}} under {{the family name}} of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during a stay in Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 as the year of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu <b>the</b> <b>Good)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules and norms, known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E
25|$|On March 31, 1980, La Torre {{initiated}} a draft law that {{introduced a new}} crime in the Italian legal system, mafia conspiracy, and the possibility for the courts to seize and to confiscate <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons belonging to the mafia conspiracy.|$|R

The Gillikin Country had once been under <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Mombi, but she was overpowered and routed by <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Witch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, as revealed in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz. Thus, <b>the</b> Wicked Witch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North was forced {{to be no more}} than a lowly wizardess, under <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Witch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North's rule.|$|R
5|$|Scholar-officials and gentry also {{distinguished}} {{themselves through}} their intellectual pursuits. While {{some such as}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095) and Su Song (1020–1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting and antiquarianism. Yet even this pursuit {{could turn into a}} scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archeology. Shen Kuo even took an interdisciplinary approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording ancient musical measures. The scholar-official and historian Zeng Gong (1019–1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient Zhan Guo Ce, proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, such as writing local histories or gazetteers. In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying pharmaceuticals and improving calendrical science through court work in astronomy fit this ideal.|$|E
5|$|Under {{mounting}} political pressure, John finally negotiated {{terms for}} a reconciliation, and the papal terms for submission were {{accepted in the}} presence of the papal legate Pandulf Verraccio in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover. As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to £666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (£466) for England and 300 marks (£200) for Ireland, as well as recompensing the church for revenue lost during the crisis. The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea, or Golden Bull. This resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by the sequence of events, there was little public reaction. Innocent benefited from the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and continental policy issues. Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace. John paid some of the compensation money he had promised the church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two-thirds of the sum unpaid; Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wider relationship.|$|E

40|$|We make {{a formal}} sociologic study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> free will. By using <b>the</b> {{language}} <b>of</b> mathematics and logic, we define {{what we call}} everlasting societies. Everlasting societies never age: persons never age, and <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society are indestructible. <b>The</b> infinite history <b>of</b> an everlasting society unfolds by following deterministic and probabilistic laws that {{do their best to}} satisfy <b>the</b> free will <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> persons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society. We define three possible kinds of histories for everlasting societies: primitive histories, good histories, and golden histories. In primitive histories, persons are inherently selfish, and they use their free will to obtain <b>the</b> personal ownerships <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society. In <b>good</b> histories, persons are inherently good, and they use their free will to distribute <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society. In <b>good</b> histories, a person is not only able to desire <b>the</b> personal ownership <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> but is also able to desire that a good be owned by another person. In golden histories, free will is bound by <b>the</b> ethic <b>of</b> reciprocity, which states that "you should wish upon others as you would like others to wish upon yourself". In golden societies, <b>the</b> ethic <b>of</b> reciprocity becomes a law that partially binds free will, and that must be abided at all times. In other words, the verb "should" becomes the verb "must"...|$|R

50|$|Critolaus {{seems to}} have paid {{particular}} attention to Rhetoric, though he considered it, like Aristotle, not as an art, {{but rather as a}} matter of practice. Cicero speaks in high terms of his eloquence. Next to Rhetoric, Critolaus {{seems to have}} given his chief attention to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> moral philosophy, and to have made some additions to Aristotle's system. In general, he deviated very little from <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peripatetic school, though in some respects he went beyond his predecessors. For example, he held that pleasure is an evil, and definitely maintained that <b>the</b> soul consists <b>of</b> aether. <b>The</b> end <b>of</b> existence was to him <b>the</b> general perfection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural life, including <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul and the body, and also external goods.
