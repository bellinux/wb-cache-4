5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the Torah and lead the prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of partnership minyanim {{was preceded by}} an opinion by Modern Orthodox Rabbi Mendel Shapiro in 2001, subsequently joined by Bar-Ilan University Talmud Professor Rabbi Daniel Sperber, claiming that halakha (Jewish law) permits Orthodox women to be called to, and <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from,</b> the Torah on Shabbat under certain conditions. These opinions rely on earlier authorities including the Magen Avraham. Dr. Joel B. Wolowelsky also expressed an opinion which, while not offering a formal opinion on the halachic issues, suggested that the partnership minyan enterprise was not necessarily inconsistent with an Orthodox hashkafah (outlook).|$|E

25|$|However, some {{politicians}} allege {{that there is}} a creeping Islamisation of Malaysian society, and due to the links between race and religion it is thought the economic status of different races causes many religious problems. The predominance of Islam and its slow spread into everyday life in Malaysia has caused worry for non-Muslim groups. The Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in 2004 appeared at a Christian gathering <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the Bible and called for religious unity despite differences. This was done at a time when Malaysia was head of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of the Book of Mormon was a focus of Ezra Taft Benson, the church's thirteenth president. Benson stated that the church was still under condemnation for treating the Book of Mormon lightly. In an August 2005 message, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley challenged {{each member of the}} church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end. The book's importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly general conference, at special devotionals by general authorities, and in the church's teaching publications. Since the late 1980s, church members have been encouraged <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the Book of Mormon daily.|$|E

25|$|Every Yemenite Jew {{knew how}} <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the Torah Scroll {{with the correct}} {{pronunciation}} and tune, exactly right in every detail. Each man who was called up to the Torah read his section by himself. All this was possible because children {{right from the start}} learned to read without any vowels. Their diction is much more correct than the Sephardic and Ashkenazic dialect. The results of their education are outstanding, for example if someone is speaking with his neighbor and needs to quote a verse from the Bible, he speaks it out by heart, without pause or effort, with its melody.|$|E
25|$|A synagogal {{prerogative}} of the exilarch was {{mentioned in the}} land of Israel as a curiosity : The Torah roll was carried to the exilarch, while every one else {{had to go to the}} Torah <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> it. This prerogative is referred to also in the account of the installation of the exilarch in the Arabic period, and this gives color to the assumption that the ceremonies, as recounted in this document, were based in part on usages taken over from the Persian time. The account of the installation of the exilarch is supplemented by further details in regard to the exilarchate which are of great historical value; see the following section.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{practice is}} that on a Sabbath shortly after he has attained the age of thirteen, a boy is called up <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the weekly portion of the Law (five books of Moses), either {{as one of the}} first seven men or as the last, in which case he will read the closing verses and the Haftarah (selections from the books of the Prophets); and if he is unable to read, to recite at least the benediction before and after the reading. He may also give a d'var Torah (a discussion of some Torah issue, such as a discussion of that week's Torah portion) and/or lead part or all of the prayer services.|$|E

25|$|Gabriel has {{blond hair}} and multicoloured wings. His right hand is raised and in his left he holds lilies, {{traditionally}} found in paintings of the annunciation as symbols of Mary's virginity. His words to Mary are written alongside him in Latin: AVE GRACIA PLENA D(OMI)N(U)S TECU(M) ("Hail who art full of grace, the Lord is with you"). The horizontal inscription extends out the panel and halfway across the neighbouring image. As in van Eyck's Washington Annunciation of c. 1434‚Äì6, the letters of Mary's reply are inscribed in reverse and upside-down; as if for God <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> heaven, or for the holy spirit, as represented by the dove, to read as he hovers directly above her. She answers ECCE ANCILLAM D(OMI)NI ("Behold the handmaiden of the Lord").|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} years, the University had among its faculty {{a number of}} noted writers, such as Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, John Crowe Ransom, Hiram Haydn, Peter Taylor, Robie Macauley and Randall Jarrell. They invited other {{distinguished}} writers to campus <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> their work and to meet with students; these writers included Robert Lowell, Robert Frost, Flannery O'Connor, Robert Penn Warren, Eudora Welty, and Saul Bellow. In 1965, {{under the leadership of}} Robert Watson, creative writing offerings were formalized. Since that time, enrollment has grown, but the faculty has intentionally kept the program small, enabling students to have individual conferences with faculty. Notable faculty members have included Fred Chappell, H.T. Kirby-Smith, Michael Parker, Craig Nova, Stuart Dischell, Jennifer Grotz and David Roderick. Notable graduates include Claudia Emerson, Steve Almond, Keith Lee Morris, Lee Hadaway and Rodney Jones.|$|E
25|$|The person {{called up}} <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>from</b> the Torah ‚Äì the summons is called an aliyah {{and the person}} so honored is called an oleh ‚Äì hastens from his seat to the desk, going {{directly}} to the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin ‚Äì not the writing ‚Äì of the scroll), and then he may close his eyes, or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E
