5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
2500|$|Polyploidy refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{numerical}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{whole set}} of chromosomes. Organisms in which a particular chromosome, or chromosome segment, is under- or overrepresented {{are said to be}} aneuploid (from the Greek words meaning [...] "not", [...] "good", and [...] "fold"). Therefore, the distinction between aneuploidy and polyploidy is that aneuploidy refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> numerical <b>change</b> <b>in</b> part of the chromosome set, whereas polyploidy refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> numerical <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the {{whole set of}} chromosomes.|$|R

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if {{they are able to}} successfully switch from sorting cards based on the color of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> {{election}} law approved by Jersey City voters {{at the end}} of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, with the next election scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending {{at the end of}} 2017.

5|$|In {{southern}} Ontario, the Salem Chapel BME Church {{was designated}} a National Historic Site in 1999, {{on the recommendation}} of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. The chapel, in St. Catharines, Ontario, was a focus of Harriet Tubman's years in the city, when she lived nearby, in what was a major terminus of the Underground Railroad and center of abolitionist work. In Tubman's time, the chapel was known as Bethel Chapel, and was initially part of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, prior <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> 1856.|$|E

5|$|Pupae {{have the}} ability to enter facultative diapause, the state of arrested {{development}} and growth in response <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E

50|$|The {{demographic}} response {{consists of}} <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> {{the rates of}} predator reproduction or survival due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> prey density. The increase in prey availability translates into higher energy intake and reduced energy output. This is different from an increase in energy intake due to increased foraging efficiency, which is considered a functional response. This concept can be articulated in the Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model.|$|R

Paul promised to free all Polish political prisoners held in Russian prisons and forcibly settled in Siberia. The Tsar gave Kościuszko 12,000 rubles, which the Pole later, in 1798, attempted to return, when also renouncing the oath.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
