5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} circuits of most electroshock {{weapons are}} fairly simple, based on either an oscillator, resonant circuit (a power inverter), and step-up transformer or a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier {{to achieve an}} alternating high-voltage discharge or a continuous direct-current discharge.

The amount of amperage generated depends on what stunning capabilities are desired, but without proper amperage calculations, the cause and effect of high voltage is muted.

5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story. However, several {{references}} are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, {{the setting for}} Vagrant Story, shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in Final Fantasy XII. The Kiltia religion, featured in Final Fantasy XII, was {{the religion of the}} ghost town Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of the}} game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place Vagrant Story latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics. Matsuno has said that he never intended Vagrant Story <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1990s round of expansion, the league revised its four {{division}} alignment into one containing six divisions that eventually each contained five teams. At the time, seventeen of the league's thirty teams were {{based in the}} Eastern Time Zone, meaning that the two westernmost such teams (Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets) were compelled {{to compete in the}} Western Conference, which gave a large proportion of their road games an unfavorably late start on local television. There were other grievances with the alignment - for example, the Dallas Stars, being in the Central Time Zone were not pleased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> division as the Coyotes and the three Californian teams.|$|E
25|$|SeaLink runs {{a car and}} {{passenger}} ferry service to Great Barrier Island from a terminal {{at the base of}} Wynyard Wharf. The company was seeking clarification of its future facilities in the area in 2007, as their lease was running out in 2010, and it was unlikely to invest a planned NZ$19 million in a new terminal or start using a new, faster ferry vessel before legal concerns were sorted out. An ARC planning committee noted that it supported the further provision of the ferry service in the area, though there had previously been concerns about the island freight shipping not fitting into the redevelopment vision of the area (see below). The Waterfront Plan completed 2012 does include the island ferry terminal, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general area as before.|$|E

Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers and founder {{and leader of}} the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> room as the UAW's, so Governor Frank Murphy acted as courier and intermediary between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the U.S. National Guard, not to evict the strikers, but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike-breakers. The two parties finally reached agreement on February 11, 1937 on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees who were members of the union for the next six months.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{the editor}} of the paper l'Observateur was beaten in the street, {{stripped}} naked and photographed by members of the security police a few hundred yards from the Central Police Station. The editor reported the attack to the police. When the National Assembly summoned the minister responsible to explain the incident, he said it was the job of the police to protect the opponents of the government. The minister then proceeded to name members of the National Assembly who he considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> category of opponents. One of the named deputies, Uch Ven, tabled a censure motion that had been drawn up against the minister. Sihanouk issued a statement afterward attacking the members of the National Assembly for their hostile attitude toward the police. Within days, l'Observateur and two other papers were closed by the government, fifty people were detained indefinitely for questioning and the political director of Sihanouk's own newspaper was fired for an editorial objecting to heavy-handed political intimidation.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1965, Australia's {{involvement}} in the war increased as the government committed a full infantry battalion, the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Early the following year, this was expanded as the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) was established, operating in its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy province, {{which was in the}} III Corps Tactical Zone (III CTZ). But despite the concentration of Australian forces, the AATTV members remained dispersed, often serving with only one other advisor, either Australian or American. Unlike 1 ATF, the majority of team members were deployed in I CTZ and the Central Highlands, where the fighting was often of a higher tempo and more protracted. Thus, due to its small size and widespread area of operations, it was rare for the entire AATTV <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place at the same time; this usually occurred only on ANZAC Day– the only other occasion the whole unit paraded together was when it received the Meritorious Unit Commendation from the Commander of the US Forces in Vietnam on 30 September 1970. From October 1970 a small group of New Zealanders, consisting of one officer and four SNCOs, were attached the AATTV.|$|E
