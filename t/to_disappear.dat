5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening {{to people who are}} unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E

50|$|Ella Pontefract (1896-1945) was {{the author}} of six books on the social history of the Yorkshire Dales related <b>to</b> <b>disappearing</b> rural traditions. Though thin and {{slightly}} built she was spirited and lively minded. Her character was charming and modest.|$|R
5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> entirely.|$|E
5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually <b>to</b> <b>disappear.</b>|$|E

5|$|A family {{goes to a}} {{hotel with}} their gran, (which would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family {{so much that she}} wants them <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> as they then do. She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in a lift. Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a {{potential}} Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E
50|$|Harrington's {{mountain}} goat {{existed for}} at least 19,000 years prior <b>to</b> <b>disappearing</b> around 11,000 BC. The extinction {{is known to have}} coincided with the disappearance of at least 25 genera of land mammals, such as the Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis), and the arrival of Clovis hunters in the region.|$|R

5|$|By {{the third}} chorus, the {{interior}} expands and more kachinas are summoned; this sequence also has flowing cherry blossom leaves. The bridge re-plays {{sections of the}} animated lady but with Utada singing the song, both overlapping each other. From there, {{the interior of the}} cathedral starts <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> and move but then focuses on a herd of houses running through a vast corn field. The video ends with Utada stretching her arms against the sunlight, as the camera zooms away from her via bird's eye view, all shot by a toy airplane which was controlled by the director of the video.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|Davis, Hill, and Mitchell {{find him}} {{rumbling}} {{around in the}} power plant. Davis tries to kill him, but Steiner resists his bullets, so Hill again tries to persuade Steiner {{to return to the}} laboratory. Steiner is eventually convinced, so he goes with them, but when he arrives, he tricks them and begins destroying things. With the laboratory on fire and the projection device wildly out of control, Steiner is hit by the projection device's laser, causing him <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> as the fire rages on.|$|E

5|$|Genetic drift (also {{known as}} allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect after {{biologist}} Sewall Wright) {{is the change}} in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> completely and thereby reduce genetic variation.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{check into}} a motel, where a cow crashes {{through the roof}} of Mulder's room. After the incident, a tearful Sheila confesses that the cow might have been her fault. She admits that she's {{experienced}} a strange history of weather-related phenomena, and believes that she can unconsciously control the weather. Mulder assures her otherwise. During the conversation, Hardt overhears that Mootz was drunk {{the night of the}} accident, and is relieved. Immediately, Mootz's rain powers seem <b>to</b> <b>disappear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Surface gratings, {{consisting}} on ordered surface features due {{exposure of}} ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat. The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration <b>to</b> <b>disappear.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium <b>to</b> <b>disappear</b> and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe by singing the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - <b>to</b> <b>disappear.</b>|$|E

As Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi help to {{evacuate}} Midgar, which {{is about to be}} destroyed by Sephiroth's Meteor spell, Vincent finds the body of Professor Hojo slumped at the controls of the Sister Ray cannon. After a flash of lightning, Hojo's body seems <b>to</b> <b>disappear,</b> and before Vincent can investigate, the cannon explodes, forcing Vincent to escape with Yuffie.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth <b>to</b> <b>disappear)</b> and for a boat.
