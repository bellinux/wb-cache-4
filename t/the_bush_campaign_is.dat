5000|$|The Bush {{campaign}} dismissed {{charges of}} ties and asserted {{there was no}} co-ordination between SBVT and the campaign. Editorial opinion on the evidence for co-ordination varied. ABC News' The Note stated, [...] "There {{is no evidence that}} <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> orchestrating the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth." [...] In contrast, the New York Times opined that the SBVT attacks were [...] "orchestrated by negative-campaign specialists {{deep in the heart of}} the Texas Republican machine." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{foundation}} of Bush's campaign for re-election was ideological conservatism. Members {{of the campaign}} team believe there are clear ideological differences between George W. Bush and John Kerry, and believe this contrasts with the 2000 Presidential election, in which both candidates attempted to portray themselves as [...] "centrists". Critics {{have argued that the}} crux of Bush's campaign was the suggestion that John Kerry would be soft on terrorism in comparison to George Bush, and to present Bush as a [...] "war President". They also claim that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> concerned mainly with personalities rather than tackling ideological issues.|$|E
5000|$|The Note {{has also}} been criticized for alleged anti-Republican bias. In a memo dated October 8, 2004, Mark Halperin {{instructed}} ABC employees that while both the Kerry <b>campaign</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>were</b> guilty of distorting facts, they {{should be willing to}} say that distortions coming from <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>were</b> worse when, in Halperin's estimation, they were.http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26227-2004Oct12.html ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2004, Ginsberg gave {{legal advice}} to the {{controversial}} 527 Group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Though his simultaneous activities with the [...] "Swifties" [...] and <b>the</b> 2004 <b>Bush</b> <b>Campaign</b> could <b>be</b> considered questionable, his activities were not illegal. Nonetheless, Ginsberg resigned as legal counsel from <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>Campaign</b> after his position was made public.|$|R
5000|$|On August 25, 2004, Benjamin Ginsberg, the top {{election}} {{lawyer to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> {{on campaign finance}} law, also resigned after it was learned that SBVT {{was one of his}} clients. Ginsberg stated that he was withdrawing to avoid being a distraction to the campaign. He declared that he had acted [...] "in a manner that is fully appropriate and legal," [...] arguing that it was not uncommon or illegal for lawyers to represent campaigns or political parties while also representing 527 groups. He also maintained that he did not disclose to <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> that he <b>was</b> simultaneously representing the SBVT group. After leaving <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign,</b> Ginsberg retained his status as counsel to SBVT.|$|R
5000|$|During the recount, {{controversy}} ensued {{with the}} discovery of various irregularities that had occurred in the voting process in several counties. Among these was the Palm Beach [...] "butterfly ballot," [...] which resulted in an unusually high number of votes for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. Conservatives claimed that the same ballot had been successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office. Also, before the election, the Secretary of State's office had expunged tens of thousands of citizens identified as felons from the Florida voting rolls, with African-Americans identified on some counties' lists at up to five times their share of the population. Democrats claimed that many of these were not felons and should have been eligible to vote under Florida law. It was expected that had they been able to vote, most would have chosen the Democratic candidate. Additionally, this Florida election produced many more [...] "overvotes" [...] than usual, especially in predominantly African-American precincts in Duval County (Jacksonville), where some 21,000 ballots had multiple markings, such as two or more choices for president. Unlike the much-discussed Palm Beach County butterfly ballot, the Duval County ballot spread choices for president over two non-facing pages. At the same time that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> contesting hand recounts in Democratic counties, it accepted hand recounts in Republican counties that gained them 185 votes, including votes where Republican Party workers were permitted to correct errors on thousands of applications for absentee ballots for Republicans. Alternately, Republicans charged that Democrats had registered non-citizens to vote, fought to exclude overseas military ballots, and arbitrarily changed vote-counting criteria after the election.|$|R
5000|$|The Harvard Educational Review calls Old Nazis, the New Right, and the Republican Party an {{important}} book [...] "which exposes {{the roots and}} growth of domestic fascist networks." [...] In the same book Bellant documents Nazi involvement in the Ukraine; The Nation said [...] "Bellant's exposure of émigré Nazi leaders from Germany's World War II allies in <b>the</b> 1988 <b>Bush</b> presidential <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> driving force in the announced resignation of nine individuals, two of them from Ukraine". Former Office of Special Investigations director Allan A. Ryan called it, [...] "Well-documented, and reliable".|$|R

5000|$|Since then, Arnebeck {{has focused}} on what he claims is the {{fraudulent}} use of electronic voting machines in elections, a main issue in the 2004 suit, as the major threat to American elections. When <b>the</b> former <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> operative Michael Connell died in a 2008 light aircraft crash in Ohio after being deposed by Arnebeck in his on-going suits on the 2004 election, Arnebeck felt that Karl Rove and others in <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> 2004 <b>campaign</b> might <b>be</b> linked to the crash. [...] On July 26th, 2016, Arnebeck posted {{an open letter to}} President Obama & Vice President Biden claiming that Karl Rove helped Hillary Clinton win the 2016 Democratic Primary through voting machine hacks, assassinations, and other election fraud tactics. As of August 4th, 2016, Arnebeck believes his current witnesses are at risk since he believes that at least two of his past witnesses, former state legislative candidate Beverly Campbell and Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, were assassinated.

5000|$|During the 1988 U.S. presidential election, the Willie Horton {{attack ads}} run against Democratic {{candidate}} Michael Dukakis built upon the Southern strategy {{in a campaign}} that reinforced the notion that Republicans best represent conservative whites with traditional values. Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes worked on the campaign as George H. W. Bush's political strategists, and upon seeing a favorable New Jersey focus group response to the Horton strategy, Atwater recognized that an implicit racial appeal could work outside of the Southern states. The subsequent ads featured Horton's mugshot and played on fears of black criminals. Atwater said of the strategy, [...] "By the time we're finished, they're going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis' running mate." [...] Al Gore {{was the first to}} use the Willie Horton prison furlough against Dukakis and, like <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign,</b> would not mention race. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> claimed they <b>were</b> initially made aware of the Horton issue via the Gore campaign's use of <b>the</b> subject. <b>Bush</b> initially hesitated to use the Horton campaign strategy, but the campaign saw it as a wedge issue to harm Dukakis who was struggling against Democratic rival Jesse Jackson.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{focuses on}} the online campaigning of presidential {{candidates}} during the 2004 US presidential campaign. A random sample of {{the front pages of}} the websites and weblogs (‘‘blogs’’) of George W. Bush and John Kerry was collected between Labor Day and Election Day 2004. These pages were analyzed in order to examine both candidate blogs and websites in terms of online fundraising, hyperlinking practices, and concentration on certain political issues. Results suggest that candidates more frequently use websites than blogs as fundraising mechanisms. In terms of hyperlinking, <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> and Kerry <b>campaigns</b> <b>were</b> likely to confine visitors to the bounds of their websites by providing links to content within the overall site, but also linked consistently to outside, advocating sources. On the other hand, candidate blogs were more likely to provide directives to external links. Regarding issues discussed online by the campaigns, results suggest marked differences between the most salient issues in candidate blogs as opposed to candidate websites...|$|R
5000|$|The next primary {{contest in}} South Carolina was notorious for its {{negative}} tone. Although <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> said it <b>was</b> not behind any attacks on McCain, locals who supported Bush reportedly handed out fliers and made telephone calls to prospective voters suggesting among other things, that McCain was a [...] "Manchurian candidate" [...] {{and that he}} had fathered a child out of wedlock with a black New York-based prostitute (an incorrect reference to a child {{he and his wife had}} adopted from Bangladesh). Bush also drew fire for a speech made at Bob Jones University, a school that still banned interracial dating among its students. But the governor was seen to have the upper hand in a debate hosted by Larry King Live, and he won in South Carolina by nine points. McCain won primaries in Michigan, his home state of Arizona, and a handful of New England states, but faced difficulty in appealing to conservative Republican primary voters. This was particularly true in Michigan, where despite winning the primary, McCain lost the GOP vote to Bush by a wide margin. McCain also competed in the Virginia primary, counting on continued crossover support by giving a speech blasting the religious right. It backfired, and <b>Bush</b> won <b>the</b> state easily. <b>Bush's</b> subsequent Super Tuesday victories in California, New York and the South made it nearly impossible, mathematically, for McCain to catch up, and he suspended his campaign the next day.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has also}} been {{analysis}} of whether several Justices had {{a conflict of interest}} that should have forced them to recuse themselves from the decision. On several occasions, William Rehnquist had expressed interest in retiring under a Republican administration; one study found that press reports [...] "are equivocal on whether facts existed that would have created a conflict of interest" [...] for Rehnquist. At an election night party, Sandra Day O'Connor became upset when the media initially announced that Gore had won Florida, her husband explaining {{that they would have to}} wait another four years before retiring to Arizona. However, both Justices remained on the Court beyond President Bush's first term, until Rehnquist's death in 2005 and O'Connor's retirement in 2006. According to Steven Foster of the Manchester Grammar School: On the eve of the election Sandra Day O'Connor had made a public statement that a Gore victory would be a personal disaster for her. Clarence Thomas's wife was so intimately involved in <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> that she <b>was</b> helping to draw up a list of Bush appointees more or less at the same time as her husband was adjudicating on whether the same man would become the next President. Finally, Antonin Scalia's son was working for the firm appointed by Bush to argue his case before the Supreme Court, the head of which was subsequently appointed as Solicitor-General. Various ethics experts have asserted that there was no significant conflict of interest for Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia.|$|R
50|$|Critics and the Kerry {{campaign}} {{pointed to}} several specific connections between SBVT and <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign.</b> <b>The</b> Kerry <b>campaign</b> asserted that <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> headquarters in Florida distributed fliers promoting SBVT events, a charge <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> denied. Kenneth Cordier, former vice-chair of Veterans for Bush/Cheney (in 2000) and volunteer member of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> veterans steering committee, {{appeared in the}} second SBVT advertisement. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> asked him to resign and stated {{that it had been}} unaware of his SBVT involvement.|$|R
5000|$|Bush officially {{announced}} his candidacy in June 2015, {{at which point}} Mike Murphy took over leadership of Right to Rise.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> advertised across <b>the</b> U.S. against Democratic candidates, {{including}} Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry. Kerry {{and other}} Democrats attacked <b>Bush</b> on <b>the</b> Iraq War, and {{accused him of}} failing {{to stimulate the economy}} and job growth. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> portrayed Kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq, and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.|$|R

5000|$|In {{spring of}} 2015, donors were {{concerned}} [...] "that focusing {{so much on}} filling the super PAC’s coffers might leave the <b>campaign</b> cash-poor"; yet <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> initially built [...] "out a massive campaign with ballot-access teams working every state and senior staffers earning more than $200,000 annual salaries" [...] and [...] "hired scores of policy aides".

[...] <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign</b> did not condemn SBVT or the SBVT ads. The campaign did not endorse the group either, stating [...] "We have not and we will not question Senator Kerry's service in Vietnam." [...] Kerry was dismissive of this statement, saying, [...] "Of course, the President keeps telling people he would never question my service to our country. Instead, he watches as a Republican-funded attack group does just that." [...] Kerry also alleged that SBVT was [...] "a front for <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>campaign.</b> And <b>the</b> fact that the President won’t denounce what they’re up to tells you {{everything you need to know}} - he wants them to do his dirty work".
