5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria's first child, Victoria, Princess Royal, {{was born}} on 21 November 1840, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the {{arrangements}} for the nursery staff. Lehzen put the nursery {{in the hands of}} a Mrs. Southey, a Mrs. Roberts, and Sir James Clark, despite Albert's objections that Clark was wholly unsuited to the post, having already discredited himself during the affair of Lady Flora Hastings a year previously. Eventually, the Princess Royal fell ill, but the incompetent Dr. Clark declared it a minor ailment, incorrectly prescribing her with calomel. In fact, the young Princess Victoria had become seriously ill. Albert, who was devoted to his first-born, confronted Victoria on the incompetence of the staff selected by the Baroness. There was a quarrel, after which Albert declared that he would leave the affair in her queenly hands, and be it on her head if the child died. Soon after this argument, Victoria gave in to him and ultimately dismissed Lehzen, ostensibly for her health. To Albert, Lehzen was a servant who had attempted <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> her place in life, and he wanted Victoria to rely on him alone.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which I have described eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism.

2500|$|There is {{scientific}} {{support for the}} concept of a temperature set point - that is, maintenance of an optimal temperature for the metabolic processes that life depends on. [...] Nervous activity in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body's temperature setpoint. [...] As the temperature that these neurons are exposed <b>to</b> <b>rises</b> <b>above</b> 37°C, the rate of electrical discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons increases progressively.

According to series creator Jimmy McGovern, the series was based in part on the three years he spent as an English teacher at the Quarry Bank school in Liverpool. [...] The series was well reviewed by British critics, who praised its realism as compared to other well known school dramas.|$|R
