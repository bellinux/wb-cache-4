The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial reform was so fierce <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E

5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E

At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E

Andrew gets Chris fired {{from his job as}} a lifeguard at the local swimming pool when he throws a party that gets out of control. To make things up to Chris, Andrew helps him get a job at the local gym. Summer becomes annoyed when Chris forgives Andrew so easily and then allows himself to be influenced by him into skipping school. Chris also ends up in a fight with Kyle Canning when he defends Andrew. Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) becomes concerned about Chris's behaviour and Chris later tells him he is confused about Andrew, leading Michael to realise Chris is gay.

The rumours start to affect Chris and he comes out to his class. When Andrew realises Chris has feelings for him and is annoyed.|$|E

25|$|Sports Illustrateds Stewart Mandel has Tech ranked at #10 in his preseason {{poll and}} later #8 in his college {{football}} power rankings. The team is also ranked #10 {{in the preseason}} by Fox Sports. ESPN.com writer Mark Schlabach ranked the Red Raiders #12 in his preseason poll and later #11 and #8 in revised editions of his preseason polls. In a March 26, 2008 article, Yahoo! Sports writer Olin Buchanan declared that Tech could challenge Oklahoma and Texas for supremacy in the Big 12 South in 2008. As plusses, he cited a strong quarterback (Graham Harrell), experienced wide receivers (including Michael Crabtree), and five returning starters on the offensive line. As a weakness, he mentioned the defense's trouble stopping the run but speculated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> of experience and new talent may help to alleviate this problem. Another weak spot he pointed out was the Red Raiders' trouble moving {{the ball on the}} ground on those rare instances when a rushing play is called.|$|E
25|$|Mostly, {{a year is}} a {{leap year}} if it is evenly {{divisible}} by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> divisible by four is a leap year. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this leap year problem including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998. For information on why century years are treated differently, see Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|We {{assume the}} world {{was created in the}} Hebrew month of Nissan, not Tishrei. So hour 1 (sunset) on Wednesday on this chart {{represents}} the beginning of Tekufat Nissan (Spring) {{in the first year of}} creation, the Hebrew year 1. For the purpose of Birkat Hachama, the calculation of Samuel of Nehardea for the length of a tropical year is used not the more accurate calculation of Adda bar Ahavah. Therefore, a year is assumed to be 52 weeks and 1 day and 6 hours (365.25 days). This means <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> after creation Tekufat Nissan will occur 1 day and 6 hours later on this chart, or on Thursday at the 6th hour, Jupiter. Each year this will shift another day and 6 hours. It will take 28 years for Tekufat Nissan to return to being on Wednesday at twilight. It is worth noting that the true spring equinox occurs on March 21 yet Birkat Hachama is said 18 days later. This inaccuracy accrued over thousands of years as a result of using the inexact calculation of Samuel for the length of the year.|$|E

500|$|Eorcenberht was {{the king}} of Kent at Wulfhere's accession, and the two {{families}} became connected when Wulfhere married Eorcenberht's daughter Eormenhild. [...] In 664 Eorcenberht's son Egbert succeeded to the Kentish throne. The situation in Kent at Egbert's death in 673 is not clearly recorded.

It has been speculated that Wulfhere acted as the effective ruler of Kent in the interregnum between Egbert's death and Hlothhere's accession. Another Mercian connection to Kent was through Merewalh, {{the king of}} the Magonsæte, and hence a subking under Wulfhere. Merewalh, who may have been Wulfhere's brother, was married to Hlothhere's sister, Eormenburh.|$|E
