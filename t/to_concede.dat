5|$|Slovakia– October 2011– In {{return for}} the {{approval}} of the EFSF by her coalition partners, PM Iveta Radičová had <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> early elections in March 2012, following which Robert Fico became PM.|$|E
5|$|In May, Quisling was {{shattered}} {{by the death of}} his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation over the issue of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the Nasjonal Samling.|$|E
5|$|Smith asked Walls {{for details}} of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl {{believed}} that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that {{it was already too}} late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> to this view.|$|E
50|$|Hargreaves is {{notably the}} only prop forward not <b>to</b> <b>conceded</b> a penalty under Ian Millward's tenure.|$|R

25|$|James {{has made}} the most league {{appearances}} of any goalkeeper since {{the formation of the}} Premier League over fifteen seasons, in addition <b>to</b> <b>conceding</b> the most goals. On 30 January 2008, in a league match against Manchester United, he became the third player (after Gary Speed and Ryan Giggs) to cross the 500-match threshold.|$|R
5|$|The 1957–58 {{season was}} an unusual one for Manchester City, which became the first and thus far only English team both to score and <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> 100 goals in a season. Trautmann played in 34 matches, and {{though he did not}} play in the 9–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, an 8–4 defeat to Leicester City was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match in his career, and in the entire season he kept only two clean sheets.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations {{it became clear that}} the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing <b>to</b> <b>concede,</b> and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5000|$|According to a {{web site}} {{entitled}} [...] "JusticeForWalt": [...] "On June 12, 2009 the Tax Court issued an ORDER sic accepting the IRS decision <b>to</b> <b>conceded</b> sic all the tax and penalty issue for 1995, 1996 and 1997. The ORDER indicated that a judgment for those years would be entered in Walter Anderson's favor." ...|$|R

50|$|Mirabella {{narrowly}} {{lost her}} seat of Indi at the 2013 federal election to independent candidate Cathy McGowan. She also {{resigned from the}} Coalition frontbench shortly prior <b>to</b> <b>conceding</b> defeat. She subsequently attempted to regain the seat, standing again for the Liberal Party at the 2016 election, but was defeated by McGowan again on an increased margin.|$|R
5|$|Charles re-signed for Ebbsfleet {{after joining}} on loan for 2008–09 on 21 June. He fouled Simon Brown <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> a penalty kick against Wrexham on 13 September 2008, which was scored by Brown, as Ebbsfleet lost 3–2. He was sent {{off for a}} second bookable offence late into a 1–0 defeat to Histon on 6 October 2008. After his Brentford {{contract}} was cancelled he moved to Ebbsfleet permanently on 29 January 2009, after the owners of Ebbsfleet, MyFootballClub, ratified a compensation fee of £25,000, making this the first transfer in football history {{to be decided by}} a group of members. He finished the season with 44 appearances and was named Ebbsfleet's Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Montejo {{turned his}} {{attention}} east to Olancho, which had never been successfully conquered in spite of numerous earlier expeditions. Montejo marched there with his men, while sending messages requesting support from Cerezeda and García de Solís, the royal treasurer, but they refused and Montejo was forced to retreat back to Santa María de Comayagua. By 1539, the power struggle between Montejo and Pedro de Alvarado drew {{the attention of the}} Council of the Indies; as a result Alvarado once again became governor of Honduras. Alvarado returned to Honduras in April 1539; Montejo travelled to Gracias, where he was forced <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> the governorship, and then left for Chiapas.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December three {{prisoners in}} Armagh Women's Prison joined the strike, {{including}} Mairéad Farrell, {{followed by a}} short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In a war of nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing {{in and out of}} a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December.|$|E
500|$|Soviet {{grandmaster}} Lev Alburt {{felt that}} the decision <b>to</b> not <b>concede</b> <b>to</b> Fischer's demands rested on Karpov's [...] "sober view {{of what he was}} capable of". Years later, in his 1992 match against Spassky, Fischer said that Karpov [...] "refused to play against [...] under [...] conditions".|$|R
50|$|Tottenham {{concluded}} January with an FA Cup exit at Fulham, with 2 Danny Murphy penalties {{in fifteen}} minutes sandwiched by Michael Dawson's sending off meant that Fulham were truly on their way. Brede Hangeland and Mousa Dembélé piled on the misery for Spurs. Spurs failed <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>conceding</b> 4 goals {{in the first half}} and despite an improvement in the second, their elimination was confirmed.|$|R

5|$|On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one {{of their}} own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro {{requests}} that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.|$|E
5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was not prepared <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E
5|$|The Temenggong and Sultan Ali {{submitted}} their {{proposals to}} the British Governor in April 1854. The Temenggong {{agreed to the}} Sultan's request of his titular recognition as the Sultan of Johor, but was adamant of maintaining absolute charge over the whole of Johor. On the other hand, Sultan Ali had expressed his wish to the governor that the Kesang territory (around Muar) should be directly governed by him, citing reasons {{that some of his}} ancestors were buried there. The British persuaded the Temenggong <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> to Sultan Ali's request and accepted after much consideration.|$|E

60|$|Even Marble {{knew enough}} to see the rank {{injustice}} of such an offer. In addition <b>to</b> <b>conceding</b> the non-payment of the debt, it was securing to Van Tassel, at no distant day, the quiet possession of the farm, for somewhat less than one-third its value. I detected symptoms of an outbreak in the mate, and was obliged to repress it by a sign, while I kept the discussion in my own hands.|$|R

5|$|While bishop, de Gray often lent {{the king}} money, {{and on one}} {{occasion}} held the royal regalia as security for the repayment of a loan; he {{also served as a}} royal justice. In 1203 de Gray accompanied Archbishop Hubert Walter and several papal legates on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to King Philip II of France. Philip had demanded that John's niece Eleanor of Brittany or his nephew Arthur of Brittany be surrendered to him together with all of John's lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared <b>to</b> <b>concede.</b> Philip invaded Normandy after the bishops returned to England.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Dick Clark, a Democratic Senator from Iowa, {{discovered}} the operation during a fact-finding mission in Africa, but Seymour Hersh, {{a reporter for}} The New York Times, revealed IA Feature to the public on 13 December 1975. Clark proposed {{an amendment to the}} Arms Export Control Act, barring aid to private groups engaged in military or paramilitary operations in Angola. The Senate passed the bill, voting 54–22 on 19 December 1975, and the House of Representatives passed the bill, voting 323–99 on 27 January 1976. Ford signed the bill into law on 9 February 1976. Even after the Clark Amendment became law, then-Director of Central Intelligence, George H. W. Bush, refused <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> that all U.S. aid to Angola had ceased. According to foreign affairs analyst Jane Hunter, Israel stepped in as a proxy arms supplier for South Africa after the Clark Amendment took effect. Israel and South Africa established a longstanding military alliance, in which Israel provided weapons and training, as well as conducting joint military exercises.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round Chelsea played Preston North End at home. The {{visitors}} started well {{and took the}} lead in the sixth minute through Richard Cresswell. Cudicini's timely save denied Jon Macken from extending Preston's lead soon after and Chelsea responded to the setback with an equaliser, scored by Eiður Guðjohnsen. Chelsea led after 26 minutes, but came close <b>to</b> <b>conceding</b> late on when Macken was denied once again by Cudicini. Forssell then scored Chelsea's third to settle the home side's nerves.|$|R
50|$|Jinnah and the League {{condemned}} the new government, {{and vowed to}} agitate for Pakistan by any means possible. Disorder arose in Punjab and Bengal, including the cities of Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta. On the League-organized Direct Action Day, over 5,000 people were killed across India, and Hindu, Sikh and Muslim mobs began clashing routinely. Wavell stalled the Central government's efforts to stop the disorder, and the provinces were instructed to leave this to the governors, who did not undertake any major action. To end the disorder and rising bloodshed, Wavell encouraged Nehru to ask the League to enter the government. While Patel and most Congress leaders were opposed <b>to</b> <b>conceding</b> <b>to</b> a party that was organising disorder, Nehru conceded in hope of preserving communal peace.|$|R
50|$|In May 1231 Frederick II's son Henry, King of Germany, {{issued the}} grant under {{pressure}} from the German secular princes during his rebellion against his father. The terms were very similar <b>to</b> those <b>conceded</b> <b>to</b> the ecclesiastical princes or bishops in the Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis {{at the time of the}} Henry's coronation (in 1220), conferring similar rights. Frederick II confirmed the grant in May 1232.|$|R
5|$|During the Second Sacred War Pericles led the Athenian army against Delphi and {{reinstated}} Phocis in its {{sovereign rights}} on the oracle. In 447 BC Pericles engaged {{in his most}} admired excursion, the expulsion of barbarians from the Thracian peninsula of Gallipoli, {{in order to establish}} Athenian colonists in the region. At this time, however, Athens was seriously challenged by a number of revolts among its subjects. In 447 BC the oligarchs of Thebes conspired against the democratic faction. The Athenians demanded their immediate surrender, but after the Battle of Coronea, Pericles was forced <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> the loss of Boeotia in order to recover the prisoners taken in that battle. With Boeotia in hostile hands, Phocis and Locris became untenable and quickly fell under the control of hostile oligarchs.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years passed}} {{until the next}} Scottish Cup final appearance, when United lost 1–0 to Celtic in 2005. Sandwiched {{in the middle of}} these {{appearances}} was a defeat on penalties to Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Challenge Cup (when United failed <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> a goal in the whole competition) and a 3–0 defeat to Celtic in the 1997 Scottish League Cup Final. United then lost the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2–2 after extra time. Dundee United won their next major trophy in 2010, under the guidance of manager Peter Houston, when First Division side Ross County were defeated 3–0 in the 2010 Scottish Cup Final. David Goodwillie scored the first goal and Craig Conway scored the second and third goals.|$|E
5|$|From 1808, {{a number}} of detractors argued that the {{navigation}} was in a poor condition, hoping to force Hollis <b>to</b> <b>concede</b> water rights to mills, and traffic declined. Another Act of 1811 allowed Hollis to raise the tolls, and eight years later, he held {{a meeting at the}} Winchester Guildhall, explaining why he needed to raise the tolls further. The meeting asked him to postpone his next Bill for a year, in return for which they would give him £1,200 for one year's tolls, wharfage and rent, he would spend £600 on repairs, and the remaining £600 would amount to 5 per cent interest on the estimated value of the navigation, which was then £12,000. He obtained his Act of Parliament a year later, which raised the tolls, but the Commissioners reduced freight charges at the same time, resulting in the operation being more profitable for Hollis and less so for the barge owners.|$|E

50|$|Beginning almost {{immediately}} after {{his return to the}} Senate in 2010, Latvala sought the support of his Republican colleagues to become Senate president for the 2016-2018 legislative term. In the following years, Latvala lobbied for pledges while rival conservative Republican Senator Joe Negron did the same. The leadership fight proved contentious and divided the Republican caucus, particularly during a court-ordered redistricting of the chamber's lines in 2015. While Negron declared he had support from a majority of the caucus in August 2015, Latvala refused <b>to</b> <b>conceded.</b>|$|R
