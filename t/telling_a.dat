5|$|While {{working on}} the picture book, Luna {{realized}} he missed <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> story panel by panel and {{decided to return to}} comics. He and his brother had decided to work on separate projects, so Luna pitched the idea of a young man who {{falls in love with a}} female android to Vaughn over dinner. Vaughn, who began writing and drawing romance comics in her youth, jumped at the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|As a {{guide to}} the {{contents}} of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In School Rumble, chapters marked with a sharp sign(♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign(♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> self-contained story.|$|E

5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> story, and he was pleased to have Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> story but being cut off before we can hear what it's about.

The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E

Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he was too old. Instead, he took the recommendation of Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, Fayette County Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} in September and October 2004. Although the story is set in 19th century Cardiff, the {{production}} was actually filmed in Swansea and Monmouth, as there were not enough Victorian-looking buildings left in Cardiff. Cardiff's New Theatre {{was used for the}} theatre in which Dickens is <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> story {{at the beginning of the}} episode. An empty Victorian children's home in Penarth was used for Sneed's parlour. Based on research of Victorian morgues, the production team selected red and sepia as the main color scheme.|$|E

Price, a TV minister, that was originally broadcast by the Lifetime Network in 1997. Price alleged that the clip portrayed him describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when he was actually <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> parable about a rich man. ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error. The suit concluded with an out of court settlement including a public apology by ABC.|$|E
50|$|When a {{story is}} told within another instead of being told {{as part of the}} plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's {{perceptions}} of the characters—the motives and the reliability of the storyteller are automatically in question. In Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> noble story, the boring character <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> very dull tale, and the rude miller <b>tells</b> <b>a</b> smutty tale.|$|R

5|$|Shindler {{continued}} to pitch The Second Coming to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures. His next series {{was based on}} a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child. He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show. After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown, he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them, and instead focused on <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> traditional love story and gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

Andy, however, gets angry when he hears that his college friend Broccoli Rob (Colbert) is <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> different story about the group.

50|$|Fanvids are {{analytical}} {{music videos}} made by synchronizing clips from TV shows or movies with music to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story or make an argument. “Vidders,” {{the creators of}} these videos, carefully match the audio and video components to <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> story or set a specific mood.|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|The {{bad feeling}} between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, {{the officer who}} coordinated the {{investigation}} from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 {{to write a book}} alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> Portuguese newspaper that the British police pursued leads helpful to only the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira ("Maddie: The Truth of the Lie"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies, and was later translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.|$|E
