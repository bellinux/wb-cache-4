2500|$|Nu's {{political}} life started {{as president of}} the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) with Mr. M. A. Rashid as Vice-President and [...] as the General Secretary. Aung San was Editor and Publicity Officer. Nu and Aung San were both expelled from the university after an article, Hell Hound Turned Loose, appeared in the union magazine, which was obviously about the Rector. Their expulsion sparked off the second university students' strike in February 1936. Aung San and Nu became members of the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association) which had been formed in 1930 and henceforth gained the prefix Thakin ('Master'), proclaiming they were the true masters of their own land. For a few years after independence in 1948 Nu retained the prefix 'Thakin', but around 1952 he announced that since Burma was already independent the prefix of 'Thakin' was no longer needed and henceforth he would be known as U ('Mr') Nu. In 1937 he co-founded with Thakin Than Tun the Nagani (Red Dragon) Book Club which for the first time widely circulated Burmese-language translations of the Marxist classics. He also became a leader and co-founder of the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), which later became the Socialist Party, and the umbrella organisation the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), which advocated Burmese independence from both Japanese and British control during the 1940s. He was detained by the colonial government in 1940 along with Thakin Soe, Thakin <b>Than</b> Tun, Kyaw <b>Nyein,</b> U Măd, and Dr. Ba Maw. The prison holding Nu was largely abandoned by the British {{in the course of the}} rapid Japanese advance.|$|R
