An attempt in 2002 to combine analysis of RNA features of modern chelicerates and anatomical features of modern and fossil ones produced credible results for many lower-level groups, but its results for the high-level relationships between major sub-groups of chelicerates were unstable, in other words minor changes in the inputs caused {{significant changes in the}} outputs of <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> used (POY).

500|$|Murray {{viewed the}} holonovel as {{a space in}} which the series explores Janeway's social and romantic relationships. She pointed out that Janeway chose a {{narrative}} {{that focuses on the}} [...] "perils of the governess's intense social relationships rather than the physical terrors of the situation". According to Murray, <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> was written to challenge Janeway's imagination and not her intellect. She added that the series approached Janeway's romance with the fictional Lord Burleigh as a serious [...] "exercise posing psychological and moral questions" [...] for the audience and characters to explore during the episodes. Van Riper included Janeway {{as an example of how}} fictional female captains are more likely to create or maintain romantic relationships during their voyages than fictional men. Taylor viewed the holonovel, specifically its use in [...] "Persistence of Vision", as central to Janeway's character development as it allowed her to move on from her previous relationship with her fiancée Mark Johnson (Stan Iver). During a discussion of her approach to Janeway's personal life, Taylor wrote: [...] "We cannot put her into romantic situations until she decides he has given her up for dead and moved on, and the only wise thing for her to do is the same". Murray noted that Janeway shares many features with the character Jane Eyre, particularly [...] "a strong resistance to being bullied, a willingness to stand on principle, and the courage to face fear and isolation head-on". She wrote that the holonovel allows viewers to see [...] "unexpected sides of familiar characters". Murray called Janeway a [...] "person of Victorian integrity" [...] and described the holonovel as opening a channel of exploration that brings her [...] "the benefit of self-knowledge" [...] in order to return her to [...] "the real world all the stronger".|$|E
500|$|Just before Dwight {{starts his}} fire simulation, {{he said his}} {{co-workers}} previously failed to listen because he made a presentation on <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>program</b> Microsoft PowerPoint, of which he said, [...] "PowerPoint is boring". Michael refers to Barack Obama, the first African American president of the United States, to Stanley while he is suffering a heart attack by shouting, [...] "Stanley! Barack is president! You are black! Stanley!" [...] A deleted scene further addresses Obama's election, with Michael praising the choice and Darryl, with Darryl half-jokingly telling the Caucasian office workers what will change for them (they {{no longer have to}} pretend to like jazz, and Morgan Freeman won't get any more acting work because [...] "he's more for you guys"). Michael calls an employee from the Red Cross, an international humanitarian movement, to conduct a lesson about CPR. The instructor suggests they pump the heart to the tune of [...] "Stayin' Alive", a disco song by the pop band, the Bee Gees, but Michael mixes the song up with [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by Gloria Gaynor. At the end of the lesson, Dwight cuts the face off the CPR dummy and places it on his face in the manner of Hannibal Lecter, a fictional cannibalistic serial killer who cut the face off a man and wore it as a mask in the 1991 thriller film, The Silence of the Lambs. Watching Mrs. Albert Hannaday, Andy says the Cloris Leachman character was originally supposed to be played by the much younger actress, Nicole Kidman, and the last-minute replacement prompted a minor overhaul in the film's script. The songs [...] "You Make My Dreams Come True" [...] by Hall and Oates, [...] "All Out of Love" [...] by the soft rock duo Air Supply, [...] "Have a Little Faith in Me" [...] by singer-songwriter John Hiatt, and [...] "Lady" [...] by Little River Band play during scenes in Mrs. Albert Hannaday.|$|E
