5|$|Since winning {{back-to-back}} Shields in 2006 and 2007, {{the club}} failed {{to qualify for}} the MLS Cup Playoffs five years in a row. During this stretch, United's lone major title came in 2008, when they won the U.S. Open Cup. In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns, United faltered at the tail-end of each season, ultimately causing them <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the playoffs. They had a poor 2010 MLS season, winning only six matches, drawing four and losing 20. In 2011, United again failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in the second to last week of the campaign. In 2012, United returned to the playoffs {{for the first time in}} five years, clinching a berth in the second-to-last week of the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{favorite}} for qualification {{in both the}} 100m and 200m at the US Olympic Trials, Gay put in a strong performance in the heats. After a misjudgement {{in the first round}} almost caused him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> qualification, Gay resolved to step up his pace, and he won the 100m quarter-final with a US record-setting run of 9.77s. Breaking Maurice Greene's nine-year-old record, this made Gay the third fastest 100m sprinter ever, after rivals Bolt and Powell. In the final the following day, Gay finished first in a wind-aided 9.68s (+4.1m/s). This was the fastest ever 100m time under any conditions, bettering the 9.69s record which Obadele Thompson had set 12 years earlier. The 200m event was a significant setback for Gay as he suffered a hamstring injury in the qualifiers and was subsequently ruled out of the event for the Olympics. The injury persisted for several weeks and he dropped out of track meetings in order to recover in time for the Olympics.|$|E

50|$|Mollema {{made his}} Grand Tour {{debut in the}} Giro d'Italia in which he made a good {{impression}} but fell short of a top 10 classification and winning the young rider competition, partially due <b>to</b> <b>missing</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a break-away of 50 riders in {{which a lot of}} direct opponents gained a 12 minutes lead.

The forward scored 10 goals overall in his first season, but, with Wayne Rooney in good form and Ruud van Nistelrooy back in the team after injury, was relegated to the bench.|$|E
25|$|Weeks {{after the}} Olympics, he lost to Wariner {{by a large}} margin at the Weltklasse Zürich, {{although}} Wariner's winning time of 43.82 seconds was still slower than Merritt's Olympic winning run. Merritt secured his fourth win over Wariner that season at the 2008 IAAF World Athletics Final. Although the two had both beaten each other that season, Merritt had won all the most important races, ending the season as the Olympic and American champion over 400 m as well as taking home the World Athletics Final payday. He opted <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the 2009 indoor season to focus on improving his running and technique.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} four years, already in his forties, he studied at the {{theology}} faculty of the National University of Athens, Greece, obtaining an undergraduate degree. Registered as Gerasimos Saffirinos, he was presenting himself as an ardent Philhellene to his teachers. Safirin also asked to be examined ahead of other students: at the time, he had been promised {{a seat on the}} Synod, and did not want <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the opportunity. The professors refused to do so without explicit permission from the Romanian Metropolitan Iosif Gheorghian, who refused to grant it. Safirin returned home in 1894, and until 1899, was again employed by Râmnic seminary, this time as a teacher of Latin.|$|E

25|$|Uli Schmidt, son of Louis Schmidt, was {{the prince}} of hookers and a genius of a player. A medical doctor by {{profession}} he was a favourite amongst all Bulls supporters, even when leaving Northerns for arch-enemies Transvaal {{at the beginning of}} the 1993 season. Thanks to his fiery performance and expertise he played many times for his province and country and was desperately unlucky <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the 1995 World Cup year due to a neck injury. If he had been able to play test rugby on a regular basis especially during the late 1980s, he would probably have been regarded as one of the world's greatest hookers. Legendary All Black lock, Colin Meads, in fact described Schmidt as the world's best hooker.|$|E
25|$|In Chelsea's FA Cup fifth-round {{match against}} Newcastle United in the {{following}} season, goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini was sent off late in the match, and with no substitutions remaining, Johnson went in goal. Although he did not concede, Newcastle were already 1–0 up and went through {{at the expense of}} Chelsea. He picked up a winner's medal when he came on as a second-half substitute for Chelsea in the 2005 League Cup Final, a match which Chelsea won 3–2 against Liverpool after extra time. He also made 16 appearances, enough for a medal, as they won the Premier League title in this season, but he was <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a medal for their success in the next season after managing only four appearances in the league.|$|E
25|$|Venables became {{manager of}} Australia in November 1996, {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Eddie Thomson.

His side swept through the Oceania World Cup qualifiers, but were beaten in a play-off by Iran on away goals, a match {{often referred to as}} the most tragic moment in Australian football history. With the team having drawn 1–1 in Tehran, Australia led the second leg 2–0 at half time, but the partisan crowd were left stunned when they conceded two late goals <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> qualification for the 1998 World Cup on away goals. Venables decided to quit the Socceroos as the National Governing Body had bank-rolled the Federation in the hope of reaching their first World Cup since 1974.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the fourteen-year-old Santos ran the 400m in 53 {{seconds and}} he decided to take the sport seriously after running at the {{national}} schools championships. His performances attracted the attention of José Ludwig Rubio, a Dominican coach and former president of the national association. The following year he ran a personal best of 47.58 seconds and made his international debut at the 2009 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships. He was eliminated {{in the first round of}} the 400m and was impressed at the speed of fellow Caribbean athlete Rondell Bartholomew. He broke his first national junior record at the competition as part of the Dominican 4×400 metres relay team, running a time of 3:13.18 minutes. A visa problem caused him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the 2009 World Youth Championships in Athletics.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, playoffs to {{determine}} promotion places were introduced for the 1986–87 season {{so that more}} clubs remained eligible for promotion closer {{to the end of}} the season, and at the same time to aid in the reduction over two years of the number of clubs in the First Division from 22 to 20. For the first two seasons, the playoffs were contested between the lowest placed team to avoid automatic relegation and three highest placed teams <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> automatic promotion in the division below, before it was altered from the 1988–89 season to include just the four clubs who had missed out on automatic promotion in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions. 1986–87 was indeed the first season of the decade where Football League attendances increased, helped by improved economic conditions and falling unemployment nationally.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Buffett married Susan Thompson at Dundee Presbyterian Church. The {{next year}} {{they had their}} first child, Susan Alice. In 1954, Buffett {{accepted}} a job at Benjamin Graham's partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (about $ today). There he worked closely with Walter Schloss. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> big winners that had other appealing features. That same year the Buffetts had their second child, Howard Graham. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 (about $ million today) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd.|$|E

25|$|At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Barbados and {{the other}} West Indian teams participated {{individually}} in the cricket tournament, held {{for the first and}} only time. Barbados easily defeated Northern Ireland and Bangladesh, but lost to South Africa in their final group-stage match <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> qualification for the semi-finals. The team's participation in the Commonwealth Games coincided with a period of superiority at domestic first-class level – from the 1994–95 season through to the 2003–04 season, the team won six out of ten titles. Internationally, Floyd Reifer captained the West Indies in a 2009 Test series against Bangladesh, the first Barbadian to do so since Desmond Haynes in 1990. However, his appointment was only temporary, coming during a players' strike. Jason Holder, who was appointed Test captain in 2015, is the most recent Barbadian to serve as captain of the West Indies.|$|E

Wilkinson was then selected to tour Australia with the elite squad but was not selected as first choice fly half, nevertheless Wilkinson landed the winning points in the second test between England and Australia. Injury forced him <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the 2010 autumn internationals, in the process losing his position as the all-time leading points scorer in test rugby to Dan Carter. However, Wilkinson reclaimed the record during the 2011 Six Nations Championship, a tournament during which he came off the bench in each of England's five games.

However, the Thunder lost their following four games and it looked as if they were set <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the finals. In their final game of the 2015–16 Big Bash League season, the Thunder defeated the Sixers for only the second time in their history to book a finals berth. The Thunder faced the Adelaide Strikers at Adelaide Oval in the first semi final, winning convincingly. The Thunder then faced the Stars in the Finals the Melbourne Stars. The final was played at Melbourne Cricket Ground on 24 January 2016 and resulted in the Thunder's defeat of the Melbourne Stars. The Sydney Thunder franchise also swept the titles as the women's team won the inaugural women's title hours ago on the same ground by the same margin with the same number of balls remaining (3 wickets with 3 balls remaining). The men's game also featured a battle of two captains as brothers Michael and David Hussey went against each other on their mother's birthday.|$|E
