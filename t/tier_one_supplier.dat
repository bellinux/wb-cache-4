40|$|AbstractOver {{recent years}} a few {{automobile}} manufacturers, that ca be OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer, have migrated or expanded their activities to non-traditional regions of Brazil seeking gains in productivity. With this geographic {{change of the}} industry, traditional <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> <b>suppliers</b> have also relocated or expanded their activities to new sites seeking better results of quality, costs and time. The dependency of <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> <b>suppliers</b> in transporting parts and components from distant places may result in unfavorable conditions due to production and logistics costs, which lead to non-optimized levels of quality and generally poor business results. This paper proposes a model for development of the supply chain {{in order to increase}} the competitiveness of potential local <b>suppliers</b> of <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> and OEM companies (tier 2 + suppliers). The model, applied to the automotive sector, encompasses the identification of demand, analysis of availability, identification of technological partners, and development of business plans. The described model is applicable to any industrial enterprise that seeks to improve quality, costs, and financial results while reinforcing the sustainability within a product's life cycle...|$|R

Less emphasis was set on organizing in an efficient way the installation supply chain. Considering <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> <b>suppliers,</b> which deliver their products to a building site for assembly, manufacturing should be driven according to the demand needed on the building site. Finished parts should be transported to the construction site Just in Time (JIT) with short lead times and low stocks in the fabrication shop and on-site.

Therefore, an on-site oriented capacity regulation for fabrication shops is needed for ETO companies...|$|R
40|$|Passenger airbags are {{currently}} {{designed for the}} optimal support of a 50 -percentile adult in a crash, {{reducing the risk of}} severe injury for a maximum range of occupants. However, such a fixed-level, high-energy airbag deployment can be extremely dangerous for very small occupants, for example the 5 -percentile woman or children in infant seats. For this very reason, new standards such as FMVSS 208 (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208) include differentiated airbag deployment strategies according to occupant classification. IEE, Luxemburg, develops and manufactures such occupant classification systems. An example of which are the sensor mats made by IEE, which <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> automotive <b>suppliers</b> use globally for their seating systems. These mats measure the two-dimensional pressure profile in the seat area, and deliver these values for a pattern recognition algorithm as basis for occupant classification. An innovative development project, currently being conducted by the company, is an optical system which can provide three-dimensional information on the occupant, enabling highly differentiated classification. This system is projected to become commercial by 2007...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss the main {{strategic}} motivation for an automotive supplier: being a <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> <b>supplier</b> vis-à-vis their clients. Our central argument is that a high rank in the suppliers ’ pyramid does not guarantee both suitable level of performance and sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, being in a tier one position does not prevent significant benefit gaps between competitors. This goes against the common belief assuming that tier one suppliers have similar profiles just because they have been selected under the same criterion. Indeed, the traditional and pyramidal classification of suppliers, based on their tier regards to the OEM, implies that firms from similar ranks have common profiles. Our theoretical background is the strategic groups approach. We propose to fit the notion of tier of suppliers with that of strategic groups. Our empirical study was conducted in the French automotive component industry on the overall 1675 firms. Our data were sourced for the annual survey (EAE 1999) conducted by the service of industrial studies and statistics of the French ministry of industry (SESSI). We conducted two principal component analyses to define the performance indicators. Then a hierarchical classification helped us to regroup the suppliers into different clusters...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a part of the Supply Chain 2020 {{research}} project which seeks to study best practices in supply chain management in multiple industries in order to develop a deeper understanding of key principles and practices characterizing the creation of excellent supply chains through a long-term research agenda. This thesis addresses the first phase of the research by concentrating on the aerospace industry and by focusing on Rolls-Royce through a case study. The objective of the thesis is to conduct an exploratory study of the best practices in supply chain management in the aircraft engine manufacturing industry, and how these practices impact the competitive positioning of an engine manufacturer within the industry. The analysis involves a broad review of the current state and future directions of the aerospace industry by tracing the key factors shaping its evolution and by identifying the major strategic forces that would influence its future. Within this general industry context, the thesis analyzes Rolls-Royce's position in the industry as a leading aircraft engine manufacturer and presents a focused study of Rolls-Royce's supply chain management practices. (cont.) In particular, the thesis involves a deeper exploration of the aircraft engine manufacturing business segment of Rolls-Royce and strives to understand the company's supply chain management practices, by examining the role of major factors that have proven crucial to effective supply chain management within the company. The thesis also presents more specific case study examples that track the implementation and results of major supply chain management initiatives. Finally, the supply chain design and management practices are analyzed from the perspective of their role in the company's business strategy. This is accomplished by employing a number of business strategy frameworks to understand the key factors that determine the competitiveness of a <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> <b>supplier</b> in the aerospace industry, such as Rolls- Royce, and by examining how those factors have affected Rolls-Royce's supply chain management strategies and practices. by Mohit Tiwari.

40|$|A {{technical}} and design evaluation {{was carried out}} to meet DOE hydrogen fuel targets for 2010. These targets consisted of a system gravimetric capacity of 2. 0 kWh/kg, a system volumetric capacity of 1. 5 kWh/L and a system cost of $ 4 /kWh. In compressed hydrogen storage systems, {{the vast majority of}} the weight and volume is associated with the hydrogen storage tank. In order to meet gravimetric targets for compressed hydrogen tanks, 10, 000 psi carbon resin composites were used to provide the high strength required as well as low weight. For the 10, 000 psi tanks, carbon fiber is the largest portion of their cost. Quantum Technologies is a <b>tier</b> <b>one</b> hydrogen system <b>supplier</b> for automotive companies around the world. Over the course of the program Quantum focused on development of technology to allow the compressed hydrogen storage tank to meet DOE goals. At the start of the program in 2004 Quantum was supplying systems with a specific energy of 1. 1 - 1. 6 kWh/kg, a volumetric capacity of 1. 3 kWh/L and a cost of $ 73 /kWh. Based on the inequities between DOE targets and Quantum’s then current capabilities, focus was placed first on cost reduction and second on weight reduction. Both of these were to be accomplished without reduction of the fuel system’s performance or reliability. Three distinct areas were investigated; optimization of composite structures, development of “smart tanks” that could monitor health of tank thus allowing for lower design safety factor, and the development of “Cool Fuel” technology to allow higher density gas to be stored, thus allowing smaller/lower pressure tanks that would hold the required fuel supply. The second phase of the project deals with three additional distinct tasks focusing on composite structure optimization, liner optimization, and metal...|$|R
