500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided {{he was going to make}} folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to start making knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E
500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there are so few of them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 3, 1950, Harvey's 26th birthday, {{he married}} Bernice [...] "Bea" [...] Brady, a Wichita native {{with whom he}} had {{performed}} in numerous KU theater productions. Immediately following the marriage, Harvey did a graduate study in drama during the 1950 summer session at the University of Denver, and then studied at the University of Colorado for a doctorate. [...] "I made it through summer school and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to go back to Kansas," [...] Harvey has said. He and his wife then returned to Lawrence and both landed jobs teaching theater, Harvey at KU and his wife at the local high school.|$|E
2500|$|Amos derived the album's {{title from}} the Hawaiian volcano goddess, Pele, with the [...] "boys" [...] {{representing}} {{the men in}} her life. [...] "First I wanted to sacrifice all these guys to the volcano goddess and roast them like marshmallows, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> {{they gave me a}} really wonderful gift," [...] Amos said of the title. Amos herself has described the album as a novel, as a [...] "story of the descent of a woman to gain her passion and gain her compassion," [...] chronicling a woman's self-discovery in a male-dominated world, looking for fragments of herself and being suppressed. Songs such as [...] "Blood Roses," [...] "Caught a Lite Sneeze", [...] "Hey Jupiter," [...] "Doughnut Song" [...] and [...] "Putting the Damage On" [...] deal directly with the aftermath of a break-up and a woman's reflection on the failed relationship.|$|E
2500|$|On May 19, 1936, Abe went {{shopping}} {{and saw a}} movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Omiya, a friend, and Ishida. She planned to commit suicide {{one week after the}} murder, and practiced necrophilia. [...] "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis." ...|$|E

60|$|Upon such a course, <b>then,</b> did <b>I</b> <b>decide,</b> and, {{with this}} end in view, I took my way towards the Auberge Royale, where His Majesty {{had told me}} that the Count was lodged.

60|$|Betty {{apparently}} enjoyed all this. I grieve to {{say that}} she {{was a bit of a}} coquette. I tried to cure her of this serious defect, but for once I found that I had undertaken something I could not accomplish. In vain I lectured, Betty only laughed; in vain I gravely rebuked, Betty only flirted more vivaciously than before. Men might come and men might go, but Betty went on forever. I endured this sort of thing for a year and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that it was time to interfere seriously. I must find a husband for Betty...my fatherly duty would not be fulfilled until I had...nor, indeed, my duty to society. She was not a safe person to have running at large.|$|E

50|$|Growing up, Novella did {{not always}} want to be a physician. In an {{interview}} for the Books and Ideas podcast he said, I think I entertained various career ideas. When I was growing up I thought about being a lawyer {{for a while and then}} by the time I went to college, I knew I wanted to go into a science background and I did premed in undergraduate school. So certainly by <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> that that’s probably what I wanted to do.

The bear went into a small clump of spruces and stayed there a little while. Tantalizing moments! The hounds were hot upon his trail, still working to and fro in the oak thicket. I judged scarcely a mile separated them from the bear. Again he disappeared behind a little bush. Remembering that five pairs of sharp eyes could see me from the points above I stood up and waved my red cap. I waved it wildly as a man waves a red flag in moments of danger. Afterward R.C. said he saw me plainly and understood my action. Again the bear had showed, this time on an open slide, where he had halted. He was looking across the canyon while I waved my cap.|$|E

I stopped the gas engine, felt for and stroked the beast, which was still insensible, and then, being tired, left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed. I {{found it hard to}} sleep. I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff, going over the experiment over and over again, or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me, until everything, the ground I stood on, vanished, and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets. About two, the cat began miaowing about the room. I tried to hush it by talking to it, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to turn it out. I remember the shock I had when striking a light--there were just the round eyes shining green--and nothing round them. I would have given it milk, but I hadn't any. It wouldn't be quiet, it just sat down and miaowed at the door. I tried to catch it, with an idea of putting it out of the window, but it wouldn't be caught, it vanished. Then it began miaowing {{in different parts of the}} room. At last I opened the window and made a bustle. I suppose it went out at last. I never saw any more of it.|$|E
6000|$|If the {{appointment}} {{was not present}} fortune, {{it was the beginning}} of the best luck I have had in the world, and I am glad to owe it all to those friends of my verse, who could have been no otherwise friends of me. They were then beginning very early careers of distinction which have not been wholly divided. Mr. Nicolay could have been about twenty-five, and Mr. Hay nineteen or twenty. No one dreamed as yet of the opportunity opening to them in being so constantly near the man whose life they have written, and with whose fame they have imperishably interwrought their names. I remember the sobered dignity of the one, and the humorous gaiety of the other, and how we had some young men's joking and laughing together, in the anteroom where they received me, with the great soul entering upon its travail beyond the closed door. They asked me if I had ever seen the President, and I said that I had seen him at Columbus, the year before; but I could not say how much I should like to see him again, and thank him for the favor which I had no claim to at his hands, except such as the slight campaign biography I had written could be thought to have given me. That day or another, as I left my friends, I met him in the corridor without, and he looked at the space I was part of with his ineffably melancholy eyes, without knowing that I was the indistinguishable person in whose [...] "integrity and abilities he had reposed such special confidence" [...] as to have appointed him consul for Venice and the ports of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, though he might have recognized the terms of my commission if I had reminded him of them. I faltered a moment in my longing to address him, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that every one who forebore to speak needlessly to him, or to shake his hand, did him a kindness; and I wish I could be as sure of the wisdom of all my past behavior as I am of that piece of it. He walked up to the watercooler that stood in the corner, and drew himself a full goblet from it, which he poured down his throat with a backward tilt of his head, and then went wearily within doors. The whole affair, so simple, has always remained one of a certain pathos in my memory, and I would rather have seen Lincoln in that unconscious moment than on some statelier occasion.|$|E
5000|$|At Moi Airbase, {{he worked}} with {{world-class}} runners Paul Tergat and Wilson Boit Kipketer and, despite his disinterest in sport as a child, the two convinced Menjo to try his hand at running. He began to compete in various cross country and track meets at military level. He won a 5000 metres provincial race in 2004, gaining qualification into his first national championships. It was this race which sparked the Kenyan's interest: [...] "I realised I had potential in the distance and, from <b>then</b> on, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to specialise in it".|$|R
