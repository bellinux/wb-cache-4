5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> review panel.|$|E
5|$|To {{suggest that}} the BBC, forming opinion in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of England, has been an {{influence}} for good in any way, {{when you consider the}} criminality of large areas of London; when you consider the Mods and Rockers, and all those other things; when you consider the total moral underminings which have been taking place in England, much to all our distress, in the last fifteen to twenty years, the Hon. Member can hardly bring that up as an argument in favour of the freedom of broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|In one sense, all terma may be {{considered}} mind-termas, since the teaching associated is always inserted in <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practitioner; in other words the terma is always a direct transmission from <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vidyadhara towards <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tertön. The terma may also be held in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tertön and realised in a future incarnation at a beneficent time. A vision of a syllable or symbol may leaven <b>the</b> realisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latent terma in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tertön. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> hiding in <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> implies that <b>the</b> practitioner is to gain realisation in that life. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> terma concealment, a prophecy is generally made concerning {{the circumstances in which}} the teaching will be re-accessed. Especially in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> an earth-terma, this usually includes a description of locality, and may specify certain ritual tools or objects which are required to be present, and <b>the</b> identities <b>of</b> any assistants and consorts who are required to accompany or assist the tertön.|$|R

5|$|In Valinor, Fëanor, son of Finwë, and the {{greatest}} of the Noldor, created the Silmarils in which he stored {{a part of the}} light of the Two Trees that were lighting Valinor. After three ages in the Halls of Mandos, Melkor was released, feigning reform. He however spread his evil and started to poison <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves against the Valar. Eventually he killed Finwë and stole the Silmarils. Fëanor then named him Morgoth (S. The Black Enemy). Fëanor and his seven sons then swore to take the Silmarils back, and led a large army of the Noldor to Beleriand.|$|E
5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo {{announced that it would}} be sufficient to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza would take care of the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} the crusades were a {{response}} to Islam dates {{back as far as}} 12th-century historian William of Tyre, who began his chronicle with the fall of Jerusalem to Umar. Although the original Islamic conquests had taken place centuries before the First Crusade, more recent events, or atrocities, committed by the Muslims in their occupation of the Levant, would have been fresh in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Christians of the time. For example, in 1009 the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had been destroyed by the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah; Pope Sergius IV supposedly called for a military expedition in response, and in France, many Jewish communities were even attacked in a misdirected retaliation. Despite the Church's rebuilding after al-Hakim's death, and pilgrimages resuming, including the Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–1065, pilgrims continued to suffer attacks from local Muslims. Liberating the Sepulchre is often presented as motivation for the crusaders. In addition, the even more recent Turkish incursions into Anatolia and northern Syria were certainly viewed as devastating by Eastern Christian chroniclers, and it is plausible they were presented as such by the Byzantines to the Pope in order to solicit the aid of European Christians.|$|E

5|$|The Overmind is {{the center}} of the Zerg Swarm's hive mind society, created by the Xel'Naga as a single {{consciousness}} for their experiments on the Zerg. It is the antagonist of StarCraft, where it is voiced by Jack Ritschel; Paul Eiding voices the character in Wings of Liberty. At some point during its creation, it was secretly enslaved by the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, who implanted it with a directive to destroy the Protoss and bound the Zerg to a hive mind. The Overmind becomes aware of Xel'Naga, attacking and assimilating its masters. Through this, the Overmind learns of the existence of the Protoss and is determined to assimilate the fellow Xel'Naga-empowered species, believing this will result in perfection. To provide the necessary force to overcome the Protoss, the Overmind targets the psionic potential of the Terrans for assimilation. He also assimilated Sarah Kerrigan so as to create a weapon to free the Zerg from the control of his Dark Master. The Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds, eventually leading to Zeratul assassinating the cerebrate Zasz. Zasz's death momentarily links <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Overmind and Zeratul, allowing Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet's surface. Following a lengthy and costly campaign on Aiur, Tassadar harnesses the energies of the dark templar to strike at the Overmind directly, disintegrating it.|$|E
