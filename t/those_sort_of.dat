500|$|Financial {{concerns}} {{were raised in}} 2009 over {{the cost of the}} new leisure complex, and because of a change in the source of student funding from the Learning and Skills Council to Local Education Authorities. The college was facing a shortfall of at least £500,000 in 2009 and its auditors expressed doubt about RNC's ability to continue as a going concern. In response Ian Pickford said that much of thePoint4's costs had been paid for through donations and that the shortfall issue was being addressed through cutbacks, including some redundancies. Of the auditors' concerns he said; [...] "I think post the banking crisis a lot of auditors are incredibly nervous about making bland statements in terms of the future of organisations and therefore they frequently now put <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> caveats in to protect their position going forward." ...|$|E

They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween." [...] American band Wilco wrote and recorded [...] "Just a Kid". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in [...] Tweedy said, [...] "I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness {{at the bottom of the}} sea as 'advanced darkness' How could I not write a song for this film? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block." [...] Avril Lavigne recorded the series' theme for the soundtrack. Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Motörhead, singing [...] "You Better Swim" [...] (a derivative of their 1992 song [...] "You'd Better Run"); Prince Paul ("Prince Paul's Bubble Party"); Ween ("Ocean Man"), and the Shins ("They'll Soon Discover", partially written in 2001).|$|E

2500|$|In December 2005 Owen's {{cherished}} Fender Telecaster Deluxe {{electric guitar}} and his 1930s Dobro Kluson slide guitar – {{referred to in}} Kelly's song – were stolen. Owen told The Ages Selma Milovanovic that [...] "My sound on those instruments is what I'm known for. <b>Those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> guitars are very, very rare, they are unique. It's like having your heart ripped out. It's horrible". Some days later, the thief was caught but had on-sold the goods, Owen then paid a third-party $200 to buy back his guitars.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{decades after}} her Grammy, Reddy {{discussed}} the song's iconic status: [...] "I think it came along {{at the right}} time. I'd gotten involved in the Women's Movement, {{and there were a}} lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> things. All the women in my family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the Depression and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn't see myself as being dainty," [...] she said.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, {{the success}} of her {{performance}} in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Four in a Million led to many offers; one being the chance to move into television comedy. The BBC was quick to cast her in the BBC Scotland sketch comedy programme A Kick Up the Eighties. The network {{was so impressed with}} her that it offered her her own series. She initially turned down the offer. [...] "My first reaction was you must be joking, as women are treated so shoddily in comedy. Big busty barmaids and all <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> cliches just bore me rigid." [...] She also had reservations {{due to a lack of}} female contemporaries. [...] "At that time English women were't really allowed to be funny on television. I didn't have any examples. I mean, I didn't have a Gilda Radner, Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin. I mean, my only point of reference, quite honestly, was the Benny Hill girls." [...] Ullman got into her performing arts school by doing an impersonation of Lily Tomlin. Eventually a deal was made with the proviso that she would get to choose the show's writers, have script approval, and choose the costumes. Three of a Kind, co-starring comedians Lenny Henry and David Copperfield, debuted in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, but she was a great enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I know <b>those</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> women. They ring the bell and tell you to put a lump of coal on the fire." ...|$|E
