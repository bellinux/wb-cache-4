5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars <b>to</b> <b>accurately</b> judge how much time this saved.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{preliminary}} astrometric measurements {{made by the}} Hipparcos probe {{suggested the}} orbit of 47 UMa b is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to {{the plane of the}} sky, implying the planet's true mass is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter. However, subsequent analysis suggested the Hipparcos measurements were not precise enough <b>to</b> <b>accurately</b> determine the orbits of substellar companions, and the inclination and true mass remain unknown.|$|E

5|$|MAR {{operated}} in two modes, surveillance, and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5seconds. Returns were fed into systems that automatically extracted {{the range and}} velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns in an effort <b>to</b> <b>accurately</b> determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>accurately</b> {{plan the}} {{brachytherapy}} procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed {{to understand the}} characteristics of the tumour. In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the tumour and its relation to surrounding tissues and organs. These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The data from many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the tumour and the surrounding tissues.|$|E

5|$|To address {{concerns}} that {{the sound of the}} Hammond was not rich enough <b>to</b> <b>accurately</b> mimic a pipe organ, the model BC was introduced in December 1936. It included a chorus generator, in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note. The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this. Production of the old Model A cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.|$|E
