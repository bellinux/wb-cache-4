5|$|Argus had her genesis in the Admiralty's desire {{during the}} First World War for an {{aircraft}} carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but {{had no way to}} recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore had proposed to the Admiralty {{an aircraft carrier}} design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners Conte Rosso and Giulio Cesare had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. Conte Rosso was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of Giulio Cesare, and <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>began</b> work on converting the ship.|$|E
