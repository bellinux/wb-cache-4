5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly {{as far from the}} left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} The Message Given <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> Extraterrestrials (now republished as Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers 2006 [...] ), Claude Vorilhon claims that on 13 December 1973, {{he found a}} {{spacecraft}} shaped like a flattened bell that landed inside Puy de Lassolas, a volcano near {{the capital city of}} Auvergne. A 25,000-year-old human-like extraterrestrial inside the spacecraft named Yahweh said that Elohim was the name that primitive people of Earth called members of his extraterrestrial race—who were seen as [...] "those who came from the sky". Yahweh explained that Earth was originally void of life, with thick clouds and shallow seas, but the Elohim came, broke apart the clouds, exposed the seas to sunlight, built a continent, and synthesized a global ecosystem. Solar astronomy, terraformation, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering allowed Elohim to adapt life to Earth's thermal and chemical makeup.|$|E
500|$|Bevin said he [...] "strongly disagreed" [...] {{with the}} Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage, continuing [...] "When {{the definition of}} marriage {{was put on the}} ballot 10 years ago, 74 percent of Kentuckians {{made it clear that they}} supported traditional marriage. Since that time, however, activist judges have chosen to ignore the will of the people, and to ignore the Constitutional principle of state's rights." [...] He then attacked Conway, who refused to appeal the 2014 federal court opinion that Kentucky's defense of marriage amendment violated the federal constitution: [...] "Jack Conway's failure to do his job and defend our laws in Kentucky disqualifies him from being elected to the office of Governor." [...] Conway responded that he [...] "used the discretion given <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> statute to inform Gov. Beshear and the citizens of the Commonwealth that I would not waste the scarce resources of this office pursuing a costly appeal that would not be successful." [...] Bevin contended that Conway's decision cost Kentucky taxpayers $2.3 million, citing the cost of private attorneys that Beshear hired to defend the amendment in Conway's place.|$|E

"The Best of Both Worlds" [...] is {{considered}} to be one of Cyrus' signature songs, introducing her to the music industry. > Review}}}|work=|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=October 4, 2009|first=Heather|last=Phares}} The song received some critical praise, noting that the song was written well, but the concept was [...] "weird". [...] "The Best of Both Worlds" [...] reached number ninety-two on the Billboard Hot 100, making the song only one of two television themes of the decade (the other being Leave It All <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> <b>by</b> Miranda Cosgrove) [...] to chart on the Hot 100, and achieved average commercial success internationally. The song reached its highest international chart peak position in the Irish Singles Chart, at number seventeen. A promotional music video for the song was taken from a recording of a concert performance. Cyrus promoted the song by performing it in several venues, including during the opening act for the Cheetah Girls' The Party's Just Begun Tour and as the closing number on her own first headlining concert tour of the same name. Cyrus' performances of the song on the Best of Both Worlds Tour were as herself, but when she performed the song on television, she did so in character as Hannah Montana.|$|E

2500|$|Mozart met Joseph Haydn in Vienna around 1784, {{and the two}} composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they {{sometimes}} played together in an impromptu string quartet. Mozart's six quartets dedicated to Haydn (K.387, K.421, K.428, K.458, K.464, and K.465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn's Opus 33 set from 1781. Haydn in 1785 told Mozart's father: [...] "I tell you before God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition." ...|$|E
