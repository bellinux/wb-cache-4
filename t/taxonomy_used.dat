2500|$|The <b>taxonomy</b> <b>used</b> here {{is based}} on the Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera and the Carabidae of the World Database. Other classifications, while {{generally}} agreeing with the division into a basal radiation of more primitive lineages and the more advanced group informally called [...] "Carabidae Conjunctae", differ in details. For example, the system used by the Tree of Life Web Project makes little use of subfamilies, listing most tribes as incertae sedis as to subfamily. Fauna Europaea, though, splits rather than lumps the Harpalinae, restricting them to what in the system used here is the tribe Harpalini.|$|E

More data used would result in more validity and give better clarification of taxonomic status. A lot of modern taxonomic data such as palynology, cytotaxonomy (cytology), chemical constituent (chemotaxonomy), isozyme and DNA sequencing were used recently.

30|$|In {{the black}} African countries, studies on {{mushrooms}} <b>taxonomy</b> <b>using</b> the molecular technique {{have not been}} widely investigated. In Kenya, Ojwang (2012) characterized seventy-one Pleurotus species collected from the wild whereas in Nigeria, literatures revealed that Oyetayo (2009, 2014), Bankole and Adekunle (2012) and Awala and Oyetayo (2015) have identified mushrooms. The samples were collected from Ekiti, Lagos, Ondo and Oyo states of the Southwestern Nigeria and characterized using the internal transcribed spacer—polymerase chain reaction ITS-PCR). Diversity of mushrooms abounds at ENPOST farm, Ilesa, Osun State, Southwest Nigeria. However, paucity of information regarding their <b>taxonomy</b> <b>using</b> genetic approach greatly limits optimal exploitation for diverse human benefits. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is {{the first of its kind}} in the region and it is in the light of this we aimed at investigating the variability of some wild mushrooms collected at the ENPOST farm, Ilesa, Southwest Nigeria using ITS regions.|$|R
