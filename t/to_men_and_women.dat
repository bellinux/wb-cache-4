5|$|The Order {{was open}} <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> and both genders were {{entitled}} companions. Until 1476, {{there were no}} limits {{on the number of}} companions to be admitted, but that year, with the new edition of the Order's statutes, the Duke limited the number of men to 60; unlimited women could be admitted. The editions of the Order's statutes, two in Latin and two in German, established similar requirements for membership. The Latin editions stipulated that the man be of noble birth—eight generations of noble grandparents—and of unblemished reputation; the German versions required that only four grandparents of the man be noble. Women were to be spouses of a companion; in the 1476 versions of the statutes, both Latin and German, female members of the Duchess' household could be admitted even if their husbands were not members or if the women were single, but were required to resign if they left the service of the Duchess. The exception to this clause provided for their continued membership if their husbands became companions of the order.|$|E

25|$|Some {{argue that}} {{overpopulation}} {{and lack of}} access to birth control leads to population increase to exceed food production and other resources. Better education for both men and women, and more control of their lives, reduces population growth due to family planning.

For men, short pants or sleeveless shirts are generally regarded as inappropriate. In some Conservative and Reform synagogues the dress code may be more lax, but still respectful.|$|E

25|$|The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 previews {{equal rights}} <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> however, the first legal {{formalization}} against domestic violence was published only 18 years after constitution. The Brazilian famous law, Lei Maria da Penha {{was the result}} of an international process led by Maria da Penha herself. A victim of domestic violence, Maria da Penha Fernandes, was shot at by her husband with a rifle, who also tried to electrocute her in the bathroom. As a consequence, she became paralytic and started a long battle in court to convict her husband. In the 1990s, Maria da Penha appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and, in 2001, she was able obtain justice and hold the Brazilian Government accountable for judicial tolerance of domestic violence. The commission also recommended that the Brazilian Government adopt more effective measures against women violence.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} who study sexual orientation {{argue that the}} concept may not apply similarly <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> A study of sexual arousal patterns found that women, when viewing erotic films which show female-female, male-male and male-female sexual activity (oral sex or penetration), have patterns of arousal which do not match their declared sexual orientations as well as men's. That is, heterosexual and lesbian women's sexual arousal to erotic films do not differ significantly by the genders of the participants (male or female) or {{by the type of}} sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). On the contrary, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to be more in line with their stated orientations, with heterosexual men showing more penis arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, and homosexual and bisexual men being more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Advertising in {{the decades}} leading up to World War II {{consisted}} primarily of full page, color magazine and newspaper advertisements. Many companies created slogans for their specific cigarettes and also gained endorsements from famous men and women. Some advertisements even contained children or doctors {{in their efforts to}} sway new customers to their specific brand. Much of these advertisements sought to make smoking appear fashionable and modern <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b> Also, since the health effects of smoking weren't entirely proven at this time, the only real opposing argument to smoking was made on moral grounds. However, there were still a substantial number of doctors and scientists who believed there was a health risk associated with smoking cigarettes. During World War II, cigarettes were included in American soldier's C-rations since many tobacco companies sent the soldiers cigarettes for free. Cigarette sales reached an all-time high at this point, as cigarette companies were not only able to get soldiers addicted to tobacco, but specific brands also found a new loyal group of customers as soldiers who smoked their cigarettes returned from the war.|$|E

25|$|University College, Bristol {{opened on}} Tuesday 10 October 1876 at 9.00 a.m. with a Mathematics lecture by W. R. Bousfield, who also lectured in higher maths an hour later. The charges {{for such a}} course were three guineas for two lectures each week during the Christmas and Easter terms; a student also had to pay 7s as an {{entrance}} fee to enroll. At its opening in 1876, two professors and five lecturers offered lectures in fifteen subject areas. The college was situated at 32 Park Row and was rented for £50 per annum. As requested by Jowett when giving money, the College was open <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> on the same basis (except in medicine), The College offered scholarships the most valuable of which was one in Chemistry worth £25. General scholarships of £15 were also available. Despite the label of 'University' however, the institution {{did not have the}} power to award degrees to its students. There were however links with the University of London which allowed the external sitting of these examinations and the Cambridge Local Higher Examinations useful for those who wished to become teachers.|$|E
25|$|The {{timeline}} of granting women's suffrage in Romania was gradual and complex, due to {{the turbulent}} historical period when it happened. The concept of universal suffrage for all men was introduced in 1918, and reinforced by the 1923 Constitution of Romania. Although this constitution {{opened the way for}} the possibility of women's suffrage too (Article 6), this did not materialize: the Electoral Law of 1926 did not grant women the right to vote, maintaining all male suffrage. Starting in 1929, women who met certain qualifications were allowed to vote in local elections. After the Constitution from 1938 (elaborated under Carol II of Romania who sought to implement an authoritarian regime) the voting rights were extended to women for national elections by the Electoral Law 1939, but both women and men had restrictions, and in practice these restrictions affected women more than men (the new restrictions on men also meant that men lost their previous universal suffrage). Although women could vote, they could be elected only in the Senate and not in the Chamber of Deputies (Article 4 (c)). (the Senate was later abolished in 1940). Due to the historical context of the time, which included the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu, there were no elections in Romania between 1940-1946. In 1946, Law no. 560 gave full equal rights <b>to</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> to vote and to be elected in the Chamber of Deputies; and women voted in the Romanian general election, 1946. The Constitution of 1948 gave women and men equal civil and political rights (Article 18). Until the collapse of communism in 1989, all the candidates were chosen by the communist party, and civil rights were merely symbolic under this authoritarian regime.|$|E
