5|$|In June 1942, the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics {{requested}} industry {{proposals for}} a new seaplane to replace the Kingfisher and Curtiss SO3C Seamew. The new aircraft was required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> landing gear as well as floats. Curtiss submitted a design on 1 August, and received a contract for two prototypes and five service-test aircraft on 25 August. The first flight of a prototype XSC-1 took place on 16 February 1944 at the Columbus, Ohio Curtiss plant. The first production aircraft were delivered in October 1944, and {{by the beginning of}} 1945 the single-seat Curtiss SC Seahawk floatplane began replacing the Kingfisher. Had the Montana class been completed, they would have arrived around the time of this replacement, and would likely have been equipped with the Seahawk for use in combat operations and seaborne search and rescue.|$|E
5|$|The party {{supports}} {{an increase}} in police forces, and more visible police on the streets. It wants to implement tougher punishments, especially for crime regarding violence and morality offences. The party also wants to establish an ombudsman for victims and relatives, as it believes today's supportive concern focus {{too much on the}} criminals rather than the victims. It wants the police <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> more non-lethal weapons, such as electroshock weapons. It also does not accept any use of religious or political symbols with the police uniform, and wants to expel foreign citizens who are convicted of crime with a frame of more than three months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} between 27 February and 25 April 1967. The budget was £275,000. At this time, Hammer was {{operating}} out of the Associated British Studios in Elstree, Borehamwood. However, a lack of space meant that production was relocated to the nearby MGM Borehamwood studio. There were no other productions working at the MGM Studios at this time so the Quatermass crew had full {{access to all the}} facilities of the studio. Roy Ward Baker was particularly pleased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> MGM's extensive backlot for the exteriors of the Underground station. The production team included many Hammer regulars, including production designer Bernard Robinson who, as an in-joke, incorporated a poster for Hammer's The Witches (1966) into the dressing of his set for the Hobbs End station. Another Hammer regular was special effects supervisor Les Bowie. Roy Ward Baker recalled he had a row with Bowie, who believed the film was entirely a special effects picture, when he tried to run the first pre-production conference. Bowie's contribution to the film included the Martian massacre scene, which was achieved with a mixture of puppets and live locusts, and model sequences of London's destruction, including the climactic scene of the crane swinging into the Martian apparition.|$|E

5|$|MacPaint 2.0 was {{released}} on January 11, 1988 by Claris. It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use up to nine documents simultaneously. The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with a non-movable window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10". Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents. MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris. MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint. Claris discontinued technical support for the original MacPaint in 1989. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the program.|$|E
5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts have been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E

25|$|One {{limitation}} of the K-SADS is that it requires extensive training to give properly, including observation techniques, score calibration, and re-checks to test inter-rater reliability. It is less commonly used in clinical practice, and requires more training <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> consistently than other more structured alternatives. The greater degree of clinical judgment required has also made the K-SADS less suitable for large epidemiological projects, which usually need to use interviewers with little prior clinical experience.|$|E

25|$|Often {{there is}} a {{noticeable}} difference between the perceived risk of becoming a victim of crime and the statistical probability.
