On his campaign strategy that election, McSlarrow said [...] "It {{would not be a}} community service to shut down this campaign, but I probably will not <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Moran."

2500|$|The {{concept of}} the show was not {{revealed}} in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. I may not have the solution, but at least I can hear and understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|The street {{violence}} in Germany had largely ceased {{in the period}} 13 April-15 June 1932 when the SA and SS had been banned, {{and it was only}} after Papen lifted the ban that street violence returned with a vengeance. [...] Riots resulted on the streets of Berlin, as a total of 461 battles between Communists and the SA took place, leading to 82 deaths on both sides. Papen took no responsibility for lifting the ban and blamed the Social Democratic Prussian minister-president Otto Braun for the violence, claiming with no real proof that Braun had ordered the Prussian police to support the Communists against the Nazis. Papen had been looking for a reason to take over Prussia right from the beginning of his Chancellorship, and only held back because he lacked a convincing excuse. On 11 July 1932, {{with the exception of the}} Labour Minister Schäffer, the entire cabinet voted to depose the Braun government provided that Papen could find a believable excuse, and on the next day, the Interior Minister Baron Wilhlem von Gayl found that excuse, reporting he heard a rumor that the Social Democrats and Communists were planning a merger. The fact that Social Democrats and Communists were engaging in street battles, which might suggest that this rumor was just that, was disregarded and Papen promptly visited Hindenburg at his estate at Neudeck to ask for and receive a decree allowing the Reich government to take over the Prussian government. In this meeting with Hindenburg, Papen did not <b>talk</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the alleged plans for a SPD-KPD merger, instead saying that the decree was necessary because the Reich and Prussian governments should be headed by the same man as was the case in Imperial Germany. [...] On 20 July 1932, Papen launched a coup against the centre-left coalition government of Prussia, which was dominated by the Social Democrats (the so-called Preußenschlag). The use of the police apparatus in the Prussian [...] "coup" [...] on 20 July 1932 is described by historians Carsten Dams and Michael Stolle as [...] "the decisive breach on the path towards the Third Reich." [...] Berlin was put on military shutdown and Papen sent men to arrest the Prussian authorities, whom he accused with no evidence of being in league with the Communists. Hereafter, Papen declared himself commissioner of Prussia by way of an emergency decree which he elicited from Hindenburg, further weakening the democracy of the Weimar Republic. In Germany, the Reich government made laws, but the Länder governments were responsible for enforcing them as the Reich government had no police force of its own. When Prussia was ruled by Social Democrats, Paragraph 175, which made homosexuality illegal was not enforced as the SPD had long argued for the legalization of homosexuality. With the Preußenschlag, and with Papen serving as the Commissioner for Prussia, this changed as Papen ordered the Prussian police to start enforcing Paragraph 175 and to crack down on [...] "sexual immorality" [...] by banning nude bathing, pornography, and nude dancing together with a law ordering women not to wear [...] "suggestive" [...] clothing in public, though Papen did not ban soliciting by prostitutes as he had promised to. Despite his very acrimonious split with the Zentrum, Papen still had hopes of having the Zentrum support his government, and cracking on [...] "sexual immorality" [...] in Prussia offered a possible way of winning support from the Catholic church, which supported the Zentrum. But the same time, Papen wished to trade a full scale crackdown in exchange for the Zentrum supporting his government, which explained why Papen's crackdown was not as harsh as many Catholic conservatives would have liked. Papen had hopes in the summer of 1932 of attracting support in the Reichstag of a [...] "black-brown" [...] coalition of the Zentrum and the NSDAP.|$|E
