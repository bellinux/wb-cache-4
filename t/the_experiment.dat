5|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events. The repetition of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> happened in February 1955.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{rejection}} {{within the}} scientific community, MacDougall's experiment popularized {{the idea that}} the soul has weight, and specifically that it weighs 21 grams.

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time}} of death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the accordion float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> is repeated, however, he suggested that the accordion feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick achieved with one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E

5|$|The Dubna team {{repeated}} <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> in 2012, creating seven {{atoms of}} element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced {{after some time}} when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team repeated the Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.|$|E
5|$|The Schiehallion {{experiment}} was an 18th-century experiment {{to determine the}} mean density of the Earth. Funded {{by a grant from}} the Royal Society, it was conducted in the summer of 1774 around the Scottish mountain of Schiehallion, Perthshire. <b>The</b> <b>experiment</b> involved measuring the tiny deflection of a pendulum due to the gravitational attraction of a nearby mountain. Schiehallion was considered the ideal location after a search for candidate mountains, thanks to its isolation and almost symmetrical shape. One of the triggers for <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> were anomalies noted during the survey of the Mason–Dixon Line.|$|E
5|$|The magician John Nevil Maskelyne {{also criticized}} {{the design of}} <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> for taking place under a table. The {{psychologist}} Millais Culpin wrote <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> was not scientific and questioned why <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> was done under the table instead of in a more convenient position on top of it. Before the accordion experiment with Crookes, Home had performed the accordion feat for over fifteen years under various conditions but always under his control. It was reported by sitters and Crookes that Home's accordion played only two pieces, Home Sweet Home and The Last Rose of Summer. Both contain only one-octave.|$|E

5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that <b>the</b> <b>experiment</b> did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. <b>The</b> <b>experiment</b> described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
