5|$|It {{is easier}} to attack than to defend. A {{defending}} mistake can have bigger consequences <b>than</b> <b>an</b> attacking mistake. Thus, the defender {{needs to be more}} precise, which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker.|$|E

5|$|According to Angela Davis, neutron {{activation}} analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur's fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C. did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200yards (183m) away, he did not report Foerster's presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster's involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour later.|$|E
5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather <b>than</b> <b>an</b> intellectual level.|$|E

5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the interior of the building.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather <b>than</b> <b>an</b> intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
50|$|Three pawns {{are likely}} to be more useful <b>than</b> <b>a</b> knight in the endgame, but in the middlegame, a knight is often more powerful. Two minor pieces are {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single rook, and two rooks are slightly stronger <b>than</b> <b>a</b> queen.|$|R

5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} twenty-eight Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. They {{are known for}} being more violent <b>than</b> <b>an</b> average Simpsons episode and contain several {{different}} trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. Quite often the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows.

5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region {{of the rich and}} influential in Rome, and the location of many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities.

5|$|At 07:30 on 15 December, two {{companies}} of the Carleton and York Regiment attacked. After little more <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour of fighting, however, the Canadians {{were forced to}} call the attack off. In the afternoon, the two heavily depleted companies of the Royal 22e Régiment fought off a large German counterattack on Casa Berardi, with the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery firing 5,398 rounds in support of Canadian forces.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic problem}} with this is that natural {{selection}} calls for the slow accumulation of changes, where a new phyla would take longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> new class which would take longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> new order, which would take longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> new family, which would take longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> new genus would take longer <b>than</b> emergence of <b>a</b> new species [...] but the apparent occurrence of high-level taxa without precedents is perhaps implying unusual evolutionary mechanisms.|$|R
