5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E

5|$|There is one known {{planet in}} the orbit of WASP-44: WASP-44b. The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass of 0.889 Jupiters. Its radius is 1.14 times that of Jupiter. WASP-44b orbits its host star every 2.4238039 days at a {{distance}} 0.03473 AU, approximately 3.47% the mean distance between the Earth and Sun. With an orbital inclination of 86.02º, WASP-44b has an orbit <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> almost edge-on to its host star with respect to Earth. WASPA-44b's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.036, indicating a mostly circular orbit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot {{be used to identify}} them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the most ancient <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 {{are present in the}} decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes are present in a single decay chain).|$|E

After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> {{in the basement of the}} parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
