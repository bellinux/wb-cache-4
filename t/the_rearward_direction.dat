40|$|The {{aircraft}} {{met with}} an incident on March 23, 2006. On strip {{examination of the}} engine, one of the I stage compressor rotor blades was found dislodged and lying in the air intake. It was reported {{that in addition to}} this, one more blade had fractured in the airfoil section. The remaining blades of I stage were with the disc and were mechanically damaged to varying extent. The dislodged blade (No. 5) and the fractured blade (No. 24) were forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Two locking pins, one belonging to blade No. 5 and the other belonging to blade No. 24, were also sent for analysis with the following queries. (a) 	Whether or not blade No. 24 failed by fatigue? (b) 	Whether or not blade No. 5 got dislodged due to failure of blade No. 24 ? If not, what was the reason for dislodgement of blade No. 5 ? (c) 	In a normal situation, the blade sliding is expected to be in the forward direction. Why in this case, the blade No. 5 sliding was in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction?</b> The investigation was carried out with respect to (a) and (b) and the findings were reported (refer NAL Report No. FA-MT- 995 - 05 - 2006) with the following conclusions [...] (a) 	Fractographic study confirmed that the blade No. 24 had failed by sudden overload such as impact. There were no evidences of progressive failure like fatigue. (b) 	The dislodgement of blade No. 5 without any breakage is possible only when the locking mechanism fails. (c) 	Evidences suggest that the locking pin used for the blade No. 5 is 27. 0 mm in length against the specification of 32. 0 mm. This is as good as not locking the blade. It is, therefore, believed that this particular blade had dislodged from the disc due to this assembly error leading to subsequent damages in the engine. Subsequent to the above, NAL was requested to carry out investigation on additional components, namely, (a) dovetail portion of slot No. 5 from I stage rotor disc and (b) three blades of I stage rotor where half moon cuts were noticed with a view to establish the following. (a) 	Conformation of the blade sliding in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> (b) 	Nature of damages on the three blades supplied (whether or not due to FOD?) The necessary information, drawing, specification, photographs etc., were provided by the manufacturer for carrying out the investigation on the above components. The dovetail portion of the blade No. 5 and dovetail slot No. 5 on the rotor disc were examined to look for tell-tale marks, present if any, for conformation of the blade sliding in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> The damages on the pin No. 5 were also examined in detail in an effort to corroborate the tell-tale marks on the dovetail slot and the blade sliding direction. The dislodged blade i. e., blade No. 5 and the other I stage rotor blades were examined to look for damages that would have occurred during blade sliding and its ejection from the rotor disc. In the event of blade sliding in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction,</b> firstly, the blade is expected to have severe damages due to obstruction caused by the stator blades. In such a case, the blade would get fractured into pieces by the impact forces acted upon the blade by the stator blades. Secondly, once the blade moves out of the dovetail slot in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction,</b> it cannot come out into the air intake without damaging most of the I stage rotor blades. None of these were found to have occurred in the present case and hence, the evidences do not support the theory of blade sliding in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> The signatures left on the blade retaining pin and the dovetail slot No. 5 of the rotor disc were analyzed. These signatures also did not conform to the findings of the DI committee wherein it was established that the blade sliding was in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> On the contrary, there were adequate evidences to suggest that the blade No. 5 sliding was in the forward direction. A detailed account of the findings is submitted in this report. ...|$|E

Data obtained show that, {{in the absence of}} storm-relative mean winds in the stratosphere, the primary mode of excitation of gravity waves is by mechanical forcing owing to oscillatory updrafts. The stratospheric response consists of waves whose periods match the primary periods of the forcing. Due to the tendency of the oscillating updrafts to propagate toward the rear of the storm, gravity wave propagation is limited primarily to <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> Results suggest that squall-line-generated gravity waves arise from mechanical forcing rather than thermal effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} and calibration of a focused, continuous wave, coherent detection CO 2 lidar operated for {{the measurement of}} atmospheric backscatter coefficient, B(m), was examined. This instrument functions by transmitting infrared (10 micron) light into the atmosphere and collecting the light which is scattered in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction.</b> Two distinct modes of operation were considered. In volume mode, the scattered light energy from many aerosols is detected simultaneously, whereas in the single particle mode (SPM), the scattered light energy from a single aerosol is detected. The analysis considered possible sources of error {{for each of these}} two cases, and also considered the conditions where each technique would have superior performance. The analysis showed that, within reasonable assumptions, the value of B(m) could be accurately measured by either the VM or the SPM method. The understanding of the theory developed during the analysis was also applied to a pulsed CO 2 lidar.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} performance of pushrim-activated power-assisted wheelchairs (PAPAW) (iGLIDE, e-motion, Xtender) on national standards. DESIGN: Engineering performance and safety evaluation. SETTING: A Veteran Affairs and university-based research center. SPECIMENS: Nine PAPAWs. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Static, dynamic stability, brake effectiveness, maximum speed, acceleration, retardation, energy consumption, static, impact, and fatigue strength. RESULTS: There {{was no significant}} difference among the 3 models in forward stability. The iGLIDE was the most stable, whereas the e-motion was the least stable model in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> stability tests. All PAPAWs performed equally on the slopes of 3 degrees and 6 degrees in <b>the</b> forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>directions.</b> Braking distance was the highest for e-motion (5. 64 +/- 0. 28 m) and the lowest (1. 13 +/- 0. 03 m) for the iGLIDE in forward direction. The average equivalent cycles of all PAPAWs were 318, 292 +/- 112, 776. 6 cycles (n= 8) on the fatigue tests. All PAPAWs passed the impact and static strength tests. CONCLUSIONS: The standards of the American National Standards Institute and the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America could act as quality assurance tool for wheelchairs. The standards for wheelchairs were first approved in 1990; after 17 years, exceeding the minimum values in the standards would be a reasonable expectation...|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} triangular wing of {{aspect ratio}} 2. 53 having an airfoil section 3. 7 percent thick {{at the root}} and 5. 98 percent thick at the tip was designed {{in an attempt to}} improve the lift and drag characteristics of triangular wings. Free-flight drag and stability tests were made using rocket-propelled models equipped with the modified wing. The Mach number range of the test was from 0. 70 to 1. 37. Test results indicated the following: The lift-curve slope of wing plus fuselage approaches the theoretical value of wing alone at supersonic Mach numbers. The drag coefficient, based on total wing area, for wing plus interference was approximately 0. 0035 at subsonic Mach numbers and 0. 0080 at supersonic Mach numbers. The maximum shift in aerodynamic center for the complete configuration was 14 percent in <b>the</b> <b>rearward</b> <b>direction</b> from the forward position of 51. 5 percent of mean aerodynamic chord at subsonic Mach numbers. The variation of lift and moment with angle of attack was linear at supersonic Mach numbers for the range of coefficients covered in the test.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} MQP was {{to create}} a model of a dynamic seating system to be used to relieve {{discomfort}} that individuals often experience due to the rigid seating systems present in standard wheelchairs. Due to the rigidity of the seating system, individuals seated in wheelchairs may experience lumbar extensor spasticity, which is the involuntary extension of the lumbar muscles of the lower back. This causes discomfort and an inability to maintain an upright posture for the user of the wheelchair. A dynamic seating system can alleviate this problem by supporting the user and responding to any changes in the user’s position while seated in the wheelchair, while still maintaining the functionality of the seat. The design team modeled a system that would mimic the motion of an individual having a spasm in the lumbar muscles while seated in the wheelchair. Another objective of the design was to ensure that the seating system would force the user to return to his/her initial seating position after the completion of the spasm. The group considered the interactions between the user seated in the wheelchair and the wheelchair itself in order to model the points of contact as points of either rotational or translational motion. From there, three designs were selected for analysis of static stability on different angles of inclination in both <b>the</b> forward and <b>rearward</b> <b>directions.</b> By evaluating <b>the</b> forces due to the damper of the system at the point of attachment on the seat back and the spasm forces experienced at the shoulder blades, the design team determined the stability of the dynamic seating system in the different allowable positions. This project provided a model to determine the effect that the load on the wheelchair has on the dynamic movement of the seating system. This report also provided experimental values and analysis {{that can be used in}} future analysis and development of dynamic seating systems...|$|R
