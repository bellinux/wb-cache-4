5|$|The {{work was}} written {{as a direct}} {{response}} to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom Al-Maʿarri mocks for his religious views. In this work, the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period, contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in God can find salvation.|$|E
5|$|Crane's {{contract}} with Appleton {{allowed him to}} receive a flat ten percent royalty of all copies sold. However, the contract also stipulated {{that he was not}} to receive royalties from the books sold in Great Britain, where they were released by Heinemann in early 1896 as part of its Pioneer Series. In 1982, W. W. Norton & Company published a version of the novel based on Crane's original 1894 manuscript of 55,000 words. Edited by Henry Binder, this version is questioned by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> Crane made the original edits for the 1895 Appleton edition on his own accord. Since its initial publication, the novel has never gone out of print.|$|E

25|$|The {{closure of}} Women's Voice in 1982, reputedly because {{it tried to}} inject feminist {{thinking}} into SWP theoretical practice rather than gaining women members for the party, was a bitterly disputed action made by the leadership, a sharp debate taking place between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> {{the result would be}} to ignore the specificities of women's oppression, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that feminist theories were in danger of losing contact with the united interests of men and women workers.|$|R
5|$|One of Yaponchik's victims is {{identified}} as a restorer of Russian icons. Her home is searched, and {{it is found that}} she had uncovered Yaponchik's identity and attempted to appease him by sending him several icons. Black feels Yaponchik is killing in order to perpetuate the legends surrounding him by instilling fear in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> them. Watts and Black visit the Russian Embassy to find the man the icons were being mailed to—Sergei Stepanovich, identifiable as Yaponchik. Stepanovich is protected by diplomatic immunity; however, it becomes clear that Surova, Medikov and an Orthodox priest who aided the investigation have all been stalking Stepanovich, who they believe to be the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Midway through season three, Kate persuades Rousseau to {{help some}} of the {{survivors}} find the Others' home, by informing her that Alex helped her escape from the Others. When they arrive, Rousseau abandons the group and watches from the bushes as Alex walks past. A few days later, Rousseau leads the survivors to the radio tower {{in order for them}} to contact a nearby freighter. En route, they encounter Ben and Alex; Ben explains to Alex who Rousseau is and the mother and daughter are reunited. Season four begins with the survivors dividing into two groups, with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> the people from the freighter to be dangerous, including Rousseau and Alex, joining Locke (Terry O'Quinn). After learning of the freighter crew's intentions to kill everyone on the island, Ben directs Rousseau, along with Alex and her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff), to head to the Temple where the rest of the Others are located. On their way, Rousseau and Karl are shot by unseen attackers, and both are killed. The buried bodies of both are discovered by Miles (Ken Leung), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Claire after they leave Locke and travel back to the beach.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some way}} God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believe</b> in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The {{struggle}} between Hutchinson and the magistrates was {{an echo of}} a larger struggle at work throughout the Christian world between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> in direct, personal, and continuing revelation from God (Anabaptists) and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>believed</b> that the Bible represented the final authority on revelation from God (Calvinism, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism).

50|$|Pessimism and {{optimism}} {{also appear to}} be important psychological factors in determining whether a voter chooses an open or a closed candidate.
