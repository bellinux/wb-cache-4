For example, treatment with the insecticide <b>triazophos</b> causes {{an increase in the}} content of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)) male accessory gland proteins (Acps) that can be transferred to females via mating, causing an increase in fecundity (i.e. birth rate) of females. [...] To identify changes in the types of accessory gland proteins (Acps) and reproductive proteins that mated female planthoppers received from male planthoppers, researchers conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of mated N. lugens females. The results indicated that these proteins participate in the reproductive process of N. lugens adult females and males.|$|E
50|$|Adelphocoris lineolatus are {{commonly}} known as the alfalfa plant bug, due to the excessive amount of damage they cause to alfalfa crops around the world. In order to decrease and prevent the rapid dispersal of A. lineolatus certain control methods need to be implemented, to decrease the amount of ecological and economic damage these pests cause. Insecticides are not commonly used to decrease or stop Adelphocoris lineolatus from infesting crops because these insects have become resistant to certain chemicals present in insecticides. A. lineolatus nymphs have become resistant to the following chemical ingredients commonly used in insecticides, mono-methanimidamide, fufenozide, buprofezin, azad irachtin, and <b>triazophos.</b> An alternative from these chemicals would be to use insecticides made of pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, carbamate, avermectin, or organophosphate since alfalfa plant bugs are not resistant to these chemicals. Insecticides can be an effective and efficient method of controlling pests, but they do cause a great deal of damage to our environment and we should refrain from using them if possible.|$|E
5000|$|Rice plants {{infected}} with RRSV are stunted with whitish spindle-shaped outgrowths. Later the infected leaves become twisted with ragged edges, and may eventually turn brown. Rice plants may survive the infection, but yields are greatly reduced due to delayed flowering, incomplete panicle emergence, and unfilled grains. [...] Symptoms of RRSV infection {{vary with the}} variety of rice and stage of growth. Most rice varieties of Oryza sativa japonica and Oryza sativa indica are susceptible to RRSV though several resistant varieties are available. Attempts to prevent RRSV infections by controlling BPH with insecticides often have the opposite effect of facilitating RRSV outbreaks; this can {{be due to a}} disproportionate effect of insecticides on the natural enemies of BPH. Certain types of insecticides (e.g., <b>triazophos)</b> increase the birthrates of BPH through their effects on the reproductive systems of male and female planthoppers. [...] The increase in BPH populations not only increases the incidence of RRSV within a field, but as the BPH become crowded they transform into long-winged migratory forms (known as macropterous forms) and spread RRSV to fields up to hundreds of kilometers away.|$|E

Subsequently, the recombinant anti-triazophos scFv- 8 C 10 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli strain HB 2151 in soluble form, purified through immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, and verified via Western blot and peptide mass fingerprinting analyses. Afterward, an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was established based on the purified anti-triazophos scFv- 8 C 10 antibody. The assay exhibited properties similar to those based on the parent mAb, with a high sensitivity (IC 50 of 1. 73 ng/mL) to <b>triazophos</b> and no cross reaction for other organophosphorus pesticides; it was reliable in detecting <b>triazophos</b> residues in spiked water samples. Moreover, kinetic measurement using a surface plasmon resonance biosensor indicated that the purified scFv- 8 C 10 antibody had a high affinity of 1. 8 × 10 − 10 M and exhibited good binding stability.

40|$|M. Sc. The {{possible}} {{resistance of}} the red spider mite, Tetranychus cinnabarinus, on cotton to the acaricides <b>triazophos</b> and profenofos was studied in the Groblersdal/Marble Hall area. During the 1980 and 1981 seasons T. cinnabarinus was collected from cotton in four districts where mite infestations had been controlled the preceeding two seasons with up to three <b>triazophos</b> sprays per year. A laboratory culture of T. cinnabarinus served as the control and the response of these mites to different concentrations of acaricides were {{compared with those of}} the four field cultures. The toxicity of <b>triazophos</b> and profenofos was evaluated by using the slide-dip technique and mortality readings were taken 24 hours after exposure to the acaricide solutions. The data were subjected to a pro bit analysis. Where pro bit lines could not be fitted second degree polinomial regressions were fitted through the log dose and empirical probits. During 1980 there was little difference between the susceptibility of the four field cultures to <b>triazophos.</b> However, the regression lines of all four cultures when compared with those of the control culture indicated resistance to <b>triazophos.</b> After these field cultures had been reared under controlled conditions and not exposed to pesticides for a year all signs of <b>triazophos</b> resistance disappeared. The four field cultures collected in 1981 showed great variability in their response to <b>triazophos</b> but no indication of resistance was observed. This may be because the recommended cotton pest control programme was more closely followed by the cotton producers in 1981 and fewer acaricide sprays were applied. The accuracy of the mortality readings made 24 hours after exposure to <b>triazophos</b> was investigated by taking readings at intervals of 8 hours. An analysis of the results indicated that the mortality curves calculated from all readings were not significantly different and consequently mortality readings were made every 24 hours after exposure to the acaricide solution. A second laboratory strain of T. cinnabarinus, obtained from the Fruit and Fruit Technology Research Institute in Stellenbosch, and regarded as susceptible to organo phosphates was also tested for resistance to <b>triazophos.</b> The regression lines obtained for this culture was similar to that obtained from the 1980 field cultures. This was taken as an indication of possible resistance and this culture was therefore not used as a con trol in this study. The control culture and the Groblersdal/Marble Hall field cultures did not differ significantly in their susceptibility to profenofos. However, profenofos is not widely used for the control of T. cinnabarinus on cotton and these results indicate that it can still be used effectively for the control of T. cinnabarinus. A third acaricide, amitraz, was also examined to determine its effect on T. cinnabarinus. The slide-dip technique was found to be unsuitable for the determination of mite resistance to amitraz. This acaricide is slow acting and an observation interval longer than 24 hours is required to obtain the necessary mortality data. It is difficult to exclude the effects of starvation when the slide-dip technique is used for prolonged periods and consequently amitraz was not tested further. An alternative method for the effective evaluation of this acaricide must be developed. From this study no definite evidence of resistance of T. cinnabarinus in the Grtoblersdal/Marble Hall cotton growing area to <b>triazophos</b> or profenofos was found.

Both the probability of occurrence and {{the severity of the}} hazard were assessed for 36 chemical compounds and classified into low, medium, high, and severe. Probability of occurrence was evaluated based on available monitoring data and RASFF notifications as well as possibilities for economic adulteration. Severity was assessed based on available toxicological reference values and classification of carcinogenicity. The results demonstrated that the mycotoxins aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, the pesticides chlorpyrifos and <b>triazophos,</b> and the dye Sudan I posed the highest human health risk for spices and herbs.

40|$|Ceara, Brazil is {{considered}} important region of agribusiness {{of the country}} due to the installation of various fruit exporting companies. The present work has as main objective investigate twelve types of pesticides (molinate, atrazine, methyl parathion, malathion, chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion, pendimenthalin, <b>triazophos,</b> bentazone, azoxystrobin, propiconazole, difenoconazole) used {{in the region to}} assess the level of contamination of waters used for potable and irrigation. Analysis of pesticides were performed using chromatographic techniques (SPME-GC/MS and SPE-HPLC/DAD) through methodologies validated according to parameters recommended by ABNT. Among the 60 water samples, 48 were positive for {{at least one of the}} twelve active ingredients studied. Fungicides propiconazole and difenoconazole were detected more frequently. The total pesticide levels ranging from 0. 11 - 17. 30 µg/L were detected in the samples. The levels detected in surface and groundwater were lower than the limits established in Brazil, but 80 % of the samples analyzed were above total pesticide levels established by the European Community (> 0. 5 µg/L).

40|$|Analysis using {{polyacrylamide}} gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of four strains of the tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, collected from cotton in Turkey showed all insects to be assignable to the geographically widespread B biotype of this species. Bioassays with appropriate life-stages were used to investigate the status of resistance to two pyrethroid insecticides (bifenthrin and fenpropathrin), two organophosphates (OPs) (formothion and <b>triazophos)</b> and an insect growth regulator (buprofezin). All four strains showed significant resistance to pyrethroids (57 - to 360 -fold) and OPs (20 - to 310 -fold). Resistance to buprofezin was found only in a strain from Izmir. Total non-specific esterase activities were 7. 4 - 11 -fold greater than in an in secticide-susceptible strain, and were likely to account, in part at least, for resistance to pyrethroids. Inhibition assays with acetylcholinesterase also implicated target-site modification as a mechanism of resistance to OPs. The data update previous results on the resistance status of B. tabaci in Turkey and the implications for managing resistance on cotton and other whitefly hosts are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A bacterial strain being capable of degrading O,O-dialkyl phosphorothioate and O,O-dialkyl phosphate insecticides, designated as G 1, was isolated from sludge collected at the drain outlet of a chlorpyrifos manufacture plant. Physiological and biochemical characteristics and 16 S rDNA gene sequence analysis suggested that strain G 1 belongs to the genus Stenotrophomonas. At an initial concentration of 50 mg/L, strain G 1 degraded 100 % of methyl parathion, methyl paraoxon, diazinon, and phoxim, 95 % of parathion, 63 % of chlorpyrifos, 38 % of profenofos, and 34 % of <b>triazophos</b> in 24 h. Orthogonal experiments showed that the optimum conditions were an inoculum volume of 20 % (v/v), a substrate concentration of 50 mg/L, and an incubation temperature in 40 °C. p-Nitrophenol was detected as the metabolite of methyl parathion, for which intracellular methyl parathion hydrolase was responsible. Strain G 1 can efficiently degrade eight organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and is a very excellent candidate for applications in OP pollution remediation...|$|E

40|$|O conhecimento das interações entre Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), outros ácaros fitófagos ou predadores e as plantas de cafeeiro ainda são insuficientes para se poder elaborar um programa adequado de manejo da cultura, para tentar solucionar os problemas causados pela mancha anular. Apesar da importância do problema, pouco se sabe sobre a diversidade de ácaros, assim como a dinâmica populacional do ácaro B. phoenicis e seus inimigos naturais na cultura cafeeira, bem como nas diversas cultivares comercialmente exploradas. As informações sobre o impacto de agroquímicos nas populações de ácaros em cafeeiro são praticamente inexistentes. Contudo, sabe-se que alguns inseticidas ou fungicidas podem afetar a população de ácaros predadores podendo favorecer o aumento populacional de ácaros pragas. Ao caracterizar a diversidade de ácaros em duas importantes regiões produtoras (Jeriquara e Garça), constatou-se que em Jeriquara a diversidade foi {{superior}} ao encontrado em Garça. Foram coletados no total 13. 052 ácaros nos dois locais estudados, sendo 7. 155 em Jeriquara e 5. 897 em Garça. De um total de 108 espécies encontradas, 45 espécies foram observadas em ambos os locais avaliados, que apresentaram similaridade de 56 %. Os predadores mais freqüentes nas folhas foram Euseius citrifolius Denmark & Muma, E. concordis (Chant) e Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira. Foram observadas correlações significativas a 0, 05 % (Pearson) entre as populações E. concordis e B. phoenicis; Zetzellia malvinae Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira e B. phoenicis; E. concordis e A. brasiliensis; entre outras. Em relação à diversidade em diferentes cultivares de cafeeiro (Coffea canephora cv Apoatã e de C. arabica cultivares Mundo Novo, Icatu Vermelho, Icatu Amarelo e Catuaí Amarelo) realizado em Garça, verificou-se que a maior riqueza de espécies e o maior número de indivíduos na superfície das folhas foram observados para Apoatã. A cultivar Icatu Vermelho foi a que apresentou maior uniformidade na distribuição das espécies de ácaros e Apoatã a que apresentou menor uniformidade. Em relação à preferência hospedeira, B. phoenicis foi encontrado em maior abundância na cultivar Apoatã, representando 61 % de todos os indivíduos. E. citrifolius ocorreu em maior número na cultivar Mundo Novo e E. concordis na Apoatã. A. brasiliensis ocorreu em maior quantidade na cultivar Icatu Vermelho e Z. malvinae ocorreu sem diferença estatística em todas as cultivares. Em relação aos efeitos de pesticidas sobre a diversidade de ácaros, constatou-se que no tratamento com triadimenol + disulfoton apresentou a menor, enquanto que no deltametrina + <b>triazophos</b> a maior. B. phoenicis apresentou redução no número de indivíduos no tratamento com aldicarb e um aumento de cerca de duas vezes nos tratamentos com triadimenol + disulfoton e no thiamethoxam. Os tratamentos que apresentaram as maiores semelhanças na composição das espécies foram: testemunha e cartap, e thiamethoxam e ethion; e os tratamentos de menor similiaridade foram: testemunha e aldicarb, aldicarb e cartap, e aldicarb e deltametrina + <b>triazophos.</b> Reduções significativas na população de A. brasiliensis nos tratamentos com aldicarb e thiamethoxam e de E. citrifolius no tratamento com cartap foram detectadas. The {{knowledge on}} the interactions among Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), other phytophagous or predaceous mites and coffee plants is still insufficient {{to establish an}} adequate management program for this crop, {{in order to minimize}} the problems caused by coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV), transmitted by B. phoenicis. In spite of the problem, little is known on the diversity of mites, {{as well as on the}} population dynamics of B. phoenicis and its natural enemies on coffee plants of several important commercial cultivars. Information on the impact of agrochemicals on the population of mites on coffee plantations are practically inexistent. However, it is known that some insecticides and fungicides can affect the population of predaceous mites inducing pest mite population increases. Characterizing the diversity of mites on two important coffee-producing areas of the state of São Paulo (Jeriquara and Garça), it was observed that the diversity of mites was higher in Jeriquara county than in Garça. A total of 13, 052 mites was collected in both studied areas, of which 7, 155 in Jeriquara and 5, 897 in Garça. Of the total of 108 species identified in this study, 45 species were observed in both localities (Garça an Jeriquara), which presented 56 % of similarity. The most frequent predaceous mites on leaves were Euseius concordis (Chant), E. citrifolius Denmark & Muma and Agistemus brasiliensis Matioli, Ueckermann & Oliveira, among others. The study on the diversity of mites in different coffee cultivars (Coffea canephora cv. Apoatã and C. arabica cv. Mundo Novo, Icatu Vermelho, Icatu Amarelo and Catuai Amarelo), carried out in Garça, showed the highest species richness and the highest number of specimens for the leaf surface of Apoatã. Icatu Vermelho was the cultivar which presented the highest uniformity of distribution of mite species and Apoatã was the cultivar with the lowest uniformity. The species B. phoenicis was found in higher abundance in Apoatã, representing 61 % of all specimens collected. E. citrifolius occurred in higher number on the cultivar Mundo Novo and E. concordis in Apoatã. The stigmaeid mite A. brasiliensis occurred in higher number on the cultivar Icatu Vermelho and Z. malvinae was present in similar populations on all coffee cultivars. The study on the effect of pesticides on the mite diversity, showed the lowest diversity for the treatment with triadimenol + dissulfoton, and the highest diversity was observed for treatment with deltamethrin + <b>triazophos.</b> B. phoenicis presented population reduction for the treatments aldicarb, but an increase of around two times for treatments with triadimenol + disulfoton and with thiamethoxam.
