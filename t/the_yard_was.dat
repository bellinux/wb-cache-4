5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{part of the}} most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.|$|E
5|$|Most trains {{that serve}} the Bloor–Danforth line are stored at the Greenwood Subway Yard, which opened {{with the first}} segment of the line. Before <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> built, the land was {{occupied}} by a quarry and a garbage dump. Due to its location next to the Canadian National Railway tracks, {{it was possible for}} trains to be delivered directly to the subway. The CN rail tracks were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T-1 series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. In addition to providing storage for subway trains, the Greenwood yard is also used to maintain vehicles, which operate on Line 3 Scarborough as the McCowan RT Yard is only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} ships were {{built at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino yard, Trieste. As a {{condition}} of agreeing to the construction and financing of the new fleet, the Hungarian parliament insisted {{that one of the}} battleships be built at the Hungarian facility, the Danubius yard at Fiume. However, the Danibius shipyard had until then never built anything larger than a destroyer. So construction was delayed as <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> extended in preparation for the dreadnought. For this reason the final ship, delivered seventeen months late, was given a Hungarian name: Szent István ("Saint Stephen", after Stephen I, the first king and patron saint of Hungary.|$|E
50|$|Linwood <b>Yard</b> <b>is</b> one of <b>the</b> largest {{classification}} railroad {{yards in}} North Carolina. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> operated by Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> located 3 mi north of Salisbury off Interstate 85 in Davidson County, west of Linwood. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} NS Charlotte District and Danville District, and the Asheville District is nearby in Salisbury.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> located {{adjoining}} <b>the</b> Davisville Station, between Eglinton and St. Clair Stations. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> next to <b>the</b> TTC {{headquarters at}} 1900 Yonge Street.|$|R

5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market, in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by General Dynamics Corporation. J. William Jones, President of the company, stated that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> purchased {{in order to}} provide its Electric Boat division with increased flexibility. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> purchased for $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), and Electric Boat managed the yard until its reorganization. Immediately, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> closed by Bethlehem Steel on 1 January 1964, and it was announced that thirteen hundred of the yard's employees would be retired or pensioned off immediately or within the next two years, leaving five hundred workers left. General Dynamics immediately invested $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) into various facilities in the yard, improving it in many ways.|$|E
25|$|After Roberts died <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> used {{by other}} companies.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> {{surrounded}} by old residential neighborhoods and some abandoned industrial facilities. To {{the north of}} <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> beneath <b>the</b> tracks, runs Hertel Avenue. An abandoned portion of <b>the</b> north <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> now an automobile junk yard; Austin Street runs under the center of <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Most of <b>the</b> trackbed in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> has <b>been</b> ripped up.|$|R

50|$|Güvercinlik Yard (Ankara Demiryol Fabrikası, meaning Ankara Railway Factory) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest <b>yard</b> in Turkey. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Etimesgut {{district}} of Ankara and {{is owned by}} the Turkish State Railways. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> consists of a freight yard, passenger yard, a large maintenance facility and a logistics center. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> next to <b>the</b> İstanbul-Ankara Main Line near Marşandiz railway station.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{bought by}} John Roberts. Francis' son, Michael Morgan-Giles, {{directed}} the yard {{for a few}} more years under the Morgan Giles name.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{connected}} to the North British Railway by an extensive internal rail network that carried steel to {{various parts of the}} yard.|$|E
25|$|The Churchyard {{dates to}} the fourteenth century but has been {{extended}} many times, including 1827 (when <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> enclosed), 1864, 1886, 1924 and 1950.|$|E
50|$|Stomp <b>the</b> <b>Yard</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack to the 2007 film, Stomp <b>the</b> <b>Yard.</b> It <b>was</b> {{released}} on April 24, 2007 through Artists' Addiction Records and peaked at 20 on the Billboard charts' Top Soundtracks.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Lower 63rd <b>Yard</b> <b>is</b> {{located at}} 63rd and Calumet in Chicago, Illinois, <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> used for storing CTA {{equipment}} and 2400-series work train railcars are stored here.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> can rotate {{around the}} mast {{to allow the}} {{direction}} of the vessel to be changed relative to the wind. When running directly downwind <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> <b>are</b> 'squared', pointing perpendicular to the ship's centre line. As the ship is steered closer to <b>the</b> wind <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> <b>are</b> braced round using the braces. When further rotation is obstructed by other bits of rigging (typically <b>the</b> shrouds), <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> said to be braced [...] "hard round" [...] or [...] "sharp up", as in [...] "sharp up to port". This angle (normally about 60 degrees) limits how close to the wind a square rigged ship can sail.|$|R
25|$|However, by 1973 <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{running at}} a loss of $3.4 million, and it closed in August of that year. Its last ship was Cape York.|$|E
25|$|The first {{steamship}} {{built at}} <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> 1834 ordered Furst Menschikoff, which {{was launched in}} June 1836. The shipowner company was led by Erik Julin, who became a co-owner of the yard in 1838.|$|E
25|$|Robertson was {{a rather}} astute {{businessman}} so, as <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> booming in the early 1900s, he began buying up properties along {{the shore of the}} Holy Loch to stop other boat yards being built.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> {{listed on}} <b>the</b> New Jersey Register of Historic Places.|$|R
50|$|The site of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> now {{occupied}} by a riverside housing development.|$|R
5000|$|When a square-rigger {{is running}} downwind, and <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> <b>are</b> {{positioned}} {{perpendicular to the}} line of the keel, both sheets that control <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> (braces) <b>are</b> tied off aft (i.e., straight back), leading to the figurative phrase [...] "Both sheets aft." ...|$|R
25|$|The new YEC {{went into}} {{receivership}} in 2001 and ceased trading. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} army camp at Long Marston, which by 2007 was being used for storage of locomotives and rolling stock, both for preservation groups and commercial organisations.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> part of {{the case}} Fore River Shipbuilding Co. v. Hagg, in which a foreign citizen sued for the yard for {{reparation}} {{in the death of}} her husband, who was killed in the yard's forge shop. The case was later dismissed by the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{the company}} built 75 ships—72 cargo ships and three oil tankers—from 1916 to 1920, {{including}} 32 completed for the Emergency Fleet Corporation during the war. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1921 {{as a result}} of the severe postwar shipbuilding slump. Skinner & Eddy later became a shipping line operator, and appears to have been wound up in the early 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Since the New Globe Theatre {{opened in}} 1996, {{they have used}} <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> as an acting area or entrances. Even though the {{authenticity}} of using <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> disputable, nobody denies that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> must <b>be</b> a very effective tool for performing Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre. <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> {{an essential part of}} traditional Korean theatre, called “talchum (mask dance) ” or “talnori (mask play). ” <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> its stage as well as the auditorium. Therefore, the players are surrounded by the audience, and the players can, and often do interact with the audience, speaking to the audience, or treating them as players, or acting as if they were some of the audience. The theatrical style of using <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> has much influenced the modern theatre of Korea. And many Korean directors including Oh Tae-suk, Yang Jung-ung, Sohn Jin-chaek, Park Sung-hwan, and myself, have applied <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> techniques to their Shakespearean productions. Korean Shakespearean productions, which use <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> actively, can <b>be</b> more evidence that <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> must <b>be</b> an effective tool for Shakespeare, not only at the Globe Theatre but also at any kind of theatres of today. No one knows whether Shakespeare actually used <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> or not. But the fact that many Shakespearean productions have used <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> successfully, implies that Shakespeare's texts themselves have enough room for <b>the</b> <b>yard...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> also {{building}} a 23.9m compact tug from the Port of Napier in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>yards</b> <b>were</b> one {{of several}} {{contractors}} to the Royal Canadian Navy for ship repair and maintenance.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} contract {{called for}} Pennsylvania {{to be completed}} by December 1, 1872, but the schedule proved optimistic. A short-lived shipbuilding boom in the early 1870s made it difficult for the Cramp shipyard to obtain iron plates and other materials, and <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> also affected by shortages of skilled labor. As a consequence, the ship would not be ready for delivery until almost ten months later.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s the Burntisland yard {{switched}} from shipbuilding to prefabricating modules of superstructure for offshore oil platforms, but orders were intermittent {{and by the}} 1980s <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> largely idle. In 1990 new owners returned the yard to production as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab, resuming the manufacture of superstructure modules for oil platforms. Under a management buyout in 2001 the Burntisland yard returned to being an independent company.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{part of the}} then British Aerospace's team for the Royal Navy's Future Carrier (CVF) programme. It was envisaged that the ship would be {{assembled}} at the Harland & Wolff dry-dock in Belfast. In 1999 BAE merged with Marconi Electronic Systems. The new company, BAE Systems Marine, included the former Marconi shipyards on the Clyde and at Barrow-in-Furness thus rendering H's involvement surplus to requirements.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{remaining}} structure in <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> goods depot, which is {{visible from the}} road.|$|R
