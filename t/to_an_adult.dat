5|$|Burial 67 {{was found}} in a cist under the second of five stucco floor levels in Northeast Plaza Structure 2. The {{skeleton}} was lying on its back with the head towards the north. The remains were poorly preserved but belonged <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> Of the skull only some dental remains were found. A ceramic plate had been placed under the head of the deceased and another plate was placed upon the knees. The plate was painted with four seated anthropomorphic figures with inclined head and wearing leather gloves with jaguar claws. The facial features of the figures are unusual. The bottom of the plate bears the image of a dancer. The ceramics date the burial to the Late Classic.|$|E

Dahl's son Matt was part of the regular WCKG lineup and hosted the show immediately following his father's. However, the WCKG format change, from an FM talk station <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> contemporary station meant the end of Matt's show on WCKG.|$|E

40|$|A {{multiple}} baseline design across 3 {{children with}} autism {{was used to assess}} the effects of prompting and social reinforcement to teach participants <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult's</b> bid for joint attention and to initiate bids for joint attention. Participants were taught <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult's</b> bid for joint attention by looking in the direction of an object at which the adult pointed, by making a comment about the object, and by looking back at the adult. Additional training and reinforcement were needed to teach the participants to initiate bids for joint attention. Findings are discussed in terms of the social relevance of teaching {{children with autism}} to respond to and initiate bids for joint attention...|$|R
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1982, education in both English and French has been available in most places across Canada. Canadian provinces and territories are responsible for education provision. The mandatory school age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, contributing <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> literacy rate of 99 percent. In 2002, 43 percent of Canadians aged 25 to 64 possessed a post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34, the rate of post-secondary education reached 51 percent. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates that Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic, {{tetrapod}} vertebrates of {{the class}} Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit {{a wide variety of}} habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.|$|E

5|$|Sophie is an amnesiac girl Asbel, Hubert, Cheria, and Richard befriend. She is {{seemingly}} killed after {{protecting them}} from Lambda. She reappears {{seven years later}} when Asbel and Cheria were in danger. Sophie is revealed to be Protos Heis, a humanoid made of tiny particles acting in concert with each other. Her death seven years ago is explained as Sophie breaking up into particles residing inside Asbel, Hubert, and Cheria to heal their wounds and is the reason the three possess mystical powers. During the events of Lineage and Legacies, Sophie expresses her fears of life {{after the death of}} her friends due to her immortality. To lessen her fears, Asbel formally adopts her into the Lhant family. After fusing with a Little Queen, Sophie ages <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> and is able to express a greater variety of emotions. She is voiced by Kana Hanazawa and dubbed by Cassandra Morris. Since her debut, Sophie has ranked on the Tales character popularity polls. Sophie is a playable character in Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 3.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{show that}} nuptial flight {{does not occur}} before February. This is based on larvae {{spinning}} into cocoons by November, and by January, these cocoons could not produce adult workers or reproductive males and females. Queens are most likely fertilised by males sometime between February and April; however, scientists have seen alates engage in nuptial flight during March. Before emerging from their parent nest, queens will shed their wings inside the nest and mate with low-flying males nearby. After nuptial flight, a queen will isolate herself and form a small chamber underground, where she remains for seven to eight months. However, it is improbable that a queen can survive on her own storage of fat and wing-musculature for that long. During this time, the queen may emerge from her nest occasionally, but she will only lay eggs from October to November {{when there is a}} rich supply of food. While this may be the case, some queens will lay eggs after a month of isolation during winter. M.regularis is a semi-clasutral ant, meaning that a queen will go out and forage in order to feed her young. Queens will emerge from their nests from time to time, during which they will capture insects for their young or feed on sweet substances. If food sources are deprived, a queen will only rely on her fat to feed the larvae until she perishes or finds food, but the larvae will not be cannibalised, and remain alive until a week after the queen's death. An individual ant may take eight months to develop from an egg <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designer for}} nearly all entries in the series is Kimihiko Fujisaka. Initially a minor staff member at Cavia, the team were impressed by his skill as an amateur artist and he was recommended for the post of character designer for the game. The designs for both the characters and the world were influenced by armor and clothing of Medieval Europe. He returned in the same capacity for Drakengard 2, and later for Nier. Disliking some of his initial designs for Drakengard, he {{took the opportunity to}} remodel them more to his liking for the arcade game Lord of Vermilion. For Niers international release, the protagonist was redesigned from a teenager <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> character. This was because the publishers felt an older character would appeal more to western players. In Drakengard 3, Fujisaka designed the protagonist Zero around the dark themes of the game, although some unusual elements were nearly cut. The other female characters were inspired by Puella Magi Madoka Magica, while the male characters, considered a low priority, were designed around male archetypes and approved quickly. For Nier: Automata, the designs were handled by Akihiko Yoshida, an artist noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series. While he was initially expected to refuse, he agreed as several staff at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. For his designs, Yoko requested he focus on smooth outlines and black coloring.|$|E
