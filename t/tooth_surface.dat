5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the buccal (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Digitized hypoid gear’s surface model, {{which is}} {{constructed}} by NURBS method, can set free {{the constraints of}} conventional processing technique {{in the process of}} designing and manufacturing hypoid gear. The digitalization of <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> of hypoid gears consists of three parts: building large gear’s NURBS model, calculating small <b>tooth</b> <b>surface’s</b> character parameters based on actual requirements and small <b>tooth</b> <b>surface’s</b> digitalization. The digitalization of <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be realized by machining simulation, and the key points are how to establish equations of cutter head and grids of gear solid, and how to judge correct trace points in the process of machining simulation. With the aid of digitized model of hypoid gear, tooth contact analysis can be accomplished by regular motion of two NURBS <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to link the wear on Elasmotherium teeth to grazing. In 1938, H.E. Wood, a Rhinocerotid tooth specialist, pointed out that {{interproximal}} wear, or loss of <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> between teeth, due to abrasion during mastication, of Elasmotherium {{is similar to that of}} the white rhinoceros, the only remaining Rhinocerotid grazer, which has hypsodont teeth. Data such as this led to an intuitive concept of some sort of correlation between grass-eating and hypsodonty, but it has been difficult to isolate mathematically.|$|E
25|$|Dental care – Carbohydrates and sugars usually {{adhere to}} the tooth enamel, where {{bacteria}} feed upon them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert the sugar to acids that decay the teeth. Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth as they are not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. A sweetener that can actually benefit dental health is xylitol, which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering to the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface,</b> thus preventing plaque formation and eventually decay. Xylitol cannot be fermented by bacteria that feed on sugar, so they have difficulty thriving, thus helping to prevent plaque formation.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} caries is acid from {{bacteria}} dissolving the hard tissues of the teeth (enamel, dentin and cementum). The acid is produced from food debris or sugar on the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Simple sugars in food are these bacteria's {{primary energy source}} and thus a diet high in simple sugar is a risk factor. If mineral breakdown is greater than build up from sources such as saliva, caries results. Risk factors include conditions that result in less saliva such as: diabetes mellitus, Sjogren's syndrome and some medications. Medications that decrease saliva production include antihistamines and antidepressants. Caries is also associated with poverty, poor cleaning of the mouth, and receding gums resulting in exposure of {{the roots of the}} teeth.|$|E
40|$|The Euler-Savary {{equation}} {{is the most}} fundamental relationship {{used to determine the}} relative curvature of a two-dimensional tooth profile which corresponds to relative motion. In this paper, the necessary conditions for gearing were analyzed, when a pair of <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> mesh continuously with a contact line and the basic relationships between <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> and their relative motion were derived mathematically. In addition, the relative normal curvature and the geodesic torsion of the <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> and relative motion were shown to be related to hypoid gears, and the Euler-Savary law was extended to the equation of three-dimensional <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> for the most general form of gearign...|$|R
40|$|Gears {{are perhaps}} one of the {{important}} components used in machinery to transmit motion and power. Transmission of force and motion occur at the same moment for mutual working gears. Transmission of the force and motion from a gear to another is a result of rolling-sliding contact of <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> each other. This rolling-sliding contact causes some stresses on surface and subsurface. In this study, analysis of stresses on surface and subsurface due to rolling-sliding contact on <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> are carried out. In the solution of the problem, different friction coefficients between <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> and are taken as the variables. The contact analysis between <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> is based upon Hertz elastic contact theory and for the numerical solution ANSYS 54 finite element program code is used...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine whether immunization of mice with fimbrial adhesins isolated from Actinomyces viscosus T 14 V could modulate infection of <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> in animals challenged with the homologous strain. Saliva and sera from animals immunized in the submandibular gland region contained elevated levels of fimbria-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG, whereas saliva and sera from sham-immunized animals did not. There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between the presence of fimbria-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and the levels of bacterial colonization on molar <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These results suggest that fimbrial adhesins may effectively modulate infection of <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> by periodontopathic bacteria...|$|R
25|$|All 6-carbon sugars and disaccharides {{based on}} 6-carbon sugars can be {{converted}} by dental plaque bacteria into acid that demineralizes teeth, but sucrose may be uniquely useful to Streptococcus sanguinis (formerly Streptococcus sanguis) and Streptococcus mutans. Sucrose is the only dietary sugar that {{can be converted}} to sticky glucans (dextran-like polysaccharides) by extracellular enzymes. These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable S. mutans, S. sanguinis and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist removal, e.g. by flow of saliva (although they are easily removed by brushing). The glucans and levans (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{dental plaque}} biofilm {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface)</b> is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E
500|$|Certain {{bacteria}} in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars and starches. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel. This process, known as [...] "demineralisation", leads to tooth destruction. Saliva gradually neutralises the acids which cause the pH of the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> {{to rise above the}} critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes 'remineralisation', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.|$|E
40|$|The {{geometry}} of {{spiral bevel gears}} and to their rational design are studied. The nonconjugate <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> of spiral bevel gears are, in theory, replaced (or approximated) by conjugated <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These surfaces can be generated by two conical surfaces, and by a conical surface and a revolution. Although these conjugated <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> are simpler than the actual ones, the determination of their principal curvatures and directions is still a complicated problem. Therefore, a new approach, to the solution of these is proposed. Direct relationships between the principal curvatures and directions of the tool surface {{and those of the}} generated gear surface are obtained. With the aid of these analytical tools, the Hertzian contact problem for conjugate <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be solved. These results are useful in determining compressive load capacity and surface fatigue life of spiral bevel gears. A general theory of kinematical errors exerted by manufacturing and assembly errors is developed. This theory is used to determine the analytical relationship between gear misalignments and kinematical errors. This is important to the study of noise and vibration in geared systems...|$|R

2500|$|Some dental {{researchers}} have cautioned {{against the use}} of dental explorers to find caries, in particular sharp ended explorers. In cases where a small area of tooth has begun demineralizing but has not yet cavitated, the pressure from the dental explorer could cause a cavity. [...] Since the carious process is reversible before a cavity is present, {{it may be possible to}} arrest caries with fluoride and remineralize the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface.</b> When a cavity is present, a restoration will be needed to replace the lost tooth structure.|$|E
2500|$|Despite fluoridation's detractors, most dental {{professionals}} and organizations {{agree that the}} inclusion of fluoride in public water {{has been one of}} the most effective methods of decreasing the prevalence of tooth decay. Fluoride can be found in many locations naturally, such as the ocean and other water sources. The recommended dosage of fluoride in drinking water depends on air temperature. Fluoride catalyzes the diffusion of calcium and phosphate into the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface,</b> which in turn remineralizes the crystalline structures in a dental cavity. The remineralized tooth surfaces contain fluoridated hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite, which resist acid attack much better than the original tooth did [...] Fluoride therapy is used to help prevent dental decay.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{things are}} {{required}} for caries formation: a <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> (enamel or dentin), caries-causing bacteria, fermentable carbohydrates (such as sucrose), and time. This involves adherence of food to the teeth and acid creation by the bacteria that makes up the dental plaque. [...] However, these four criteria are not always enough to cause the disease and a sheltered environment promoting development of a cariogenic biofilm is required. [...] The caries disease process {{does not have an}} inevitable outcome, and different individuals will be susceptible to different degrees depending on the shape of their teeth, oral hygiene habits, and the buffering capacity of their saliva. [...] Dental caries can occur on any surface of a tooth that is exposed to the oral cavity, but not the structures that are retained within the bone.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Caries risk {{assessment}} tools {{operate on the}} subject level. The aim {{of the study is}} to create new caries {{risk assessment}} models that functions on the <b>tooth</b> and <b>surface</b> level to assess the risk of caries of single <b>teeth</b> and <b>surfaces.</b> METHODS: Secondary data from the Dental Longitudinal Study was used to evaluate caries symmetry. Teeth were grouped into posterior and anterior <b>teeth.</b> <b>Surfaces</b> were grouped into fissured, proximal, and facial and lingual surfaces. The prediction of future caries on a <b>tooth</b> or a <b>surface</b> by the current caries on a bilateral or adjacent <b>tooth</b> or <b>surface</b> was evaluated. Additional general and oral caries risk factors on <b>teeth</b> and <b>surfaces</b> were adopted from the American Dental Association caries risk assessment tool. Caries on bilateral and/or adjacent <b>teeth</b> or <b>surfaces</b> were augmented with significant oral clinical caries predictor to build the caries risk assessment tools for <b>teeth</b> and <b>surfaces.</b> The models were validated by calculating sensitivities and specificities. RESULTS: 495 subjects with baseline and three year follow up data were included in the study. Caries prevalence and incidence was symmetrical (right and left) on the population level. On the individual level, caries incidence was symmetrical (right and left) and also tends to affect adjacent <b>teeth</b> or <b>surfaces.</b> Baseline caries on bilateral and adjacent <b>teeth</b> and <b>surfaces</b> was predictive of caries at follow up in all groups of <b>teeth</b> and <b>surfaces</b> except posterior <b>teeth.</b> Local oral caries risk factors like visible plaque, interproximal restorations, and xerostomia significantly predicted caries on single <b>teeth</b> and <b>surfaces.</b> Tools of caries risk assessment for anterior teeth and the three groups of surfaces were built. The sensitivities of these tools ranged between 67. 33 % to 85. 51 %, specificities ranged between 38. 40 % to 66. 11 %, and the overall accuracies ranged between 41. 95 % to 66. 27 %. CONCLUSION: Dental caries is a symmetrical disease affecting the right and left sides of the mouth equally. Past caries experience is significant in predicting future caries. New models were built to assess caries risk for anterior <b>teeth,</b> fissured <b>surfaces,</b> proximal surfaces, and facial and lingual surfaces with acceptable accuracy. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

2500|$|Early colonizers of the <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> {{are mainly}} Neisseria spp. and streptococci, {{including}} S. mutans.
