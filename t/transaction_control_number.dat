40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} a rapid growth of {{services}} based on session control. Session-based services comprise multimedia conferences, Internet telephone calls, instant messaging, and similar applications consisting {{of one or more}} media types such as audio and video. Deployment examples include session control services as part of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), in the third-generation mobile networks. High service dependability in session control systems is achieved by introducing redundancy, e. g., through reliable server pooling (RSerPool) or clustering. Namely, session control servers are multiplied in server sets. Performance of such replicated session control servers is quantified by <b>transaction</b> <b>control</b> time. Thus, reducing <b>transaction</b> <b>control</b> time enhances performance. Server selection policies (SSP) are crucial in achieving this goal. The maximum availability (MA) SSP is proposed to improve session control performance in scenarios with server and communication failures. Based on a status vector, MA aims at maximizing the probability of successful transaction with the current transmission, thereby minimizing the average number of attempted servers until success. MA is applicable in a broad range of IP-based systems and services, and it is independent of the fault-tolerant platform. A simple protocol extension is proposed in order to integrate MA into the RSerPool fault-tolerant architecture. In addition, an analytic model is derived based on certain system model assumptions. Analytic and simulation results show that <b>transaction</b> <b>control</b> time is considerably reduced with MA as opposed to when using traditional round robin. Index Terms—Fault-tolerance, performance, server selection policies (SSP), session control. I...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a model and}} notation for specifying and enforcing aspects of integrity policies, particularly separation of duties. The key idea is to associate a <b>transaction</b> <b>control</b> expression with each information object. This expression constrains the transactions which {{can be applied to}} that object to occur in the specified pattern. As operations are actually executed the <b>transaction</b> <b>control</b> expression gets converted to a history. This history serves to enforce separation of duties. We distinguish transient objects with a short lifetime from persistent objects which are long lived. Separation of duties is achieved by maintaining a complete history for transient objects but only a partial history for persistent objects. This is possible because of the system enforced rule that transactions are executed on persistent objects only as a side effect of execution on transient objects. 1 INTRODUCTION The issues raised by Clark and Wilson [2] have stimulated recent interest in integrity pol [...] ...|$|R
