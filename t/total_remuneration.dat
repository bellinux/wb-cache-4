40|$|The {{issue of}} {{executive}} pay levels in Australia {{has moved to}} the top of the agenda of concerns raised by fund managers and shareholders. Australian Government ministers and the general public have entered the debates regarding executive payment and the actual performance of executives and the organisations, which they head in light of their salary and non-salary packages. Recent trends have been an exponential growth in the absolute level of executive <b>total</b> cash <b>remuneration,</b> and a shift in the composition of <b>total</b> executive <b>remuneration</b> away from base salary and benefits to incentive pay, in particular long-term incentives such as share options, share purchase plans and share option entitlements (Shields, O’Donnell & O’Brien 2002). This research seeks to determine the relationship between high executive pay and company performance in Australia, the level of value that executives deliver to shareholders for their increasing investment, and the improvements that can be instituted to ensure fairness and procedural justice. Since 1998, the Australian Financial Review has published an annual review of executive remuneration for Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and equivalent positions in Australia’s largest publicly listed companies, based mainly on information provided in company annual reports for the previous financial year. These annual reviews have been applied to other publicly available information on corporate performance to gauge the impact of executive salaries and options packages for 20 of Australia’s largest companies. Analysis of the data revealed significant growth in executive remuneration levels in Australia coupled with similar growth in options packages with “long-term incentives”. The link between executive pay and company performance is not evident in Australia. In fact, the counter may be said to be true with executives receiving remuneration beyond certain levels coinciding with a lack of company performance and a lower bottom line. A range of strategies are recommended to increase the transparency of executive packages to shareholders and funds managers and increase corporate governance requirements through the Corporations Act, and empower the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) through introducing more stringent disclosure requirements...|$|R

These findings are challenged by more recent studies. Using the 2002 China Household Income Project data, both Démurger et al.

This paper aims to provide an insightful and up-to-date complement to existing literature {{particularly with respect to}} short-term executive remuneration and corporate governance practices specifically in the UK. This study initially provides an overview of the main theoretical concepts related to executive remuneration and then examines the pay-performance link. It also attempts to observe the effect of various other determinants of <b>total</b> executive <b>remuneration</b> on a sample of fifty companies from the FTSE 100 index. The study also inspects the pay-performance relationship using various components like director base salary/fees, benefits and emoluments as well as variations of executive pay like average director remuneration and HPD remuneration. The results of this study are in line with prior research conducted in this field. The regression results indicate that firm performance has a significant impact on executive remuneration. Another significant determinant of executive pay was found to be the firm size variable which indicated that the level of executive pay increases with firm size. The findings of the study also suggest that corporate governance variables, measuring board characteristics like the size and proportion of non-executive directors on the board as well as the remuneration committee have an equally significant impact on the determination of executive remuneration. This study also sheds light on the corporate governance issues, mechanisms and recent reforms that have an effect on executive remuneration practices. Hence, this research focuses on executive remuneration practices prevalent in the UK and its relevance to corporate governance...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} a commentary, from a community pharmacy perspective, {{on the policy}} environment for the pharmacy sector in Australia, with a particular focus on present challenges arising from proposals to achieve substantial PBS cost savings from an anticipated surge of new generic drugs.

This growth comes from a low base where generics currently account for only 15 % of the <b>total</b> PBS budget. <b>Remuneration</b> for PBS dispensing is fixed through five year agreements with the government, so trading terms on generics are important for the cross-subsidy of other dispensing activities and professional services.

Despite these arrangements, generic substitution rates in Australia are lower than in most comparable countries, which the government views as an opportunity to promote generic use. The future of generic drug supply via the PBS is important to allow consumers access to medications at the lowest possible price and to provide space for PBS listing of new and expensive drugs. But considerations of PBS reform need to take account of the role and viability of community pharmacy sector as provider of pharmaceuticals in a timely and efficient manner to Australian residents...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{inequality}} and stagnating wages {{at the bottom}} of the earning distribution are the most striking social phenomena of the last 30 years. Moreover, the 2009 Great Recession surged unemployment and created unprecedented tension between rich and poor in most developed countries. These circumstances renewed the interest of politicians, policy makers, and economists toward public policies aimed at alleviating inequality. In this thesis, I empirically assess the effectiveness of two prominent public policies in helping the poor: the minimum wage and unemployment insurance. Minimum wage is the most radical policy tool for elevating the wages of the bottom economic bracket. However, despite several decades of microeconometric evidence for increases, the minimum wage remains a highly controversial policy. The first two chapters of this dissertation are devoted to assessing the economic effects of an unusually large and persistent increase in the minimum wage instituted in Hungary in 2001. The minimum wage to the median wage increased from the current U. S. level (35 %) to the level of 55 %, which is equivalent with an (~ 60 %) increase in the minimum wage in real terms. In the first chapter, my co-author Péter Harasztosi and I study the employment effects of this unique minimum wage reform. We propose a new approach to estimating the employment effects of a minimum wage increase that exploits information on the distribution of wages before and after the policy change. We infer the number of jobs destroyed by comparing the number of pre-reform jobs below the new minimum wage to the excess number of jobs paying at (and above) the new minimum wage. The evolution of the earning distribution in Hungary shows that this ratio is close to one, suggesting that most firms responded to the reform by raising wages instead of destroying jobs. We confirm this conclusion using comparisons across subgroups of workers with larger and smaller fractions of worker affected by the minimum wage change. Our group-level estimates, again, imply that the higher minimum wage had, at most, a small negative effect on employment, and with the standard errors we can rule out larger than - 0. 3 employment elasticities with respect to wages. In the second chapter, my co-author Péter Harasztosi and I study the economic incidence of the minimum wage polices. If minimum wage increase has a small negative effect on employment and a large effect on wages, the <b>total</b> <b>remunerations</b> allocated to low-wage workers must increase. Using a large panel of firms and the Hungarian minimum wage increase, we show that this is indeed the case: firms highly exposed to the minimum wage experienced a large increase in their total labor cost. However, this raises a question: who pays for this cost increase? We show that firms' profits are not affected in response to the minimum wage, suggesting that firm-owners do not bear the incidence of the minimum wage increase. Instead, we document that total revenue of low-paying employers increased considerably, indicating that firms passed the effect of the minimum wage to consumers. Consistent with that explanation, we show that firms facing more elastic output demand, and so less ability to pass-through the effect of the minimum wage, experienced larger employment losses and lower increase in their total labor cost. In the third chapter, Stefanno DellaVigna, Balázs Reizer, Johannes Schmieder and I scrutinize the job search behavior of the unemployed. We propose a model of job search with reference-dependent preferences, where the reference point is given by recent income. Newly unemployed individuals are faced with a loss because their recent past income is higher than the unemployment benefit they receive, and so they search hard. However, over time they get used to lower income, and thus search less. They search harder, again, in anticipation of a benefit cut, only to ultimately get used to the change. The model fits the typical shape of the exit from unemployment, including the spike at the UI exhaustion point. The model also makes unique predictions for the response of benefit changes. Second, we provide evidence using a reform in the unemployment system in Hungary. Most unemployment insurance programs have constant replacement rate for a fixed period, typically followed by lower benefits under unemployment assistance. In November 2005, Hungary switched from this standard single-step UI system to a two-step system, with unchanged overall generosity. We show that the system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and especially following, benefit cuts in ways the standard model has a hard time fitting, even when allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. We structurally estimate the model and estimate a weight on gain-loss utility comparable to the weight of the standard utility term, and a speed of adjustment of the reference point of eight months. The results suggest that a revenue-neutral shift to multiple-step UI systems can speed exit from unemployment...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) can be applied to Chief Executive Officer (CEO) remuneration of companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) by defining inputs in terms of remuneration factors and outputs in terms of business factors in order to establish a benchmark for CEO remuneration. An exploratory study is conducted, using cross-sectional data from a secondary source. The sample consists of 221 companies listed on the JSE that disclosed their financial and non-financial information during 2010. The DEA was performed to estimate the relative technical efficiency of CEOs to convert their remuneration into company performance indicators. Base Pay, Perquisites and Pension, Annual Bonus Plans and Long-term Incentives were used as the inputs to the DEA model and company performance and size, measured by Return on Equity (ROE) and Total Assets respectively, were used as the outputs to the model. The empirical results prove that the DEA can be successfully applied as a benchmarking model for CEO remuneration that incorporates multiple inputs and outputs and establishes benchmarks and potential improvements for overpaid, inefficient CEOs. The CEOs from 80 of the 221 companies included in the sample emerged as the benchmark CEOs and formed the efficiency frontier against which inefficient CEOs were compared in order to determine the potential improvements for these CEOs. From a research perspective, this study contributes to the advancement of CEO remuneration research by introducing an alternative model by which CEO remuneration can be analysed. Future studies can analyse CEO remuneration by using other variables or time series data in the DEA model or combine the DEA with other methods like the regression analysis to perform more comprehensive investigations. From a practical perspective, the DEA can be used to establish a benchmark for CEO remuneration. Remuneration committees can use the results of the DEA as a guide to determine acceptable remuneration levels and decrease the pay gap between CEOs and the average worker. The originality of this study lies in the fact that it is the first South African study that used the DEA instead of the regression analysis to analyse CEO remuneration of companies listed on the JSE. This study also disaggregated <b>Total</b> CEO <b>Remuneration</b> into Base Pay, Perquisites and Pension, Annual Bonus Plans and Long-term Incentives to provide more accurate benchmark information. In addition, this is the first study that established benchmark CEO remuneration levels and suggested improvements to the remuneration package structure of overpaid, under-performing CEOs of companies listed on the JSE.
