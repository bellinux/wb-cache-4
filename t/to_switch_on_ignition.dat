50|$|When {{the circuit}} is first powered up, neither {{transistor}} will be <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> However, {{this means that}} at this stage they will both have high base voltages and therefore a tendency <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> and inevitable slight asymmetries will mean {{that one of the}} transistors is first <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on.</b> This will quickly put the circuit into one of the above states, and oscillation will ensue. In practice, oscillation always occurs for practical values of R and C.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to bipolar transistors, MOSFETs {{do not require}} constant power input, {{as long as they}} are not being <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> or off. The isolated gate-electrode of the MOSFET forms a capacitor (gate capacitor), which must be charged or discharged each time the MOSFET is <b>switched</b> <b>on</b> or off. As a transistor requires a particular gate voltage in order <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> the gate capacitor must be charged to at least the required gate voltage for the transistor <b>to</b> be <b>switched</b> <b>on.</b> Similarly, <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> the transistor off, this charge must be dissipated, i.e. the gate capacitor must be discharged.|$|R

The experiments examine reasoning about false beliefs, e. g., What willMary believe is the reason that Tom is <b>switching</b> <b>on</b> the TV?, and counterfactual reasoning,e. g., If Tom’s grandmother hadn’t asked Tom <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on</b> the TV <b>to</b> watch the news, whatwould have been the reason he was <b>switching</b> it <b>on?</b> Experiment 1 reveals three effects,first,children aged 6 years make more mistakes than those aged 8 years, second, they makemore mistakes in false belief than counterfactual reasoning, and third, they make moremistakes for a desire changed to an obligation, compared to an obligation changed to adesire. Experiment 1 B shows that the effects also occur for children aged 7 years comparedto 9 years. Experiment 2 shows that the effects occur for unfamiliar make-believe content,and Experiment 3 shows that they occur in stories with a simpler structure.

40|$|Unit Commitment is a {{fundamental}} problem in power systems engineering, deciding which generating units <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>on,</b> and when <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> them <b>on,</b> in order to efficiently meet anticipated demand. It has traditionally been solved as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem but upcoming changes to the power system drastically increase the MIP solution time. In this pa-per, we discuss the benefits that using planning may have over the established methods. We provide a for-mal description of Unit Commitment, and we present its formulation as MIP and as a planning problem. This is a novel and interesting application area for planning, with features that make the domain challenging for cur-rent planners...|$|R
