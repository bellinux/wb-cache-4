60|$|Although groaning {{in spirit}} over the obdurate and impenitent state, {{as she thought}} it, of her son Cuddie, Mause durst neither urge him farther on the topic, nor {{altogether}} neglect the warning he had given her. She knew the disposition of her deceased helpmate, whom this surviving pledge of their union greatly resembled, and remembered, that although submitting implicitly in most things to her boast of superior acuteness, he used on certain occasions, when driven to extremity, to be seized with fits of obstinacy, which neither remonstrance, flattery, nor threats, were capable of overpowering. Trembling, therefore, at the very possibility of Cuddie's fulfilling his threat, she put a guard over her tongue, and even when Poundtext was commended in her presence, as an able and fructifying preacher, she {{had the good sense}} to suppress <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> thrilled upon her tongue, and to express her sentiments no otherwise than by deep groans, which the hearers charitably construed to flow from a vivid recollection of the more pathetic parts of his homilies. How long she could have repressed her feelings it is difficult to say. An unexpected accident relieved her from the necessity.|$|E
60|$|But this {{gravitation}} of women's {{minds to}} the present, to the real, to actual fact, while in its exclusiveness it {{is a source}} of errors, is also a most useful counteractive of the contrary error. The principal and most characteristic aberration of speculative minds as such, consists precisely in the deficiency of this lively perception and ever-present sense of objective fact. For want of this, they often not only overlook <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> outward facts oppose to their theories, but lose sight of the legitimate purpose of speculation altogether, and let their speculative faculties go astray into regions not peopled with real beings, animate or inanimate, even idealized, but with personified shadows created by the illusions of metaphysics or by the mere entanglement of words, and think these shadows the proper objects of the highest, the most transcendant, philosophy. Hardly anything can be of greater value to a man of theory and speculation who employs himself not in collecting materials of knowledge by observation, but in working them up by processes of thought into comprehensive truths of science and laws of conduct, than to carry on his speculations in the companionship, and under the criticism, of a really superior woman. There is nothing comparable to it for keeping his thoughts within the limits of real things, and the actual facts of nature. A woman seldom runs wild after an abstraction. The habitual direction of her mind to dealing with things as individuals rather than in groups, and (what is closely connected with it) her more lively interest in the present feelings of persons, which makes her consider first of all, in anything which claims to be applied to practice, in what manner persons will be affected by it--these two things make her extremely unlikely to put faith in any speculation which loses sight of individuals, and deals with things as if they existed for the benefit of some imaginary entity, some mere creation of the mind, not resolvable into the feelings of living beings. Women's thoughts are thus as useful in giving reality to those of thinking men, as men's thoughts in giving width and largeness to those of women. In depth, as distinguished from breadth, I greatly doubt if even now, women, compared with men, are at any disadvantage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Rationality as both key to {{and highly}} {{problematic}} in modern social organisation {{is a central}} topic for sociology which veers between analysing it at the levels of social action and social system. A Marxist interactionist approach shows that analysis of action must lead to concern for social relations and processes. Both the rationality and irrationality of social subjects are variously limited or expanded by the social environment, which in turn operates as a system of social relations in which sub-systems contribute to the rationality of the societal system. Moving between these levels reveals the processual character of social rationality and adds to the understand-ing of contemporary qualitative change in society and <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>which</b> are involved...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{predominance}} of critical views that East of Eden has a "flawed" structure, that "the timshel theme" is not well integrated in the book, and that the Hamilton family episodes are not organically related to the Trask story, strange to say, East of Eden is widely read as an "interesting" and "impressive" story. How can we explain <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> is claimed to exist between the "flawed" structure and {{the popularity of the}} story? Can we find a view which will establish that the relationship between the major subject matter and the constituent elements is what makes the story "interesting" and "impressive"? In this paper, I propose as a working hypothesis that Steinbeck's "nonteleological thinking" and "breaking through" concept is imbedded in the underlying design of the story, and this explains how "timshel" is integrated in the major subject matter of the story and how the Hamilton family episodes are contrasted with the Trask story in Steinbeck's "contrapuntal" design...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{intends to}} offer a {{theoretical}} insight into the myths of motherhood and how these myths can bear on the pathogenesis of postpartum depression. METHODS: From a man's view motherhood is conceptualized as a necessary stage in the progress towards the attainment of femininity. This view is impersonal and external {{to the experience of}} motherhood. From a female perspective, motherhood presents itself as a conflicting situation. We will then focus on the necessity to construct a discourse on motherhood by using a code which belongs to women rather than men. The analysis of a blog and a comedy show will provide evidence concerning the evolution of the female discourse on motherhood thus contributing to the debunking of the myths of motherhood. The final section discusses ways in which myths of motherhood can bear on the pathogenesis of postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: Among "melancholic type" women, who tend to abide by social norms, play established social roles and hide their inner conflicts, myths of motherhood contribute to suppress <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> is intrinsic to motherhood itself making this contradiction uncontrollable and potentially devastating...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} {{some aspects of}} Leibniz’s theory of time. On the whole, I point out how Leibniz relies in this, on one hand, on the inner experience of the mind; on the other, he works out a logico-ontological structure which underlies the temporal features of world. In particular, then, I focus {{on the relationship between}} change and time. In the first part of my paper I take into account the thesis that time cannot be conceived without change, an important piece of a reductionist approach to the ontological status of time. It is endorsed by Leibniz, who in general professes the ontological priority of the ‘history system ’ (the series of things and changes in time) with respect to the ‘time system ’ (the system of properly temporal items). It does not fail to create some tension, however, with his characterization of time as an order of possible things – which seems to allow for the possibility of temporal vacua. In any event, the relation of time with possibility {{turns out to be a}} central one. In the second part, I consider the fact that time, in its turn, seems to be required in order to conceive of change, insofar as it is taken by Leibniz as the way to neutralize <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> would be implied by change itself...|$|E

40|$|The article deals {{initially}} {{with the}} essential structure of Franco Totaro’s book, L’assoluto e il relativo. L’essere e il suo accadere per noi. Totaro’s discourse begins with experience, i. e., with immediately present being, and indicates its tendency towards an ontological fulfillment, and, {{at the same}} time, {{a distance from the}} full manifestation of being. The intertwining of these two aspects allows, on the one hand, to show the original place of the ethical dimension; and on the other hand, to clearly see the limits of the latter in terms of a manifestation of the Whole of being. For Totaro, in order to avoid falling into the senselessness of the negative, we must consider that not every being is “worthy of being” beyond its happening. The expectation of a fulfilled manifestation of being, according to this “qualitative” dimension, seeks a salvific project of a religious type, which, however, remains philosophically indemonstrable. After having presented Totaro’s theoretical path, and having shown some of its merits, I offer some critical considerations and I suggest the author to rethink more analytically <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> is implied in the “out-datedness of being” and which {{is at the core of}} the development of his “qualitative metaphysics”.

40|$|Abstract – Safety Injection Tanks (SITs) {{which is}} the one of Safety Injection System (SIS) play an {{important}} role in mitigating the Loss of Coolant Accidents (LOCAs) in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). APR 1400 has the advanced 4 SITs directly connected to a reactor vessel. We expect the capacity of the SITs is getting more important since the coolant from SITs equipped with a FD during LBLOCA can replace the injection from low pressure safety injection pumps (LPSIPs). In designing a larger capacity SIT, we may have three problems; the excessively large volume for pressurized N 2 gas, which is about 1 / 3 of the total volume, the difficulties controlling injection flowrate and the solubility of the non-condensable N 2 gas in the coolant. In here, there is <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> is ‘there must be nitrogen gas for pressurization but there must not be nitrogen gas for more coolant. ’ For this problem, the axiomatic design (AD) theory enabled us to define or regularize the intrinsic problem which is termed the coupling and the contradiction. TRIZ facilitates creating solutions on the contradiction. This study proposes a conceptual design of SITs which are pressurized by steam from the saturated water as a demonstration of the conceptual design framework, AD theory and TRIZ. The purpose of this conceptual design is to increase coolant volume and to reduce N 2 gas volume in SITs. In order to investigate the feasibility of th...|$|E
40|$|In {{his famous}} work on vagueness, Russell named “fallacy of verbalism ” the fallacy that {{consists}} in mistaking {{the properties of}} words for the properties of things. In this paper, I examine two (clusters of) mainstream paraconsistent logical theories – the non-adjunctive and relevant approaches –, and show that, if they are given a strongly paraconsistent or dialetheic reading, the charge of committing the Russellian Fallacy can be raised against them in a sophisticated way, by appealing to the intuitive reading of their underlying semantics. The meaning of “intuitive reading ” is clarified by exploiting a well-established distinction between pure and applied semantics. If the proposed arguments go through, the dialetheist or strong paraconsistentist faces the following Dilemma: either she must withdraw her claim to have exhibited true contradictions in a metaphysically robust sense – therefore, inconsistent objects and/or states of affairs that make those contradictions true; or she has to give up realism on truth, and embrace some form of anti-realistic (idealistic, or broadly constructivist) metaphysics. Sticking to the second horn of the Dilemma, though, appears to be promising: {{it could lead to}} a collapse of the very distinction, commonly held in the literature, between a weak and a strong form of paraconsistency – and this could be a welcome result for a dialetheist. This [Kantian] thought, that <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> is posited by the determinations of the understanding in what is rational is essential and necessary, has to be {{considered one of the most}} important and profound advances of the philosophy of modern times.
