5|$|Years earlier, Angier and Borden work as shills for Milton the Magician, {{alongside}} Cutter {{and assistant}} Julia, Angier's wife. Milton's famous <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped {{in a water}} tank from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a riskier slip knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, devastating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden.|$|E
5|$|Borden {{launches}} a solo magic career and hires the silent, mysterious Fallon as his ingénieur. Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and that sometimes he is lying {{when he says he}} loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E
5|$|The player, who {{collected}} all the four Kings, {{is entitled to}} declare tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can declare las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40-round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can declare several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> played, so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.|$|E

5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> underway, {{a balance}} meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a few seconds to recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E

But this cannot be done with, for example, monoids, so {{the study of}} congruence relations plays a more central role in monoid theory.|$|E

50|$|In the 1990s the <b>trick</b> <b>was</b> said by {{some historians}} to be a hoax perpetrated in 1890 by John Wilkie of the Chicago Tribune newspaper.

25|$|A Gordie Howe hat <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> a tongue-in-cheek {{play on the}} feat. It is {{achieved}} by scoring a goal, getting an assist, and getting in a fight, {{all in the same}} game.

25|$|A <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> {{to count}} up valence {{electrons}}, then count up {{the number of}} electrons needed to complete the octet rule (or with hydrogen just 2 electrons), then take the difference of these two numbers {{and the answer is}} the number of electrons that make up the bonds. The rest of the electrons just go to fill all the other atoms' octets.|$|E
25|$|In some variations, {{the number}} of cards used by the opponents to win the last trick determines the factor which the points in the kitty are multiplied by; if the opponents won the last trick with doubles, the points would be quadrupled, while if the last <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> won with a {{combination}} of three cards, then the points would increase sixfold, and so on.|$|E
50|$|When all <b>tricks</b> <b>are</b> taken, {{the points}} of each team's {{accumulated}} <b>tricks</b> <b>are</b> totaled. The offensive team (player plus partner, or the solo player) must have {{more than half the}} total point count, i.e. at least 61 points, to win. This means that the defensive team needs only 60 points to win.|$|R

25|$|The {{second major}} area of social {{influence}} research is compliance. Compliance refers to {{any change in}} behavior that {{is due to a}} request or suggestion from another person. The foot-in-the-door technique is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> the bait and switch.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> to {{cool the}} {{building}}'s thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps {{to be able to}} route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.|$|E
25|$|The South Station head {{house and}} wings {{incorporate}} Neoclassical architecture. The building's symmetry and stone façade {{are common to}} the style. The granite came from nearby quarries in New England. The main doorways are located in a section that protrudes from the curving shape of the building. The doors are housed under tall arches that {{give the impression of}} grandeur while also making the building appear smaller from far away. This visual <b>trick</b> <b>is</b> common in classical buildings and is further amplified by the oversized windows and large balustrade on the third floor and roof.|$|E
