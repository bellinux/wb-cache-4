On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took {{his place in the}} dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E

5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation of the sounds produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although {{the sound of a}} Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E
5|$|In July–August 2012, Kohli struck {{two centuries}} in the five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka–106 off 113 balls at Hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at Colombo–winning {{man of the}} match in both games. India won the series 4–1 and on account of scoring the most number of runs in the series, Kohli was named player of the series. In the one-off T20I that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first T20I fifty, and won the player of the series award. Kohli scored his second Test century at Bangalore during New Zealand's tour of India and won his first man of the match award in Test cricket. India won the two-match series 2–0, and Kohli {{averaged}} 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings. In the subsequent T20I series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but India lost the match by one run and the series 1–0. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> form during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches {{at an average of}} 46.25. He hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against Afghanistan in the group stage and 78* against Pakistan in the Super Eights, winning man of the match for both innings.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E
5|$|Two red keto-carotenoid pigments, {{canthaxanthin}} and adonirubin, {{are responsible}} for the redness in the red-capped robin's plumage. The birds are unable to synthesize these compounds themselves, and hence need to obtain them from their food. Carotenoids are costly to metabolise and are also required for use in immune function, hence birds need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> condition to have enough left for use in red feathers. This makes red plumage a good advertisement to prospective mates. A 2001 field study at Terrick Terrick National Park in Victoria found that males who had greater reproductive success and were in better condition moulted into a brighter plumage the following year. However, male age and condition at the time were more likely to predict mating success for the following breeding season. Adult males can breed at one year of age and may do so while yet in non-breeding plumage, but they are less successful at reproducing at this age. The oldest recorded age is 5 years and 7 months for a bird banded near Beverley, Western Australia, in 1990.|$|E

A {{large part of}} the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the Bourbon Restoration, making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put in a dark room which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal.

25|$|The church teaches what {{it calls}} the law of chastity, a moral code that its members must follow <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>good</b> {{standing}} with the church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits sexual relations between individuals who are not married, adultery, and sexual relations between gay and lesbian partners whether married or not. The law also prohibits other sexual behavior, such as bestiality and masturbation, as well as mental behavior such as lust, sexual fantasy, and viewing of pornography. The church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable sexual behavior between legally married couples. Sex in marriage {{is seen as a}} means for expressing and building joy, unity, love, and oneness, as well as for producing children.|$|E
