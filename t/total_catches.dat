5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell earned preseason first-team All-Pac-10 honors from The Sporting News and Lindy's Sports {{before the}} 2000 season as he {{prepared}} to take over the starting wide receiver job following Farmer's graduation. Mitchell, along with teammate Poli-Dixon, was named to the Fred Biletnikoff Award watchlist for the best wide receiver in college football during the preseason. In the season-opener against third-ranked Alabama, Mitchell threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Poli-Dixon on a trick play in the first quarter and made a 46-yard touchdown reception from McCann in the third quarter. He finished the game with four catches for 91yards in the upset win. In the 24–21 win over Fresno State on September 9, Mitchell led the team in receiving with six receptions for 58yards and a 20-yard touchdown pass from McCann. Mitchell's catches went into the double-digits against third-ranked Michigan, as he had ten receptions for 137yards in the 23–20 upset win on September 16. On September 23, {{in the third quarter of}} a 29–10 loss against Oregon, Mitchell caught what appeared to be a touchdown in the corner of the end zone, but was ruled out-of-bounds by the officials. The Bruins settled for a field goal on the drive and Mitchell explained after the game that [...] "I knew it was a touchdown, you knew it was a touchdown, everybody does. The ref knew it too because he looked at me like he was sorry." [...] On the next series, however, Mitchell caught a 54-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Bennett. Mitchell finished the game with eight receptions for 158yards. In a 38–31 comeback win over Arizona State on September 30, he caught two touchdown passes from Cory Paus in the third quarter, one of which was for 80yards, and had four <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> for 125yards in the game.

40|$|Exploiting several {{fish species}} {{simultaneously}} reduces variability in daily catches. The reduction {{depends on the}} number of species, the catch-frequency distributions of individual species, and the level of co-occurrence of species in the catch.

Theoretical findings are tested with an example from a stationary lift-net fishery for schooling small pelagic species around Ambon Island in the Central Moluccas, Indonesia. This fishery catches over 30 species, all with high daily variability (CV= 2. 2 – 13. 4). The reduction of variability in the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> (CV= 1. 7) {{is a result of the}} dominance and independent occurrence of the three main species.

40|$|Longitudinal {{surveys of}} anglers or boat owners {{are widely used}} in {{recreational}} fishery management to estimate <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> over a fishing season. Survey designs with repeated measures of the same random sample over time are effective {{if the goal is}} to show statistically significant differences among point estimates for successive time intervals. However, estimators for <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> over the season that are based on longitudinal sampling will be less precise than stratified estimators based on successive independent samples. Conventional stratified variance estimators would be negatively biased if applied to such data because the samples for different time strata are not independent. We formulated new general estimators for <b>catch</b> rate, <b>total</b> <b>catch,</b> and respective variances that sum across time strata but also account for correlation stratum samples. A case study of the Japanese recreational fishery for ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) showed that the conventional stratified variance estimate of <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> was about 10 % of the variance estimated by our new method. Combining the catch data for each angler or boat owners throughout the season reduced the variance of the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> estimate by about 75 %. For successive independent surveys based on random independent samples, catch, and variance estimators derived from combined data would be the same as conventional stratified estimators when sample allocation is proportional to strata size.

50|$|In the North-East Atlantic <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> {{decreased}} {{between the}} mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons in 2013. Blue whiting reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but {{was down to}} 628,000 tons in 2013. Recovery plans for cod, sole, and plaice have reduced mortality in these species. Arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s-1980s but is now recovered. Arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished; Sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished. Limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep-water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing. Stocks of northern shrimp and Norwegian lobster are in good condition. In the North-East Atlantic 21% of stocks are considered overfished.|$|E
40|$|One {{strategy}} for estimating <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> is to employ two separate surveys that independently estimate total fishing effort and catch rate with the estimator for <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> formed by their product.

50|$|Fishing in {{particular}} is extremely important to the local economy. Fishing provides {{the primary source of}} meat for these villagers, with fish comprising 56.3 percent of protein in the local diet. The average household consumes 83.2 kg fish protein each year compared to the Laos national average of 8-10 kg /year. Among these households, 50% supplement family income by selling fish to traders in their villages. In total villagers harvest more than 55 indigenous species from in the Nam Ngum reservoir annually. In recent years the excess harvesting of the Nam Ngum reservoir has greatly reduced the biodiversity of the reservoir, and made fishing more difficult. Many ecologists have criticized the state of Laos for failing to effectively manage reservoir fishing. Annual fish production in the reservoir from 1979 to 1983 was estimated at 1,472 tons or 37 kg /ha. Since then, harvest rates and productivity have decreased substantially to about 20 kg/ha by 1988, resulting in a total estimated fish production of some 740 tonnes per year. Considering that reliable fish catch assessments are extremely difficult the actual situation may be even worse. Nonetheless, the catch statistics available indicate that the reservoir fishery has progressively shifted from the large-bodied top-predators to small-bodied, low-value planktivores. This trend of fishing down food webs is common in fisheries. The data available evidences the trend of individual fishers experience more <b>total</b> <b>catches,</b> but lesser returns from the small fish harvested. Many researchers examining the problem have suggested giving local villages more control over the regulation of fishing in the reservoir, to facilitate more sustainable fishing practices.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1940 and the mid-1960s, {{the annual}} world catch {{of the five}} {{principal}} market species of tunas rose from about 300 thousand tons to about 1 million tons, most of it taken by hook and line. With the development of purse-seine nets, now the predominant gear, catches have risen to more than 4 million tons annually {{during the last few}} years. Of these catches, about 68 percent are from the Pacific Ocean, 22 percent from the Indian Ocean, and the remaining 10 percent from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Skipjack makes up about 60 percent of the catch, followed by yellowfin (24 percent), bigeye (10 percent), albacore (5 percent), and bluefin the remainder. Purse-seines take about 62 percent of the world production, longline about 14 percent, pole and line about 11 percent, {{and a variety of other}} gears the remainder 3. The Australian government alleged in 2006 that Japan had illegally overfished southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes; the value of such overfishing would be as much as US$2 billion. Such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks. According to the WWF, [...] "Japan's huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial extinction unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas". [...] Japan's Fisheries Research Agency counters that Australian and New Zealand tuna fishing companies under-report their <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> of southern bluefin tuna and ignore internationally mandated total allowable catch totals.|$|E
