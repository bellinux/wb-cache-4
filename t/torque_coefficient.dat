In this paper, an {{analytical}} expression of <b>torque</b> <b>coefficient</b> associated with {{tip speed ratio}} and airfoil lift drag ratio of wind turbine with ideal chord has been deduced by integrating along the blade wingspan using the blade element-momentum theory, {{which can be used}} for pre-estimating <b>torque</b> <b>coefficient</b> of actual wind turbine in design. Further, considering ideal fluid environment (the drag coefficient is close to 0), an expression of the highest performance of torque only associated with tip speed ratio has been deduced too, which is the highest boundary of <b>torque</b> <b>coefficient</b> of any actual wind turbine with same tip speed ratio. The results show that for the wind turbine in steady operation state when the tip speed ratio is about 0. 635, there is a theoretical limit of the <b>torque</b> <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 401; if the tip speed ratio is greater than 6, the <b>torque</b> <b>coefficient</b> is unlikely to exceed 0. 1.

A semi-empirical method is developed in this study to determine the drag/lift and <b>torque</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a fast-moving rigid body in a water column. The theoretical part is to derive the relationships (called diagnostic relationships) between (drag, lift, and <b>torque)</b> <b>coefficients</b> and (position and orientation) of the rigid body from the three momentum equations and the three moment of momentum equations. The empirical part is to collect data of trajectory and orientation of a fast-moving rigid body using multiple high-speed video cameras (10, 000 Hz). Substitution of the digital photographic data into the theoretical relationships leads to semi-empirical formulas of drag/lift and <b>torque</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which are functions of the Reynolds number, attack angle, and rotation rate.

Three adaptive computation algorithms including Kalman filtering, Adaline, and recursive least squares have been compared to estimate the synchronizing and damping <b>torque</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The steady-state performance of the three adaptive techniques is compared with the conventional static least squares technique by conducting computer simulations at different loading conditions. The algorithms are compared to each other in terms of speed of convergence and accuracy. The recursive least squares estimation offers several advantages including significant reduction in computing time and computational complexity. The tendency of an unsupplemented static exciter to degrade the system damping for medium and heavy loading is verified. Consequently, a power system stabilizer whose parameters are adjusted to compensate for variations in the system loading is designed using phase compensation method.
