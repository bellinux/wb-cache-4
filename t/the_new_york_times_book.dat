5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{received}} the Ambassador Book Award, Spain's Santiago de Compostela Literary Prize, and the Great Lakes Book Award.
