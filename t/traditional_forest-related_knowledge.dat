40|$|This chapter {{examines}} some of {{the main}} research methodologies for studying <b>traditional</b> <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge</b> (TFRK). Initially, we address ethical issues, asking, for example, what constitutes proper handling of research results. The relationship between TFRK and modern science is then discussed from a methodological perspective, after which an account of {{some of the}} main methods used for studying such knowledge—including participant observation, interviews, cultural domain analysis, questionnaires, and workshops—is provided. Ethnographic approaches are recommended for documenting both verbal and tacit knowledge embedded in skills and practices, while the tools of cultural domain analysis allow for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of individual variation in knowledge. Finally, recurring elements of best practice are presented. If ethical and methodological questions are not addressed in a consistent and systematic manner from the outset of the research, the rights of TFRK owners may well be infringed, meaning that benefits will not accrue to the owners and that access to resources (such as genetic resources) may be suddenly curtailed. Thus, all parties must address the challenges raised by the maintenance, use, and protection of <b>traditional</b> <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge</b> when there is interaction between the holders and users of such knowledge...|$|E

Among its many tasks {{is to develop}} and facilitate a protocol for the exchange of information between traditional and western scientific forest knowledge in forest management. It is developing larger regional networks of contributing members representing the forest science {{community as well as}} individuals and organizations that represent and/or promote the interests of holders and users of <b>traditional</b> <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge...</b>|$|E
40|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} worldwide {{are heavily}} influenced by human activities. Information on these human activities are key for understanding ecosystem dynamics, especially as some of these human activities have long-term consequences, i. e. legacy effects. We assessed the diversity of forest uses across the Swiss Alps and the respective <b>traditional</b> <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge</b> (TFRK) by conducting 56 oral history interviews in five regions. As TFRK tends to be underrepresented in written records, oral history proves {{to be a very}} valuable approach. We classified the information gathered in 61 specific forest use practices, characterized by activity, product and use, in order to gain a comprehensive picture of the regional variability but also cross-regional ubiquity of certain forest uses. Based on these results we are able to name the ecologically most relevant forest uses which were most likely, or potentially occurring in Central European forests. We suggest a simple, systematic historical assessment of these relevant forest uses to be applied in all studies on forest ecosystems. This procedure will enable scientists to better evaluate to what degree human activities had an impact on forest ecosystem dynamics in their study area...|$|E
5000|$|The European Forest Institute (EFI) is an {{international}} organization established by the European states.It has 28 Member Countries, and c. 115 member organizations from 37 different countries working in diverse research fields. EFI provides <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge</b> around three interconnected and interdisciplinary themes: bioeconomy, resilience and governance.|$|R
50|$|Following the Earth Summit, the UN {{established}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and its successor, the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), {{to implement the}} Forest Principles and Chapter 11 of Agenda 21. From 1995 to 2000, the IPF/IFF processes dealt with such issues as underlying causes of deforestation; <b>traditional</b> <b>forest-related</b> knowledge; international cooperation in financial assistance and technology transfer; development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management; and trade and environment. The IPF/IFF processes resulted {{in a set of}} 270 proposals for action for the promotion of the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests.|$|R
5000|$|EFI conducts {{research}} and provides policy support on forest related issues. Further, it facilitate and stimulates forest related networking {{as well as}} promotes the supply of unbiased and policy relevant information on forests and forestry. It also advocates for forest {{research and}} for scientifically sound information {{as a basis for}} policy-making on forests. [...] EFI excels in carrying out projects at the European level, and has a track record of over 30 projects carried out for the European Commission DGs during the past few years. EFI puts increasing emphasis on cross-sectoral approaches in its research and development activities. It is thus in a good position to have efficient access to social, economic and environmental expertise covering all of Europe’s bio-geographical regions. The work in the field of policy support includes enhanced support for decision takers and policy makers. For example, the high-level forum on forests, ThinkForest, brings together high-level policy makers and leading European forest scientists to generate science-policy dialogue on strategic forest-related issues. EFI is quickly becoming a leading science-policy platform providing <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge</b> to build a sustainable future: connecting knowledge to action.|$|R
40|$|Common {{lands are}} known for the {{management}} problems they experience as well for their unique contributions to local communities cultural heritage. Forest knowledge {{and management of the}} commons represents a relevant component of this heritage that is being progressively lost when critical management problems are not solved. Sustainable development actions that, through participatory processes, involve the community in strategy design and implementation, offer a great opportunity to preserve commons cultural heritage and take best advantage of available knowledge. ForEnCarb is a pilot project financed by the Sustainable Development Service of Sardinia's regional administration, with scientific support of Sassari University. The project goal is to promote sustainable development of Seneghe, a local community of inner Sardinia, by effectively implementing provisions of the international agreements to combat climate change through forestplanning programs. Most of Seneghe's forest area is in common land. For countless generations its residents have been entitled to collect wood, to hunt and to graze their cattle and sheep on these lands. In support of a process towards sustainable forestmanagement, our study focused on the social and cultural heritage of the local community and the historical development of its territorial identity, with specific reference to <b>forest-related</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The paper presents the first results of an analysis of forest service archive documents and town council deliberations found in municipal and state archives. The sources used include the documentation from the 19 th and 20 th centuries, but enlighten only fragments of history since a large number of potentially useful documents have been lost or destroyed. Results include a time series analysis of allowances for cattle access, wood withdrawal and occurrence of forest fires. We conclude that woodlands subject to common rights carry a high symbolic value for this community, but social sensitivity concerning forestmanagement practices, while necessary, is not sufficient to encourage sustainable practices. Integration in sustainable development processes, such as this climate change mitigation project, offers hope to reverse such a cultural decline...|$|R
