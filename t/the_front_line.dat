5|$|Stephen {{returns to}} England briefly, and finds relief at {{being able to}} enjoy the Norfolk {{countryside}} away from the trenches. When he meets Jeanne again on the way back, he tells her how he dreads returning to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> after leave. Weir, Stephen's closest friend, is eventually killed by a sniper's bullet while in a trench out on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite this, Edward {{witnessed}} trench warfare first-hand {{and visited}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> {{as often as}} he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, made him popular among veterans of the conflict. Edward undertook his first military flight in 1918, and later gained a pilot's licence.|$|E
5000|$|When the Taliban seized {{him it was}} {{in order}} to {{forcibly}} conscript him and send him to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> By accepting <b>the</b> position at Ariana {{he was able to}} avoid being press-ganged to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Once he {{returned}} to his unit, Kouma attempted to resupply his tank and return to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> wounded Kouma was ordered to evacuate for medical treatment.

5|$|In 1986, Mugabe became {{chair of}} the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a {{position}} that he retained until 1989. As the leader of one of <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> <b>Line</b> States, the countries bordering apartheid South Africa, he gained credibility within the anti-apartheid movement.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{large number}} of Germans poured through the breach in the Roman {{frontline}} and charged the centre of the Roman rear line. This position was held by the elite Primani legion, which stopped the German attack in its tracks and then counterattacked, routing the breakthrough force. The breach in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> was presumably filled, either by the separated wings of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> reconnecting, or by the Primani advancing from the rear line (Ammianus does not specify which). <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> now extended on the left flank by the rear line left wing, (and presumably by Severus' victorious division), began pushing the Germans back, and gradually hemmed them in from the flanks. At this point, the Germans were already exhausted and demoralised by their lack of progress and severe losses. The mass of their army was now trapped in an ever-tighter Roman crescent, with the troops on the edges being methodically cut down and the ones in the middle packed tightly together and unable to move. Finally, after more relentless pressure from the Romans, the German line collapsed: as panic spread through their ranks, the Germans broke formation and ran for their lives. Many did not run fast enough: pursued {{all the way to the}} Rhine by Roman cavalry and infantry, many were cut down as they ran. Large numbers attempted to swim across the river, but many drowned, hit by Roman missiles or weighed down by their armour.|$|E
5|$|The main Axis {{opposition}} was Kampfgruppe von Herff, positioned {{on the desert}} plateau. It included 30–50 tanks of the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment 5, an Italian motorised infantry battalion of the Trento Division, and supporting arms. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> area around Halfaya Pass was defended by two companies of Bersaglieri—well trained Italian motorised infantry—with artillery support.|$|E

However, the Pentagon and White House insist that the troops are not fighting ISIS on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> and are still participating in a non-combat mission known as “train, advise and assist.” ...|$|R

5|$|These {{divisions}} holding <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> {{from the}} Mediterranean Sea where they faced the XXI Corps, {{and into the}} Judean Hills where they faced the XX Corps, were highly regarded veteran formations in the Ottoman Army. In particular, the 7th and 19th Infantry Divisions, had fought with distinction in the Gallipoli Campaign as part of Esat Pasa's III Corps.|$|E
5|$|When Operation Bagration {{commenced}} in the Vitebsk {{region on}} 22 June 1944, {{it was decided}} that female snipers would be withdrawn. They voluntarily continued to support the advancing infantry anyway, and despite the Soviet policy of sparing snipers, Shanina asked to be sent to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> Although her request was refused, she went anyway. Shanina was later sanctioned for going to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> without permission, but did not face a court martial. She wanted to be attached to a battalion or a reconnaissance company, turning to the commander of the 5th Army, Nikolai Krylov. Shanina also wrote twice to Joseph Stalin with the same request.|$|E
5|$|With no secure bridges {{over the}} Nederrijn, the Allies {{were unable to}} advance further and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> stabilised south of Arnhem. The British 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three-quarters of its {{strength}} and did not see combat again.|$|E

5|$|With the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery and 1st Light Car Patrol attached, the 4th Cavalry Division watered at the 'Auja River {{before moving}} to the {{south-east}} of Jlil, close behind the infantry and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> From here, a divisional pioneer party reached <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> at 07:00 on 19 September to cut a gap and flag a path through the Ottoman wire. By 08:40 permission was given by the 7th (Meerut) Division, which had attacked the western sector of the Tabsor defences, for the 4th Cavalry Division, accompanied by three horse artillery batteries which had rejoined the division after taking part in the bombardment and creeping barrage {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Sharon, to pass through the gap in the Ottoman front line defences created by their attacks.|$|E
5|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of the infantry divisions, the only Indian Army units on the Western Front were the two cavalry divisions. In November 1916, the two Indian cavalry divisions were renumbered from 1st and 2nd to the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions. Serving alongside British cavalry divisions they were held behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> awaiting the hoped for breakthrough. At times during the war they served in the trenches as infantry, each cavalry brigade when dismounted formed a dismounted regiment. This meant that when the divisions went into <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> they could only cover a brigade area. Before being themselves withdrawn to Egypt in March 1918, they took part in the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Bazentin, the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, the advance to the Hindenburg Line and finally the Battle of Cambrai.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr., USN, served {{aboard the}} , {{providing}} artillery cover for Marines landing on Guadalcanal, Marshall Islands, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Rivero eventually reached {{the rank of}} Full-Admiral (four-stars) and in October 1962, {{found himself in the}} middle of the Cuban Missile Crisis. As Commander of amphibious forces, Atlantic Fleet, he was on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> of the vessels sent to the Caribbean by President Kennedy to stop the Cold War from escalating into World War III.|$|E
5|$|After these exploits, he {{was badly}} wounded on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> on the Gallipoli Peninsula, but {{recovered}} and served continuously {{for the remainder}} of the war and into the Russian Civil War. In 1939 aged 57, he again volunteered for military service and spent three more years at sea, commanding convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. During his lengthy career, Robinson remained a highly regarded officer who had served through four wars.|$|E
5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed to push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion {{was not involved in}} any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line</b> north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E

The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
