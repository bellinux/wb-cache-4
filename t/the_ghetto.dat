5|$|While Gens was {{in control}} of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> he {{continued}} to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> running that part of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes {{was set up in}} March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
5|$|As {{the houses}} in <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E

2500|$|In Poland's {{cities and}} larger towns, the Nazi {{occupiers}} created ghettos {{that were designed}} to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling of food into <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> and smuggling of goods out of <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> organized by Jews and Poles, was {{the only means of}} subsistence of the Jewish population in <b>the</b> <b>ghettos.</b> <b>The</b> price difference between the Aryan [...] and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers would come in and out <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> usually at night or at dawn, through openings in the walls, underground tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes.|$|R

5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for residents of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> The proceeds {{were to be}} split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> and bring it back to <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E
5|$|The Germans allowed Gens some {{privileges}} not {{accorded to}} other Vilnius Jews. He {{was not required}} to wear the yellow badge of the Star of David {{on the front and}} back of his clothes; instead he wore a white and blue armband with the Star of David. He was allowed to enter and leave <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> at any time, and his daughter was not required to live in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> even though other half-Jews were confined within <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before {{the formation of}} <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> in September 1941. He was appointed chief of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> and {{believed that it was}} possible to save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.|$|E

50|$|The {{liquidation}} of WWII ghettos across Poland {{was closely}} {{connected with the}} formation of highly secretive killing centers built by various German companies including I.A. Topf and Sons of Erfurt, and C.H. Kori GmbH. 254,000-300,000 Jews were deported from <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto</b> alone to Treblinka extermination camp over the course of 52 days during Grossaktion Warsaw (1942). In some of <b>the</b> <b>Ghettos</b> <b>the</b> local resistance organizations started Ghetto uprisings, none were successful, and the Jewish populations of <b>the</b> <b>ghettos</b> were almost entirely killed.|$|R
5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E
5|$|Gens and the Judenrat in {{the larger}} ghetto {{were aware of the}} executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when {{survivors}} began returning to <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> by late December 1941 or early January 1942.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ghettos</b> were {{eliminated}} when their inhabitants were shipped to slave labor and extermination camps. <b>The</b> Łódź <b>Ghetto,</b> one of <b>the</b> {{largest and most}} isolated, lasted also the longest (from April 1940 until August 1944), because goods were manufactured there for the Nazi war economy. The deportations from <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Ghetto</b> began in July 1942. They were facilitated by collaborators, such as the Jewish police, and opposed by the resistance, including the Jewish Fighting Organization (ŻOB). An estimated 500,000 Jews died in <b>the</b> <b>ghettos,</b> and further 250,000 were murdered during their elimination.|$|R

5|$|On 3 September 1943, in {{addition}} to his duties at Płaszów, Göth was the officer in charge of the liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> at Tarnów, which had been home to 25,000 Jews (about 45 per cent of the city's population) at the start of World War II. By the time <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> was liquidated, 8,000 Jews remained. They were loaded on a train to Auschwitz concentration camp, but less than half survived the journey. Most of the survivors were deemed unsuitable for forced labour and were murdered immediately on their arrival at Auschwitz. According to testimony of several witnesses as recorded in his 1946 indictment for war crimes, Göth personally shot between 30 and 90 women and children during the liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, {{so there was no}} way to create a unified strategy. Few in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{its history}} {{back to the}} 1870s, <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> now {{includes}} more than 200 university-owned houses as well as landlord-owned houses, high-density housing and gathering spaces. With the inclusion of Holy Angels and The Darkside, two smaller neighborhoods the university owns property in, {{there are more than}} 400 houses currently used as student residential space. Because of the area's age, the university has been engaged in a program to renovate and update <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto,</b> and several additional changes to the neighborhood are expected in the coming years as part of the university's Master Plan.|$|E
50|$|October 1942: According to {{testimony}} of Nuchim Rozenel, from the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, on this month, {{during the second}} Aktion in <b>the</b> Kraśnik <b>Ghetto,</b> <b>the</b> Hassidic rabbi of Turobin was in <b>the</b> Kraśnik <b>Ghetto</b> together with his son and the son's family, {{and they were all}} deported to Zaklikow which was <b>the</b> main assembling <b>ghetto</b> for <b>the</b> Jews from Kraśnik county during the final liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>ghettos.</b> From there he was deported to Bełżec, together with his family.|$|R

5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in <b>the</b> <b>Ghetto</b> ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall of <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|During early 1942, Gens became {{involved}} in a power struggle {{with the head of}} the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> residents, partly because he lived in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto.</b> Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. <b>The</b> <b>ghetto</b> police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in <b>the</b> <b>ghetto</b> is like: her friends, people around <b>the</b> <b>ghetto,</b> jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
