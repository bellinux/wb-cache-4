50|$|For the purpose, the Navy {{collected}} {{somewhere between}} 70 and 90 unwanted ships {{to use as}} targets, some captured from the enemy {{and some of the}} Navy's own.

40|$|By {{disintegration}} of transport plans it is introduced {{the notion of}} <b>transport</b> <b>class.</b> This allows to consider the Monge problem as a particular case of the Kantorovich transport problem, once a <b>transport</b> <b>class</b> is fixed. The transport problem constrained to a fixed <b>transport</b> <b>class</b> is equivalent to an abstract Monge problem over a Wasserstein space of probability measures. Concerning solvability {{of this kind of}} constrained problems, it turns out that in some sense the Monge problem corresponds to a lucky case...|$|R

50|$|The Elizabeth C. Stanton <b>class</b> <b>transport</b> {{ship was}} a <b>transport</b> <b>class</b> of the United States Navy that {{originated}} {{just prior to}} the second World War. The class, which contained only four ships, is named for Elizabeth Cady Stanton. All of the vessels were named for important women in history.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the ships}} was armed with two 5"/38 caliber dual-purpose guns, two Bofors 40mm guns, and from 16 to 22 20mm guns. The 20mm gun would {{eventually}} prove to be of limited use against air attack and later attack <b>transport</b> <b>classes</b> were fitted with more 40mm weapons instead. The ships had a good balance of troop and cargo capacity.|$|E
50|$|The Harris {{class had}} almost twice the {{displacement}} of most its sister attack <b>transport</b> <b>classes</b> whilst retaining about the same speed of 17-18 knots. The ships could consequently carry {{a large number of}} troops - between about 1,500 and 2,000 (and it seems, in more comfortable conditions than those that prevailed for the other APA classes). They could also carry a moderate amount of cargo.|$|E
50|$|Many {{features}} now {{commonplace in}} science-fiction 4X games - Master of Orion, Pax Imperia, Galactic Civilizations - can be found, arguably, originally in Anacreon. The game includes four {{different kinds of}} planetary defense, each with different ranges and potencies, five kinds of warship, two <b>transport</b> <b>classes,</b> and two grades of ground troops. Ships range in speed from slow warp drives (one sector per turn) to fast jump drives (ten sectors per turn), and making {{the best use of}} the different ship classes {{is one of the more}} important features of the game.|$|E

5000|$|Other unusual aspects {{in regards}} to this class {{is that they are}} listed with a variety of {{different}} armaments. Early models had two five-inch guns while the later ships had only one; the Leedstown was at least initially fitted with 1.1" [...] antiaircraft guns instead of 40mm; and Griggs is listed with 8 x 40mm guns and no 20mm, whereas the other ships are listed with a maximum of 2 x 40mm and 22 x 20mm. The Windsors also appear to be more lightly armed than most other attack <b>transport</b> <b>classes,</b> particularly with respect to the 40mm weapon which was considered far more effective than the 20mm gun which comprised most of the Windsors armament.|$|E
40|$|Sources and {{transports}} of CO {{as measured by}} the Measurement of Air Pollution from Space (MAPS) over a substantial sector of the southern hemisphere between South America and southern Africa are described by air parcel trajectories based upon European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model data fields. Observations, made by NASA Shuttle astronauts during the October 1994 mission, of vegetation fires suggest a direct relationship between in situ biomass burning, at least over South America and southern Africa, and coincident tropospheric measurements of CO. Results of this paper indicate that the transport of CO from the surface to the levels of maximum MAPS sensitivity (about 450 hPa) over these regions is not of a direct nature due largely to the well stratified atmospheric environment. The atmospheric transport of CO from biomass burning within this region is found to occur over intercontinental scales over numbers of days to more than a week. Three distinct synoptic circulation and <b>transport</b> <b>classes</b> are found to have occurred over southern Africa during the October 1994 MAPS experiment: (1) transport from South America and Africa to southern Africa associated with elevated MAPS measured CO (> 150 ppbv); (2) weakening anticyclonic transport from South America associated with moderate CO (105 ppbv); and (3) transport from the high southern latitudes associated with low CO (< 105 ppbv) ...|$|E
40|$|Symbiotic {{nitrogen}} fixation in legumes is characterised by {{the formation of}} a novel root organ called the nodule, within which unique organelle-like structures termed symbiosomes develop. Symbiosomes contain rhizobia which are surrounded by a membrane of plant origin termed the symbiosome membrane (SM). In this study, SM was isolated from mature nitrogen-fixing soybean root nodules and analysed using non-gel proteomic techniques. One-hundred and seventy-two proteins were identified as components of the SM, with an additional fifteen proteins identified from peripheral membrane and symbiosome space protein fractions. Proteins involved in a range of cellular processes such as metabolism, protein folding and targeting, signalling and transport were identified. <b>Transport</b> <b>classes</b> identified include sulphate, calcium, peptide/malate and metal ion transporters. Two classes of transport proteins identified in the proteomic analysis were selected for further characterisation: amino acid transporters and ABC transporters. In the symbiosis, amino acid transport across the SM may be involved in bacteroid nutrition while ABC transporters have been implicated in the import and export of metal ions across cell membranes and have been previously postulated to have a role in the symbiosis. Expression of candidate transporters is specific to nodule tissue, and correlates with the onset of {{nitrogen fixation}} in the developing nodule. Subcellular localisation was investigated with GFP-fusion constructs. Amino acid transporter gene expression reduction through amiRNA led to a decreased nitrogenase activity and changes in the ultra-structure of the nodule. A pilot yeast complementation study revealed two ABC transporter candidates are able to complement a plasma membrane iron transport-deficient yeast mutant. The present work provides a comprehensive analysis of the protein content of the soybean SM, and will be an invaluable tool for future studies on the legume:rhizobia symbiosis.
