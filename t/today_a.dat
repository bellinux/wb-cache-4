5|$|Against long-circulating speculations {{that his}} family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced {{them back to the}} early 17th century.

5|$|In 1902 Victor Henri {{proposed}} a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, {{but at the}} time the experimental significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized. After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian postdoc Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered <b>today</b> <b>a</b> starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E

5|$|In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was {{replaced}} by Decimus Burton, whose plans for Bournemouth included {{the construction of a}} garden alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville.
