25|$|<b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> may be {{applicable}} to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment {{are not likely to}} be effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E

There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally. One study that explored this relationship, was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau. In this study, Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children.|$|E

25|$|A study {{performed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.|$|E
25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> the 10th CGPM in 1954 decided that an {{international}} system should be derived from six base units {{to provide for the}} measurement of temperature and optical radiation in addition to mechanical and electromagnetic quantities. Six base units were recommended: the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the International System of Units, abbreviated SI from the French name, [...] The BIPM has also described SI as [...] "the modern metric system". The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in 1971 by the 14th CGPM.|$|E

According to the study, Cervidae diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade 27 to 28 million years ago.
