2500|$|One way of {{attributing}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is {{to measure the}} embedded emissions (also referred to as [...] "embodied emissions") of goods that are being consumed. Emissions are usually measured according to production, rather than consumption. For example, in the main international treaty on climate change (the UNFCCC), countries report on emissions produced within their borders, e.g., the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. Under a production-based accounting of emissions, embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting, rather than the importing, country.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest an {{alternative}} policy scenario, where governments allow the …rms to trade permits in a strategic environmental policy model. We demonstrate, among other things, that with no market {{power in the}} permits market, governments of <b>the</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> {{do not have an}} incentive to under-regulate pollution in order to become more competitive. This strategic e¤ect is reversed and leads to a welfare level which is closer to the cooperative one and strictly higher compared to the corresponding one in the non-tradable permits case. When we allow for market power in the permits market, the incentive to under-regulate pollution re-appears regardless of whether permits are tradable or not. With tradable permits, however, the incentive to under-regulate pollution is comparatively weaker relative to the case of nontradable permits.

Specifically, it will focus merely on <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>countries,</b> namely Australia, Brunei Darussalam, China, Indonesia and Malaysia. The data {{used in this study}} is panel data during 1990 to 2012. The model used in this study is Augmented Solow Growth Model which is classified by restricted regression and unrestricted regression as well as conditional convergence of the Augmented Solow Growth Model. The results show that <b>the</b> natural gas <b>export</b> effects <b>the</b> convergence of the economic growth of <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>countries</b> in Asia Pacific region. In addition, human capital also plays important role in accelerating the convergence of economic growth in Asia Pacific region compared to the other variables such as distance and foreign direct investment variables...|$|R
