5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
25|$|For a {{few years}} we've been {{trying to come up}} with a way for the readers of this site to connect and {{interact}} with each other, to get to know each other better, for me to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> better, and for little bunnies to fart sunshine. The comments section has sort of worked in this capacity, but not very well and not to the extent that it should. So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E
25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> better.|$|E

5000|$|Inter-relations among {{things are}} of course relative, and by {{themselves}} are unknowable. (e.g. <b>to</b> <b>know</b> 'parent' <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> 'child,' and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> 'child' <b>you</b> must <b>know</b> 'parent.' Neither can be known by itself.) ...|$|R

500|$|Reagan {{reflected}} on the criticisms in her 1989 autobiography, My Turn. She described lunching with former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, [...] "When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like you at all. But after I got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> I changed my mind and said, 'She's some broad!'" [...] Reagan responded, [...] "Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!" ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way, and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Link. You didn't expect I'd {{follow you}} so soon, did you?" [...] cried Roger. [...] "Now, I've {{got a nice}} account to settle with <b>you.</b> I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> did with my suit-case, and I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> mean by impersonating me." ...|$|R

[...] "Last year she talked to me because she wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about <b>you.</b> This year she doesn't talk: because I suppose she doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about <b>you</b> any more." ...|$|R
500|$|After the 2007 playoffs saw two wild-card {{teams with}} better records (Jacksonville Jaguars and {{eventual}} Super Bowl XLII champions New York Giants) {{go on the}} road to defeat division winners (Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively) during wild-card weekend, the NFL explored another proposal to change the playoffs so that the team with the better record would host the game, even if that meant a division winner went on the road. The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's good for your fans <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will have a home game." ...|$|E
500|$|Although not {{included}} in the Test squads to face either New Zealand or South Africa, White was named in the ODI and Twenty20 squads to face South Africa at home, and professed [...] "it was a good feeling <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are still in the mix". White played in a more familiar role in the Twenty20s, batting in the middle-order, and after a disappointing 7 in the first match, made 40* off 18 in the second to push Australia's total up beyond South Africa's reach. He had a steady ODI series, in which he was again used as a middle-order batsman, and part-time spinner. [...] He retained his place for the one-day series against New Zealand, but had limited involvement, making 27runs from his two innings, though he did claim two wickets in his seven overs bowling.|$|E
500|$|Series lead Noah Wyle {{emphasized}} Spielberg's {{presence on}} set by stating [...] "Anytime he gives an anointment to a project, it steps up the pedigree." [...] Colin Cunningham, who plays outlaw John Pope, exclaimed [...] "You’d {{show up and}} think, ‘This is not a TV show; this is something else that we’re doing,’ [...] " [...] he said, noting that Spielberg was very hands-on for the pilot. [...] "Its scope is massive. Anytime you hear the word Spielberg, you know it’s {{not going to be}} crap; you know it’ll be quality and there will be some money behind it." [...] Mark Verheiden, who was the showrunner for the first season, stated [...] "It’s great <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> have a world-class filmmaker backing up what you’re trying to do who is supportive and helping design the great stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|Watch Me Disappear was Augie March's most {{mainstream}} pop work to date, {{described as}} a further distillation of the band's earlier, even more complex, music. Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work, despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity. Zuel also noted a removal {{of much of the}} backing instrumentation which had acted as [...] "clutter" [...] around Richards' vocals on earlier work. Scott Podmore wrote in the Herald Sun that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was [...] "a slow burner that takes time to get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> but once it does, it's a friend for good". Triple J reviewer Jenny Valentish argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] as [...] "likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals". She noted a [...] "commercial potential" [...] for the album, despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E
500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs... The children need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are and get up, forgive yourself, and go on about the business of living your life".|$|E

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{calls an}} {{emergency}} meeting asking everyone {{to come up}} with an idea to [...] "re-invigorate" [...] the office. Michael asks Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for ideas, but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he's busy. Michael keeps asking him, and Stanley finally snaps at Michael, and says the titular [...] "Did I stutter?" [...] in a very loud, threatening tone. Michael, who is visibly shaken, ends the meeting. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley, and Michael, initially resistant, decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson. Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him, and does so in front of all of them. Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael's antics. When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson, Stanley is angered and goes on a rant, yelling and insulting Michael. Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it, and tells everyone to leave the office, making everyone think he is about to berate Stanley. The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange, where Michael tearfully (much to Stanley's annoyance) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him. Stanley states that he simply does not respect him, and when Michael suggests that Stanley does not know him very well he replies [...] "Michael, I've known you for a very long time. And the more I've gotten <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> the less I've come to respect you." [...] Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley, and says that, while he accepts that Stanley does not respect him, he cannot take such a disrespectful tone with him, because he is his boss. Stanley responds by saying, [...] "Fair enough," [...] and the two shake hands.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd go like, 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' second LP was a remix album.

2500|$|In May 2013, Walker posted an {{open letter}} to singer Alicia Keys, asking her to cancel a planned concert in Tel Aviv. [...] "I believe we are {{mutually}} respectful of each other’s path and work," [...] Walker wrote. [...] "It would grieve me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists."
