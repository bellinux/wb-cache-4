It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} NY96 between exit29 and NY250 in Perinton {{serves as a}} major {{commercial}} strip, anchored {{by the presence of}} Eastview Mall, one of the largest malls in the Rochester area and the largest east of the city. Also present along this stretch of NY96 are a series of plazas, beginning with one just north of I-490 featuring a Walmart and a Kohl's. Continuing northward, NY96 runs along the eastern edge of Eastview Mall and passes two more plazas, one of which is developed around a Kmart. The highway gradually turns northwest toward the county line as it passes <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> <b>and</b> crosses into Monroe County at an intersection leading to Eastview Commons, a plaza separated from the mall by high-voltage power lines and a large ditch.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, Heather awakens at a shopping mall, having fallen asleep while dining at a burger joint; she had been dreaming of being trapped in a demented amusement park, forced to follow roller coaster tracks in her flight from monstrous creatures and subsequently being run down by the roller coaster. Before she can leave the mall, a private detective called Douglas Cartland confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She encounters Claudia, who hints about Heather's fate. Heather finds herself in the Otherworld version of the mall — monster-filled and decaying — and is eventually restored back to the original shopping mall where she encounters Douglas, who confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her. Heather leaves <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> <b>and</b> resolves to take the subway home. Having arrived at her residence, Heather discovers that her father has been killed by a monster under the orders of Claudia, who tells her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill and leaves.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> <b>and</b> back to the Solomon Building, {{where it had been}} before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use complex in the works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's {{vision of}} a more honest, {{efficient}} and humane city government inspired Cleveland politics for decades to come. The years that followed his death were perhaps the most creative period in the city's history, in which it perfected excellent library and school systems, while completing the Group Plan's public buildings on <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> <b>and</b> the ensemble of educational and cultural institutions at University Circle. The city was frequently cited as a model in many fields of government efficiency and social reform.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{situated}} {{on the site of}} a disused railway station, The Mall Wood Green is still very well served by public transport in comparison to London's other shopping centres. Wood Green and Turnpike Lane tube stations on the Piccadilly line are both near <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> <b>and</b> due to Wood Green High Road running through the centre of the development, it is possible to catch buses from directly outside the shops. Alexandra Palace railway station is a short distance {{to the west of the}} centre.|$|E
25|$|Since its beginning, {{the mall}} had {{been blamed for}} the flight of {{business}} from downtown. The mall {{had not been able}} to attract housing for urban professionals and had not offered a sustainable nightlife, yet it had always been home to transients and panhandlers. Community leaders could not develop the mall. Potential customers did not enjoy <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> <b>and</b> rarely had reason to go there. But the explanations about the failure of the Eugene Mall were not sufficient to address why some businesses and government offices could not survive downtown.|$|E
