25|$|The maximum {{duration}} of each Parliament is five years from the date of its first sitting. If Parliament has not been dissolved before that period has elapsed, it is automatically dissolved by operation of law. However, in most cases Parliament is dissolved and a general election called {{at the behest of}} the Prime Minister, who is entitled to advise <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by a proclamation published in the Government Gazette. The President is not obliged to proclaim that Parliament is dissolved unless he is satisfied that the Prime Minister commands the confidence of a majority of MPs. Once Parliament has been dissolved, a general election must be held within three months.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the duties}} of the Czech President can be said to be {{ceremonial}} to one degree or another, especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the Prime Minister. A good example of this is the status as {{commander in chief of the}} military. No part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the Prime Minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with respect to the military is to appoint its generalsbut even this must be done with the signature of the Prime Minister.|$|E
60|$|The Council of Four paid no {{attention}} to these issues, being preoccupied with others,--Clemenceau to crush the economic life of his enemy, Lloyd George to do a deal and bring home something which would pass muster for a week, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> nothing that was not just and right. It is an extraordinary fact that the fundamental economic problems of a Europe starving and disintegrating before their eyes, was the one question in which it was impossible to arouse the interest of the Four. Reparation was their main excursion into the economic field, and they settled it as a problem of theology, of polities, of electoral chicane, from every point of view except that of the economic future of the States whose destiny they were handling.|$|E

6000|$|The first plan {{proposed}} by General McClellan covered operations extending from Virginia to Texas. With a main army {{of two hundred}} and seventy-three thousand he proposes [...] "not only to drive the enemy out of Virginia and occupy Richmond, but to occupy Charleston, Savannah, Montgomery, Pensacola, Mobile, and New Orleans; in other words, {{to move into the}} heart of the enemy's country and crush the rebellion in its very heart." [...] We do not say that General McClellan's ambition to be the one man who should crush the rebellion was an unworthy one, but that his theory that this was possible, and in the way he proposed, shows him better fitted to state the abstract problems than to apprehend the complex details of their solution when they lie before him as practical difficulties. For when we consider the necessary detachments from this force to guard his communications through an enemy's country, as he wishes <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> in order to justify the largeness of the force required, we cannot help asking how soon the army for active operations would be reduced to a hundred and fifty thousand. And how long would a general be in reaching New Orleans, if he is six months in making up his mind to advance with an army of that strength on the insignificant fortifications of Manassas, manned, according to the best information, with forty thousand troops? At the same time General McClellan assigns twenty thousand as a force adequate for opening the Mississippi. This plan, to be sure, was soon abandoned, but it is an illustration of the want of precision and forethought which characterizes the mind of its author. A man so vague in his conceptions is apt to be timid in action, for the same haziness of mind may, according to circumstances, either soften and obscure the objects of thought, or make them loom with purely fantastic exaggeration. There is a vast difference between clearness of head on demand and the power of framing abstract schemes of action, beautiful in their correctness of outline and apparent simplicity. It is a perception of this truth, we believe, which leads practical men always to suspect plans supported by statistics too exquisitely conclusive.|$|E

Cavalry raids into Mexico during the 1870s meant risking {{international}} incident, but under secret orders from President Grant, Mackenzie pursued maurauding bandits, gun runners, and renegade Apache. If caught he knew he would be left without support by his own government. Each episode ends with Gilmore narrating: [...] "Mackenzie's Raiders did ride again ... and again, carrying out the secret orders of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> ... <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whastever necessary to make Southwest a decent place to live." ...|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, the German President can {{dissolve}} the Bundestag (parliament) if the Chancellor loses a {{motion of confidence}} and asks <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The German President has exercised this right three times since {{the founding of the}} Federal Republic in 1949. President Gustav Heinemann dissolved the Bundestag at the request of Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, and in 1982 President Karl Carstens did so at the request of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Both Brandt and Kohl were reelected with larger majorities. Most recently, on 1 July 2005, President Horst Köhler dissolved the Bundestag at the request of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Schröder expectedly lost the election that followed.|$|E
50|$|As Germany {{is being}} {{defeated}} and its scientists interrogated, {{it is found}} out {{that they have not}} even come close to constructing a nuclear bomb (partly due to bad cooperation by scientists). Despite the fact that no one has the technology now, and the original reason for project Manhattan is gone, work continues. Szilard, who first used Einstein to get his ideas about building a bomb across to the US leaders, now convinces him to join him in writing a letter to <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the opposite, namely not to build the bomb, in order to avoid an arms race. 68 scientists sign a petition, but that is held back by the military.|$|E
50|$|On Sunday 16 June President Roosevelt's {{reply to}} President Lebrun's {{requests}} for assistance came with only vague promises and {{saying that it was}} impossible for <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything without Congressional approval. Pétain then drew a letter of resignation from his pocket, an act which was certain to bring down the government (he had persuaded Weygand to come to Bordeaux by telling him that 16 June would be the decisive day). Lebrun persuaded him to stay until Churchill’s reply had been received. After lunch, Churchill’s telegram arrived agreeing to an armistice provided the French fleet was moved to British ports, a suggestion which was not acceptable to Darlan, who argued that it would leave France defenceless.|$|E

During the meeting, Erdoğan allegedly told ministers that Turkey needed a presidential system. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that there was no legitimate reason as to why Erdoğan would chair a cabinet meeting, stating that the President should give a reason before doing so. The CHP further accused Erdoğan for having an unlimited thirst for power.|$|E

[...] Ogletree has since written a book about the case. Steve Killion, president of the Cambridge patrol officers association, also stated [...] "I'm absolutely pleased with call.

Utah's Republican governor, Gary Herbert, said that he was [...] "more than disappointed" [...] and [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] by President Obama's unilateral decision. Congressman Jason Chaffetz reacted similarly. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, also a Republican, stated that [...] "By significantly restricting access to a large portion of public lands in Utah, the President weakens land management capabilities and fails to protect those the Antiquities Act intended to benefit", and announced that he planned a lawsuit regarding the issue.|$|E
5000|$|The Naturalization Act {{increased}} the residency requirement for American citizenship {{from five to}} fourteen years. At the time, the majority of immigrants supported Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, the political opponents of the Federalists. The Alien Friends Act allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered [...] "dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States" [...] at any time, while the Alien Enemies Act authorized <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same to any male citizen of a hostile nation above the age of fourteen during times of war. Lastly, the controversial Sedition Act restricted speech that was critical of the federal government. Under the Sedition Act, the Federalists allowed people who were accused of violating the sedition laws to use truth as a defense. The Sedition Act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many Jeffersonian newspaper owners who disagreed with the government.|$|E

50|$|The current Constitution of Peru {{differs from}} the 1979 Constitution in that it gives greater power to the president.

40|$|On June 30, 2007, United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab and South Korean Foreign Trade Minister Kim Hyung-chong {{signed the}} {{proposed}} U. S. -South Korean Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) for their respective countries. If approved, the KORUS FTA {{would be the}} largest FTA that South Korea has signed to date and would be the second largest (next to North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA) in which the United States participates. South Korea is the seventh-largest trading partner of the United States and the United States is South Korea’s third largest trading partner. Various studies conclude that the agreement would increase bilateral trade and investment flows. The final text of the proposed KORUS FTA covers {{a wide range of}} trade and investment issues and, therefore, could have wide economic implications for both the United States and South Korea. The KORUS FTA includes issues on which the two countries achieved early agreement, such as the elimination on tariffs on trade in most manufactured goods and the partial liberalization in services trade. The agreement also includes provisions on a number of very sensitive issues, such as autos, agriculture, and trade remedies, on which agreement was reached only during the final hours of negotiations. If the agreement is to enter into force, Congress will have to approve implementation legislation. The negotiations were conducted under the trade promotion authority (TPA), also called fast-track trade authority, that the Congress granted the President under the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Act of 2002 (P. L. 107 - 210). The authority allows the President to enter into trade agreements that receive expedited congressional consideration (no amendments and limited debate). The White House has not indicated when it will send the draft implementing legislation to Congress. (The TPA sets no deadline for <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this.) While a broad swath of the U. S. business community supports the agreement, the KORUS FTA faces opposition from some groups, including some auto and steel manufacturers and labor unions. In addition, the agricultural community and some Members of Congress have withheld support for the agreement until South Korea lifts its restrictions on imports of U. S. beef. Some U. S. supporters view passage of the KORUS FTA as important to secure new opportunities in the South Korea market. Opponents claim that the KORUS FTA does not go far enough in opening up the South Korean market and is a lost opportunity to resolve long running concerns about South Korean barriers. Other observers have suggested the outcome of the KORUS FTA could have implications for the U. S. -South Korean alliance as a whole. Differences between the White House and the Democratic leadership in the Congress over the implications of the KORUS FTA have made the timing and even the likelihood of the President’s submission and the Congress’s subsequent consideration of implementing legislation uncertain.
