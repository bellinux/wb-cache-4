We determine the nonperturbative O(1 /m_b^ 2) and the O(α_s) radiative corrections to b → c+(D_s^-,D_s^∗ -) and thereby to the inclusive decays B̅→ X_c+(D_s^-,D_s^∗ -). The new feature of our calculation is that we separately determine the nonperturbative and the O(α_s) corrections to the longitudinal (L) and transverse (<b>T)</b> <b>pieces</b> of the spin 1 D_s^∗ - meson. The longitudinal/transverse composition of the D_s^∗ - can be probed through its two principal decay modes D_s^∗ -→ D_s^- + γ and D_s^∗ -→ D_s^- + π^ 0 for which we write down the angular decay distributions.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} leptonic decays leave {{little doubt that}} the leptons ℓ enter the WI only through the {{combination}} jµℓ = µ[bar]γµ(1 +i γ 5) vℓ. Theoretical arguments have been presented which make such a world quite "natural. " Feynman and Gell-Mann [4], for example, assume that the most "fundamental" description of a fermion is given by a two-component object which satisfies a second-order differential equation. They further assume that it is precisely this two-component spinor that enters the WI, thereby obtaining the V-A theory. Feynman and Gell-Mann argue in this manner not only for leptons, but also for the "bare" hadrons (strongly interacting particles). This exclusion of scalar (s), pseudoscalar (p), and tensor (<b>t)</b> <b>pieces</b> from the hadronic part of the WI has not been experimentally verified. In fact, the argument against s, p, and t in nonleptonic decays rests solely in our belief that there exist "fundamental" or "bare" hadrons. While leptons may be "fundamental," we have {{every reason to believe that}} hadrons are not. Consequently, we postulate (i) the existence of s, p, and t in addition to the conventional v, a terms in the hadronic part of the WI; the leptonic piece remains the same...|$|E
40|$|Security is very {{important}} for the reliable operation of mobile Ad Hoc networks (MANETs). One of the critical security issues in MANETs is the revocation of misbehaving nodes. In this paper, we propose a trust based threshold cryptography revocation scheme for MANETs. In our proposed scheme, the master private key is split into n pieces according to a random polynomial. Each node in the proposed scheme is configured with a share ski of the CA private key SK, the node's public key pki, and the CA public key PK before joining the network. Meanwhile, the master private key could be recovered by combining any threshold <b>t</b> <b>pieces</b> based on Lagrange interpolation. Consequently, the proposed scheme improves the safety levels in MANETs. The proposed hop-by-hop certificate revocation scheme is based on both threshold cryptography and transitive trust between mobile nodes. Because of the decentralized nature of our proposed scheme, it enables a group of legitimate nodes to perform fast revocation of a nearby misbehaving node. The proposed scheme is highly robust in the mobility environment of MANETs. The advantages of the proposed scheme are justified through extensive simulations...|$|E

Post hoc multiple comparisons were performed using Tukey’s test. There was no statistically significant difference in the flexural strength between the two polymerization techniques. The greatest flexural strength was observed for the effervescent tablets group followed by the control and 1 % sodium hypochlorite groups which were statistically similar.
