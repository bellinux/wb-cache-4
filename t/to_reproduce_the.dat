5|$|Chaparral {{is a type}} of shrubland, {{receiving}} {{very little}} precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire <b>to</b> <b>reproduce.</b> <b>The</b> rare Gentner's fritillary also grows in this region.|$|E

5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played.

5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease.

5|$|The {{criticism}} {{did little}} to dissuade Etty from attempting <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> success of Cleopatra, and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|Byrne {{assembled}} a band to tour for the album, performing music throughout {{the latter half}} of 2008 and early 2009 across NorthAmerica, Europe, and Australasia. He hired more singers than he had on previous tours <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> complex vocal harmonies of the album and was inspired to bring along dancers after seeing SufjanStevens promote the album Illinois as well as the Japanese films FunkyForest and TheTasteofTea. Byrne was initially uninvolved in the choreography, but made more suggestions as the tour went on and after he saw a live performance by Deerhoof that incorporated dancing with instruments. He began booking tour dates before the album was completed and continued writing his book TheBicycleDiaries throughout the tour.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, a {{reconstruction}} of the case was filmed on location in Bristol for broadcast in the 26 January edition of the BBC television programme Crimewatch.

The reconstruction of Yeates' last movements was filmed on 18 January, and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production, over 300 people contacted the police. A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates' body might have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} planned that United States President Ronald Reagan should {{take part in}} the Second World War memorial event in the Bundestag, shifting the emphasis from remembering the past to highlighting West Germany in its partnership with the Western Bloc. On Weizsäcker's strong urging, the occasion was marked without Reagan, who visited West Germany several days earlier instead, surrounding the G7-summit in Bonn. Reagan's visit nevertheless sparked controversy, especially in the United States. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> gesture made by Kohl and French President François Mitterrand a year earlier at Verdun, the chancellor and Reagan were set to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg. This raised objections, since the cemetery included the last resting place for several members of the Waffen-SS.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability <b>to</b> <b>reproduce).</b> <b>The</b> other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes to}} the roster were made before the 2007–08 {{campaign}} as Toronto sought <b>to</b> <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks, and signed Jamario Moon and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents. On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets. Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles. However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed {{the possibility of a}} smooth campaign.|$|E
