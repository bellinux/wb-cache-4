5|$|After the king's {{death on}} June 28, 572, Helmichis married Rosamund and claimed the Lombard throne in Verona. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> {{important}} for Helmichis: it legitimized his rule because, judging from Lombard history, royal prerogatives could be inherited by marrying the king's widow; and <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> a guarantee for Helmichis of {{the loyalty of}} the Gepids in the army, who sided with the queen since she was Cunimund's daughter.|$|E
5|$|In 1374, Tvrtko married Dorothea, {{daughter}} of Tsar Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria. <b>The</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> likely arranged by Louis, who had kept Dorothea {{and her sister}} as honored hostages at his court to ensure Ivan Stratsimir's loyalty. The bride was Orthodox, but <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> celebrated in the Catholic rite by Tvrtko's old enemy Peter, Bishop of Bosnia, to whom Tvrtko then awarded large tracts of land. Tvrtko thereby solidified his relations with the Roman Catholic Church and earned recognition from Pope Gregory XI.|$|E
5000|$|If one of {{the parties}} were {{prohibited}} from marrying by a diriment impediment (from the Latin for [...] "interrupting"), <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> invalid.

5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it may be that <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via <b>the</b> <b>marriage,</b> <b>was</b> instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E

5|$|Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VII, married Catharine of Aragon in St Paul's on November 14, 1501.

5|$|In 1902 Henson married Isabella (Ella) Caroline (1870–1949), {{the only}} {{daughter}} of James Wallis Dennistoun of Dennistoun, Scotland.

5|$|It is {{only with}} the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals. One of his first {{significant}} acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor (King of Bohemia Charles IV) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania, on 20 January 1382. The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the Western Schism, Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.|$|E

50|$|City {{officials}} in San Francisco claimed that although <b>the</b> 2004 <b>marriages</b> <b>were</b> prohibited by state law, {{the state law}} was invalidated by the Equal Protection Clause. The mayor echoed this view, permitting <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> because he believed the state law was unconstitutional. However, legislators and groups opposing same-sex marriages quickly reacted, filing a suit and requesting {{a court order to}} prevent the city from performing the ceremonies. Additionally, the California state agency that records marriages stated that altered forms, including any marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples, would not be registered. The legal validity of <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> <b>was</b> tested in <b>the</b> courts, and <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> <b>were</b> ultimately voided by the state Supreme Court.|$|R

Olivia learns <b>the</b> <b>marriage</b> <b>was</b> fake and that she has duped into a form of consensual prostitution with Thornhill, but escapes and returns home. Thornhill decides to take his revenge by having the vicar incarcerated for his debts.

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} <b>the</b> theme of <b>marriage</b> in George Eliot s novel Middlemarch. It uses {{narrative}} theory {{to explore the}} power balance and happiness of <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> through <b>the</b> portrayal by the narrator. The thesis proves {{that there is a}} struggle for power in all of <b>the</b> <b>marriages,</b> and that <b>the</b> representation of these struggles follows a clear pattern: where the power balance appears to <b>be</b> set, <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> <b>are</b> portrayed as happy and successful, and where the power balance <b>is</b> not set, <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> <b>are</b> portrayed as unhappy and unsuccessful The factors used are economic, emotional and intellectual power, and here the historical context has been considered. <b>The</b> theme of <b>marriage</b> has seldom <b>been</b> studied, and never in this particular manner, including all <b>the</b> <b>marriages</b> that <b>are</b> portrayed in the novel. Through this study it becomes evident that <b>the</b> theme of <b>marriage</b> <b>is</b> important in <b>the</b> novel, and that many characters have been misunderstood in the past...|$|R
