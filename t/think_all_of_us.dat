500|$|Joy Division {{were due}} to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had {{expressed}} a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because {{he did not want to}} disappoint either his bandmates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah (the couple had married in 1975 as teenagers), was strained. Contributing factors were his ill health, his excluding her from band activities, and his affair with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honoré whom he had met on a 1979 European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to fly out for their first American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield to talk to his by then estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film Stroszek, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned to their home. It came as a shock both to the band members and their management. In 2005, Wilson recollected: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were".|$|E

In response to questions by The Times about his 1973 statement, Huhne responded: [...] "To be honest I don't have any memory of it", saying that he was entitled to a private life before politics. In an interview published on the Kent News website on 10 November 2007, Huhne said: [...] "I clearly regret the views and I don't agree with those views at all. I was a teenager and I'm now 53 and I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do tend to move on in life." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 31, {{just hours}} {{prior to the}} {{announcement}} of Castro's condition, U.S. President George W. Bush told WAQI-AM, a Spanish-language radio station in Miami, [...] "If Fidel Castro were to move on because of natural causes, we've got a plan in place {{to help the people}} of Cuba understand there's a better way than the system in which they've been living under. No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll {{have to wait and see}} what U.S. action is necessary.

2500|$|While President Obama {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the decision, stating [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here in the United States were surprised, disappointed and angry about the release", the U.S. government was aware that a release was possible. The deputy head of the U.S. embassy in London, Frank LeBaron, {{wrote in a letter}} to the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond that the U.S. believed al-Megrahi should remain in prison for his role in downing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988, and continued: [...] "Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose." [...] This same letter stressed the importance to the United States of America of a 3-months prognosis, despite it not being a legal requirement in Scotland: [...] "any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Carter said {{he could}} not [...] "ensure" [...] another movie would be made, but thought the {{international}} box office for the 2008 film made it at least a theoretical possibility. In an interview published in August 2012, Spotnitz said he was talking up the idea of an X-Files movie every chance he got, but that there was still nothing happening on that front, and that time was running very short for a third movie concluding the original X-Files franchise to be made at all. [...] He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on {{the fact that it was}} not about aliens. Speaking at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, Carter, when asked about a third film, was extremely non-committal, indicating there was still no forward movement, and saying, [...] "We can get to it later." [...] On August 2013, Carter said, in an interview with Empire, that [...] "It's really up to 20th Century Fox, whether they have the will to do it. I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are interested in putting the band back together", adding that a third installment would be a return to the mythology and that the colonisation date of the television series would not be ignored.|$|E

[...] He has also noted in comments made in 2011 that smaller private equity fund sizes may be better for investor returns: [...] "If {{your goal is to}} maximize your return as opposed to assets under management, I think you can be most effective with a big company infrastructure and a little bit smaller fund size." ...|$|R

We have all spent a happy time; he was universally liked and respected. I <b>think</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have benefited by it. It would not have been half as pleasant if it had been known that you, my child, were the real owner of the estate, and he was acting merely as your guardian.
