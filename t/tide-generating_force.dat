50|$|The {{state to}} which the science of tide-prediction had arrived by the 1870s can be summarized: Astronomical {{theories}} of the Moon and Sun had identified the frequencies and strengths of different components of the <b>tide-generating</b> <b>force.</b> But effective prediction at any given place called for measurement of an adequate sample of local tidal observations, to show the local tidal response at those different frequencies, in amplitude and phase. Those observations had then to be analyzed, to derive the coefficients and phase angles. Then, for purposes of prediction, those local tidal constants had to be recombined, each with a different component of the tide-generating forces to which it applied, and at each of a sequence of future dates and times, and then the different elements finally collected together to obtain their aggregate effects. In the age when calculations were done by hand and brain, with pencil and paper and tables, this was recognized as an immensely laborious and error-prone undertaking.|$|E

The {{four types of}} natural seismic sources that have been identified are described, viz., thermal moonquakes, deep moonquakes, meteoroid impacts, and shallow moonquakes.

The paper {{introduced}} {{the model of}} the additive tectonics stress from celestial <b>tide-generating</b> <b>force.</b> The model can be used to explain the relationship between ad-ditive tectonics stress and seismic fault sliding. According to the periodic changes of the additive tectonics stress, the tem-perature is analyzes based on the temperature data of NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) which are gathered {{for a period of time}} before and after the Hokkaido, Japan earthquake (25 September 2003). It is found that the abnormal increasing of the temperature is significantly asso-ciated with the seismic deformation, even if the epicenter was covered by the clouds. The effect of the additive tectonics stress on activities of the fault is to trigger it at a time when the stress level has already reached an advanced stage as in-dicated by the temperature increase. Based on this model, it is possible to forewarn short-impending earthquakes. ...|$|E

The analysis reveals that the time when the ATSCTF's absolute value on P-axis and N-axis reached peak is same to the time of the earthquake's occurrence, the abnormal temperature increment before the earthquake is obvious and the area of abnormal temperature increment mostly locates to the east of the epicenter, the minimum values’ spatial distribution of the ATSCTF on P-axis and N-axis mostly focused to the east of epicenter on the day earthquake occurred, at the same time, the unbalanced spatial distribution was similar to the abnormal temperature increment distribution, this phenomena testifies the ATSCTF's inducing effect to the earthquake's occurrence from another perspective...|$|E
40|$|Although Alfred Lothar Wegener {{proposed}} his {{continental drift}} hypothesis more than 100 years ago, {{there has been}} constant contention regarding the driving source of plate motions.

Although the tidal force is small, the membrane stress is high. Our investigation suggests that the membrane stress is the fundamental reason for rifting and rupture processes at mid-ocean ridges. It is thus the dynamic source for seafloor spreading and plate motion, which offers a reasonable interpretation of various significant problems that are unexplained by mantle convection theory.

40|$|Tides are {{the rise}} and fall of water level caused by {{gravitational}} forces exerted by the sun, moon and earth. Understanding sea level variation and its impact currents is very important especially in coastal regions. With knowledge of the <b>tide-generating</b> <b>force</b> and boundary conditions, hydrodynamic models can be used to predict or model tides in coastal regions. However, these models are not sufficiently accurate, and in-situ tide gauge data may be used to improve them in coastal regions. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) tidal data bank consists of over 4000 tide gauge stations scattered all around the globe, most of which are in coastal regions. These tide gauge data are very valuable for tidal predictions. One drawback of the IHO data is that a considerable number of stations are located in rivers or near man-made structures or small-scale, complex topographic features. Another drawback is the unknown accuracy of the IHO data. To avoid these drawbacks, quality control has been done in the present study. Each IHO tide gauge station has been categorized according to its proximity to rivers, lagoons, man-made harbors, and other factors that may influence tidal elevation. Quantitative metrics such as water depth, distance to the continental shelf break, and horizontal length scale of station site morphology have been computed. Comparisons among IHO data, the output of O. S. U. Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS), and other data sources, such as Global Sea-Level Observing System (GLOSS) data, have been done to test the quality and accuracy of IHO data. Moreover, the characteristics of stations with large error have also been examined. The good comparison of IHO with duplicate GLOSS stations shows that, as far as can be determined, IHO data are reliable and ought to be used in improving coastal tide models. The non-Gaussian character of the errors suggests that further improvements in tidal modeling will require advances in data assimilation which are robust to non-Gaussian data error...|$|E

A realistic cotidal-corange chart for the global M, tide is used to show that the first effect is the order of the astronomical potential itself while the second and third are roughly one order of magnitude smaller. How-ever, the later potential perturbations produce order one effects in the computed tide because they are much richer in high spherical harmonics than is the astronomical potential. The existence of an appreciable solid Earth tide significantly modifies the usual expressions for stored tidal energy, for tidal energy flux and for the rate of working on the oceans by tide generating bodies.

2500|$|Current {{procedure}} for analysing tides follows {{the method of}} harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by William Thomson. It {{is based on the}} principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of sun and moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality. [...] At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured {{for a period of time}} sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component. [...] Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical <b>tide-generating</b> <b>forces</b> has been found.|$|R

For the case of two moons, it is found that there can exist a critical lunar orbital distance at which two high tides become unstable with respect to formation of three high tides. Bifurcation diagrams are presented which depict how the angular positions of the high and low tides on the planet vary with the lunar distances and lunar separation angle. Tidal stability diagrams, which illustrate the stability regions for various tidal patterns as a function of lunar distances and lunar separation angle, are presented for various values of D_ 2 /D_ 1 and M_ 2 /M_ 1. Generally speaking, the aforementioned tidal instability, and hence the propensity for formation of three high tides on a two-moon planet, exists over a significant range of lunar distances and separation angles provided that M_ 2 /M_ 1 ∼ (D_ 2 /D_ 1) ^ 3.
