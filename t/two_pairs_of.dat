5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

5|$|Horseshoe crabs, {{which are}} aquatic, use {{external}} fertilization, {{in other words}} the sperm and ova meet outside the parents' bodies. Their trilobite-like larvae look rather like miniature adults as they have full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially they have only <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> book-gills and gain three more pairs as they molt.|$|E
5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> nipples.|$|E

5|$|Adult Lepidoptera have <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing {{consists of}} an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{depicted}} Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> stars {{close together}} Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould designated a star Xi Pavonis {{as he felt}} its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.|$|E
5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large pincers {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). <b>Two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess <b>two</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
