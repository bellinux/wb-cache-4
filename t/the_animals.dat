5|$|Ice's pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, {{escaped from}} his Port St. Lucie, Florida home in November 2004.

50|$|In {{the event}} of forfeiture, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter may {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> is suitable for adoption and if adoption can be arranged for <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> <b>The</b> <b>animal</b> may not be adopted by the defendant or by any person residing in the defendant's household. If <b>the</b> adopted <b>animal</b> is a dog used for fighting, <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> shelter shall notify any persons adopting the dog of the liability provisions for owners of dangerous dogs under Article 1A of Chapter 67 of the General Statutes. If no adoption can be arranged after the forfeiture, or <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> is unsuitable for adoption, the shelter shall humanely euthanize <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|R
50|$|A forever home is {{the home}} of an adopter who agrees to be {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for its entire life. There are two basic understandings of the concept. A broad interpretation simply says that the adopter of the pet agrees that <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> well-being is now their personal responsibility for the rest of <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> life. If <b>the</b> adopter can no longer keep <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for any reason, they would need to be responsible for finding a healthy and happy home for <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> and making sure that the people of the new home are taking good care of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for <b>the</b> rest of its life. Should the adopter die before <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> they should have a plan in place for the care of <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b> A more restrictive view that some shelters attempt to integrate as part of the adoption agreement puts conditions on when and why the adopter could arrange to move <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> to a new family. For example, forever home agreements might specify that the adopter will not get rid of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> for trivial reasons, or that the adopter will always be sure that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> will be permitted should they move to a new residence. Some agreements might specify allergies or violent behavior on the part of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> as reasons allowable for an adopter to relinquish <b>the</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If {{the final}} {{judgment}} entitles the defendant to regain possession of <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> <b>the</b> custodian shall return <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> including taking any necessary steps to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> from a foster care provider.|$|R
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins.

Until the new cuticle hardens <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, {{during his}} first days in office, Bluehouse's successor, Kelsey A.

Options under consideration were releasing <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> into the wild, not accepting new animals and closing the zoo after the last one had died, or renaming the zoo to a term that would be considered more respectful to <b>the</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E

50|$|Glue traps {{sometimes}} do not kill <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> {{so that one}} might want to kill <b>the</b> <b>animal,</b> especially a rat, before disposal. However, the makers of these devices usually state that trapped animals should be thrown away with the trap. This is an advantage if the local population of animals have rat mites since the mite will remain on <b>the</b> <b>animal’s</b> body while it is still alive and the glue would also trap mites leaving <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> after <b>the</b> <b>animal's</b> death.|$|R
5|$|An X-ray {{study of}} {{pterosaur}} brain cavities revealed that <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> (Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Anhanguera santanae) had massive flocculi. The flocculus is a brain region that integrates signals from joints, muscles, skin and balance organs.|$|E

5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is {{an antique}} {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis.

50|$|The halal {{slaughter}} procedure used by Nortura meets all requirements both {{set by the}} Qur'an and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority.

Norwegian law requires that <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> is stunned before slaughter. This does not break halal rules, but is not the traditional method used by Muslims. The time between the stunning of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> and <b>the</b> slaughter is about 20 seconds. The killing of <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> is done by cutting the two main arteries in the neck and immediately draining <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> of blood.

50|$|The three common {{activities}} are head dipping, rearing, and locomotion.

If <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> moves into <b>the</b> central area it is as separate observation because the central area is the most threatening to animals. These three behaviors are exploratory and the more they occur, the less anxious <b>the</b> <b>animal</b> is.
