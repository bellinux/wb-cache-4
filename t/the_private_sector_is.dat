25|$|The lack of pledged {{funds and}} {{potential}} reliance on <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> controversial {{and has been}} criticized by developing countries. Though the Green Climate Fund is an important institution for ensuring {{the implementation of the}} Paris Agreement, its future financial viability is by no means guaranteed. The USA had pledged $ 3 billion, of which $ 2 billion are outstanding. Since US President Donald Trump has announced his nation’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June, this money is unlikely to flow in the next few years. Some observers worry that other major donor countries – including Japan, Britain and Germany – will not make up for the shortfall.|$|E
25|$|A {{major step}} {{has been the}} government's {{promotion}} of NGOs, which are a new concept in China. Many of the larger domestic groups are actually government funded, and those not affiliated with the government are required {{to go through a}} complicated registration procedure to be officially endorsed, although there might be a relaxation of these policies in the future. The presence of international NGOs is also increasing. The ability of NGOs to work with high-risk groups, especially those that engage in behaviors deemed to be illegal or immoral, and to provide care and outreach where overstretched health services cannot, is recognized. <b>The</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> also being encouraged to undertake prevention and education activities.|$|E
25|$|BOT contracts. The {{most common}} form of private sector {{participation}} in water supply and sanitation in China is through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contracts where <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> in charge of large upstream or downstream infrastructure without being directly involved in serving users. Experience with BOT contracts has been mixed. For example, the local government of Lianjiang had the 100,000 m3/day Tangshan water treatment plant built by SUEZ under a BOT contract in 1999. However, the water demand had been grossly overestimated, so that the plant lay idle while the local government had to pay for substantial minimum volumes without using them, which evidently pushed up tariffs. After lengthy negotiations, the local government finally bought back the plant in 2009.|$|E

The most recent figures available {{on the number of}} research staff in Morocco are those provided by the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education, Professional Training and Scientific Research in its 2002–2003 annual report. According to this report, Morocco had 17 390 research staff in 2002–2003. The majority (58%) were employed in the university sector.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Iran’s {{forest area}} totaled about 11 million hectares, {{approximately}} 7 {{percent of the}} country’s surface area. Adequate rainfall and a favorable climate have created 1.5 million hectares of dense forest in the Caspian region. The remainder is distributed among western forests (3.6 million hectares), southern forests (434,000 hectares), desert forests (620,000 hectares), and forests scattered in other locations. Supervised by the Department of Natural Resources, the Caspian forests produced 820,000 cubic meters of timber products in 2004, more than 90 percent of which was for industrial use. The largest and most valuable woodland areas are in the Caspian region and the northern slopes of the Elburz Mts., {{where many of the}} forests are commercially exploitable and include both hardwoods and softwoods. Although forests and pastures are nationalized and 12 percent of forested land is nominally protected, forest destruction by <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> <b>is</b> routine. Limited forest areas, mismanagement, and destruction have compelled Iran to import lumber and wood products. In addition, forest fires destroy 20,000 hectares of forest area each year. Between 1954 and 2004, an estimated 41 percent of Iran’s forest land was lost. According to the former director of Iran’s Department of Environment (Iran), the rate of destruction of forestland amounts to 100,000 hectares per year. The cutting of trees is rigidly controlled by the government, which also has a reforestation program.|$|E

2500|$|Labor unions were central {{components}} of liberalism, operating through the New Deal Coalition. The unions gave strong {{support to the}} Vietnam War, thereby breaking with the blacks and with the intellectual and student wings of liberalism. From time to time dissident groups such as Progressive Alliance, the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, and the National Labor Committee broke from the dominant AFL-CIO, which they saw as too conservative. In 1995 the liberals managed {{to take control of}} the AFL-CIO, under the leadership of John Sweeney of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Union membership in the private sector has fallen from 33% to 7%, with a resulting decline in political weight. In 2005 the SEIU, now led by Andy Stern broke away from the AFL-CIO to form its own coalition, the Change to Win Federation, to support liberalism, including the Obama agenda, especially health care reform. Stern retired in 2010. [...] Regardless of the loss of numbers, unions have a long tradition and deep experience in organizing, and continue at the state and national level to mobilize forces for a liberal agenda, especially regarding votes for Democrats, taxes, spending, union representation, and the threat to American jobs from foreign trade. Offsetting the decline in <b>the</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector,</b> <b>is</b> a growth of unionization in the public sector. The membership of unions in the public sector, such as teachers, police, and city workers, continues to rise, now covering 42% of local government workers.
