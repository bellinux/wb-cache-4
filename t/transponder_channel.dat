The Advanced Transponder receives a 7. 2 -GHz (X-band) uplink signal and generates an 8. 4 -GHz (X-band) coherent or non-coherent downlink signal. The Advanced Transponder ar-chitecture incorporates two miniature DROs. These DROs {{are used in}} receiver and exciter frequency synthesis phase-locked loops (PLLs) in the Advanced Transpon-der. The DRO is capable of tuning over 27 Deep Space Network (DSN) X-band uplink channels (30 MHz). The DROs are designed with custom monolithic mi-crowave integrated-circuit (MMIC) negative-resistance voltage-controlled oscillator chips. The receiver DRO design demonstrated a free-running single-sideband phase noise of − 107 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz off the carrier frequency, a tuning linearity of ± 3 percent over the channel locking range, and output power of + 10 dBm ± 1 dB.

The effort has determined the feasibility of the concept with multiple TDMA carriers, identified critical path technologies, and assessed the potential of developing these technologies to a level capable of supporting a practical, cost effective on-board implementation.

50|$|In {{digital radio}} systems, several {{variable}} bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream {{by means of}} statistical multiplexing. This {{makes it possible to}} transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. On communications satellites which carry broadcast television networks and radio networks, this is known as multiple channel per carrier or MCPC. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single <b>transponder),</b> single <b>channel</b> per carrier mode (SCPC) is used. Digital SCPC differs from the older analog SCPC transmission method in that a digital SCPC signal carries more than just a single audio channel (two are used) but also coding and decoding information, ancillary and control data, and network identification data. Digital SCPC and MCPC subcarrier transmissions use satellite broadcast standards such as DVB-S and its successor DVB-S2 along with MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 compression formats, respectively. BPSK modulation has been replaced with newer modulation schemes such as QPSK (quadrature phase-shift keying).|$|R

However, Variety reporter Cynthia Littleton noted that such a revamp may not be fiscally viable, as it would risk piling on additional debt on top of that which Sinclair had already accrued through the spate of station purchases it has made since the 2011 acquisition of Four Points Media Group (estimated at $3.268 billion as of March 31, 2017), and the debt it will assume through the Tribune deal.|$|R

40|$|International audience—We {{study the}} {{multicast}} provisioning problem in transparent optical networks with Mixed Line Rates.

Besides, the line rate selection, routing and wavelength assignment problems should be solved simultaneously, what makes light-tree optimization complicate.

Simulation results validate our model and show that both the transponder cost and the wavelength channel cost can be saved by flexibly using mixed line rates for provisioning multicast communications.

40|$|NASA {{is using}} a {{commercial}} customized TDMA/FDMA bandwidth on demand modem for use with the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) to highlight the numerous services and experiments that can be performed using small Ka-Band terminals. Characterizing the modems proved challenging due to {{the characteristics of the}} satellite <b>transponder.</b> The ACTS <b>channel</b> is hard-limited and up to 900 MHz wide. The channel has some unusual dynamic properties due to the satellite and antenna system, which make modem testing through the satellite challenging and the test requirements stringent. The satellite Multi-Beam Antenna (MBA) has a 1 hertz oscillation induced by the momentum wheel, which causes the transmit antenna pattern to move slightly. This results in a 1 hertz oscillation in the ground station receive power, with amplitude changes up to 1 dB depending on terminal location within a spot beam and associated gain slope. In addition, ACTS experiences a solar induced "thermal event" each day. This "thermal event" occurs when the sun heats the antenna support structure causing the transmit and receive reflectors to mispoint. This results in a slowly decreasing or increasing power density at the ground station receiver as the antenna pattern moves off bore-site. This paper describes the method used to fully characterize the TDMA/FDMA modem through the ACTS wideband, hard-limited transponder. In particular, techniques are discussed for conducting RF measurements on such a channel, the affect that the thermal characteristics and 1 hertz variations have on the accuracy of the results, and suggested means to minimize the error and provide useful and valuable data...|$|R
40|$|Last year, {{advances}} in organic device technology (such as device scaling, high K-dielectrics [1], [...] .) enabled a substantial progress in performance. This {{resulted in an}} increase in the data rate of plastic transponder circuits from about 2 kbit/s [21 to EPC-compatible speeds (SO kbit/s). The organic semiconductor pentacene deposited from solution was replaced by a better-performing vapor-phase deposited pentacene, with a mobility being a factor of 3 higher. The isolation of pentacene transistors in this new process is achieved by an integrated shadow mask, shown in Fig. 1, that results in a reliable isolation of the semiconductor area testified by off-currents below 10 pA. We replaced the organic polymer (low-k) dielectric with a 100 -nm thick high-k dielectric, sputtered AIz 03, resulting in an 8 -fold higher specific accumulation capacitance. That, in turn, allowed for downscaling the transistor channel length from 51 lm to 211 m, while maintaining a high output resistance in saturation - and therefore also high inverter gain and noise margins. A cross-section of this process flow is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows a micrograph image of a 5 -stage ring oscillator realized in this technology on foil optimized for speed. This organic thin-film circuit technology allows to design with lower overlap capacitance and to downscale the transistor channel length, within the boundaries achievable by existing high-throughput manufacturing tools (e. g. steppers used in backplane manufacturing). In this work, we varied the channel lengths (L) of the TFTs in the circuits between 20 μm and 2 μm and limited the gate-source and gate-drain overlap capacitances by decreasing the width of the finger-shaped source and drain contacts, that fully overlap the gate, from 5 μm to 2 μm. Fig. 2 shows a micrograph image of one transistor. Typical transfer curves of transistors fabricated in this technology, having L = 5 μm and 2 μm, are depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 respectively. The transistors are normally-on and their charge carrier (hole) mobility exceeds 0. 5 cm 2 /Vs. Fig. 5 shows typical transfer curves of a zerovgs-load inverters with channel lengths of 5 μm and 2 μm. The ratio between drive and load transistor is 10 : 1. The inverters have high gains and noise margins. The stage delay (τ D) of inverters in this technology is plotted {{as a function of the}} supply voltage in Fig. 6. The stage delay is determined from 19 -stage ring oscillators. The figure shows τ D for inverters with channel lengths from 20 μm to 2 μm and gate-overlap of the transistor-fingers ranging from 5 μm to 2 μm. Stage delays below 1 μS, and as low as 400 ns, are shown at V DD = 10 V. To our knowledge, no plastic technology was shown before with such speeds at these low power voltages. The effect of decreasing the overlap capacitance is also shown for the two smaller channel lengths: shrinking the overlap from 5 μm to 2 μm improves the stage delay by a factor of 1. 5 to 2. We proceeded with the design and realization of 8 bit organic RFID transponder chips, having a channel length of 2 μm and either 5 μm or 2 μm finger widths. Figs. 7 and 8 show the photographs of the 6 ″ wafer and a zoom of the die, Fig. 9 shows the corresponding schematic. Fig. 11 depicts the output signal of both types of transponders. In agreement with the two-fold faster inverter stage delay for the 2 μm fingers, the data rate of this transponder is also twice as high as that of the design with 5 μm fingers. The obtained data rate of the 8 bit <b>transponder</b> with <b>channel</b> length and fingers of 2 μm is a record 50 kb/s. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
