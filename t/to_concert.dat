Later he added a live sampler to his on-stage equipment, which he controlled with pedals. The sampler enabled him to dynamically capture and loop guitar sounds, over which he would capture and loop new sounds, and so on, until he had a bed of repeated patterns on top of which he would then begin his solo performance.|$|E

25|$|The queen was in {{a tricky}} situation, because {{political}} discourse was dominated by {{the issue of the}} succession to the throne, just as her most illustrious military commanders were being frustrated by O'Neill {{in the middle of the}} Anglo-Spanish War. Tyronel continued <b>to</b> <b>concert</b> measures with the Irish leaders in Munster, and issued a manifesto to the Catholics of Ireland, summoning them to join his standard as he protested that the interests of religion were his first care. After a campaign in Munster in January 1600, during which the English Plantation of Munster was destroyed, he hastened north to Donegal, where he received supplies from Spain and a token of encouragement from Pope Clement VIII. At this point the controversial Jesuit, James Archer, was effectively operating as his representative at the Spanish court.|$|E

For a time he hid in the house of William Davies, at Patching, Sussex. On 8 September he had an interview at Petworth with Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. He was afterwards secretly conveyed to a lodge in the Earl's park called Conigar Lodge, where he stayed for about eight days. His brother, Thomas, was also summoned to Petworth. On 16 September Paget met in a wood, called Patching Copse, with William Shelley, who was subsequently convicted of treason. Paget likely also met at this time with Lord Henry Howard, who had come to Sussex from Norfolk.|$|E

500|$|From 1992, Cobain and Novoselic would tune their guitars to E {{flat for}} studio and live {{performances}} (up until then, their live tunings were <b>to</b> <b>concert</b> pitch).

Novoselic said he and Cobain created the [...] "shtick" [...] in order to get off of the stage sooner. Cobain stated it began as an expression of his frustration with Chad Channing making mistakes and dropping out entirely during performances.|$|E

500|$|In 1976—first in London, {{then in the}} United States—"New Wave" [...] was {{introduced}} as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as [...] "punk"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, [...] "new wave" [...] acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated [...] "new wave" [...] and no longer called [...] "punk". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label {{in order to avoid}} radio censorship and make themselves more palatable <b>to</b> <b>concert</b> bookers.|$|E

500|$|The text, which {{concerns}} a sinner seeking and finding redemption, {{was written by}} Georg Christian Lehms. Lehms was based in Darmstadt, {{and it is not}} known whether Bach knew him personally, but he may well have had access to Lehms's 1711 publication , which includes this text and that of another solo cantata, Widerstehe doch der Sünde, BWV 54, performed the month before. The third stanza of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "" [...] is integrated as the sixths movement. The text in the first person shows the dramatic change of a person initially feeling as [...] "a monster in God's eyes" [...] to finally feeling accepted as God's child. The cantata text was set to music in 1712 by Christoph Graupner in Darmstadt. It is not known if Bach knew of Graupner's composition. The text has no specific relation to the prescribed readings, therefore it is possible that Bach may have already composed the work before his promotion <b>to</b> <b>concert</b> master with regular Sunday services, like the other cantata on a text by Lehms.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 2001, {{the other}} members had noticed that Roe was having {{difficulty}} maintaining proper pitch in concert. Although {{they did not want}} to confront him about it for fear of [...] "bruis his ego", they eventually convinced Roe of his problems by listening <b>to</b> <b>concert</b> recordings together. Roe also consulted unsuccessfully with vocal coaches and throat doctors at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The band attempted to cover up Roe's problems by removing certain songs from concert set lists, lowering the key on others, having Truman sometimes take the lead vocal, and using pitch correction software, but even these did not fully correct the issues. Finally, they consulted vocal coach Diane Sheets, a friend of Johnson's son-in-law. She determined that Roe was over-compensating for a small degree of hearing loss typical of musicians who have performed live for long periods of time, thus tightening muscles in his throat and diaphragm and causing him to lose pitch. Although Roe was initially [...] "cynical" [...] toward Sheets's coaching, she was ultimately successful in restoring his voice.|$|E
500|$|Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana, died at Badajoz on 23 January 1811 {{in a fit}} of apoplexy, seized at {{the moment}} when he was leaving his house <b>to</b> <b>concert</b> a plan of {{military}} operations with Lord Wellington. In the Siege of Badajoz, a detachment of the 45th Regiment of Foot (later amalgamated with the 95th to form the Sherwood Foresters Regiment) succeeded in getting into the castle first and the red coatee of Lt. James MacPherson of the 45th regiment was hoisted in place of the French flag to indicate the fall of the castle. This feat is commemorated on 6 April each year, when red jackets are flown on regimental flag staffs and at Nottingham Castle. Volume 23 of the Museum of Foreign Literature, Science and Art, published in 1833, described Badajoz as [...] "one of the richest and most beautiful towns in the south of Spain, whose inhabitants had witnessed its siege in silent terror for one and twenty days, and who had been shocked by the frightful massacre." [...] On 5 August 1883 there was an attempted revolt by the armed forces when a climate of confusion and chaos prevailed.|$|E
