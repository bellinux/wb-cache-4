5|$|Whitney discovers she is {{pregnant}} by Lee, but all her hints {{and attempts to}} tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his wage slip showing how little he earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.|$|E
25|$|Assisted by the American Red Cross {{and news}} photographers, the frantic parents of four-year-old Norma Di Sandro learned that their injured {{daughter}} had been airlifted from the Stockholm {{to a hospital in}} Boston, where the previously unidentified little girl had undergone surgery for a fractured skull. They drove all night from New York to Boston, with police escorts provided to their convoy in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. When they arrived, the child was still unconscious and <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> all that could be done was wait to see if she woke up. The little girl never regained consciousness, and succumbed to her injuries.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} home to the west from Washington, DC, Knievel decided to stop committing crimes. He joined the motocross circuit and had moderate success, but he still could not {{make enough money to}} support his family. During 1962, Knievel broke his collarbone and shoulder in a motocross accident. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> he could not race for at least six months. To help support his family, he switched careers and sold insurance for the Combined Insurance Company of America, working for W. Clement Stone. Stone suggested that Knievel read Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude, a book that Stone wrote with Napoleon Hill. Knievel credited much of his later success to Stone and his book.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{give you}} my word, Minnie, it isn't serious. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> he would be as well as ever in a few days, but he is rather knocked out, and <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> he had better not try to come here. So then he asked Spud and me to come." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> nothing, but breathed {{hard and}} smoked vigorously.|$|R
60|$|She undressed {{him and put}} him to bed. He had {{pneumonia}} dangerously, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1969, Gigante started feigning {{mental illness}} to escape {{criminal}} prosecution. He escaped conviction on bribery charges by producing {{a number of}} prominent psychiatrists who testified that he was legally insane. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> Gigante had schizophrenia, dementia, psychosis, and other disorders. Gigante allegedly enlisted his mother, and wife to help him in these deceptions. The government had many psychiatrists examine Vincent including Thomas Gutheil from Harvard University, Donald Klein from Columbia University, William Reid from University of Texas, Wilford Van Gorp from Cornell University, Stanley Portnow from New York University, and Abraham Halpern from New York Medical College. These psychiatrists said that Gigante was neither competent to stand trial nor to be sentenced.|$|E
2500|$|Thurber's {{behavior}} {{became increasingly}} erratic and unpredictable {{in his last}} year. He was particularly so at a party hosted by Noël Coward and {{had to go back}} to the Algonquin Hotel at six in the morning. Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4, 1961, and underwent emergency surgery, drifting in and out of consciousness. [...] The operation was successful, but he died, aged 66, due to complications from pneumonia. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> his brain was senescent from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries. His last words, aside from the repeated word [...] "God", were [...] "God bless... God damn", according to his wife, Helen.|$|E
6000|$|... “That’s what <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said.</b> It wasn’t so {{very smart}} of them. I had been paying strict {{attention}} to business for twenty-three years.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> {{this in a}} whisper, for the men had not {{yet been}} made aware of the fact.|$|R
60|$|Gavin {{told him}} why he had come back, and <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> he was a fool for his pains.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} about infatuation {{in a low}} and painful voice, and then with visible difficulty continued his opening remarks.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, she quite {{lost her}} health, and <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> she must {{move into the}} country directly. Mrs. Carrington, who is some distant connection, told them of this place, and they took it rather hastily.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you take}} the papers," [...] {{interrupted}} the Westerner, [...] "you must have read of Pete Webster's daughter. The Websters live two blocks north of the court-house in Topaz City. Miss Tillie Webster, she slept forty days and nights without waking up. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> that--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doing finely, sir. I {{can walk}} a little, and my {{appetite}} is improving. <b>The</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> my shoulder {{would never be}} very strong again, but I'm beginning to hope they were mistaken. My ribs seem all right, and in another ten days I shall remove the splints from my arm." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> gravely {{he thought}} he could manage it and he ignored the long {{unconscious}} sigh of relief that Clementina drew.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} in a soothing voice, but his answer only roused his companion to a higher pitch of fury.|$|R
60|$|Kenby did {{not come}} to the Swan before supper; then he {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> had <b>said</b> Rose {{was on the verge of}} a nervous collapse. He had overworked at school, but the immediate trouble was the high, thin air, which <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> he must be got out of at once, into a quiet place at the sea-shore somewhere. He had suggested Ostend; or some point on the French coast; Kenby had thought of Schevleningen, and <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> had <b>said</b> that would do admirably.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} a week Sophy {{fell into}} a long sleep, so quiet and still, that I several times leaned over her to see that she still breathed. This sleep <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> was the crisis of her illness, and upon the state in which she woke {{depended}} her life and reason.|$|E
60|$|At last, Lady Barbara {{was engaged}} to be married to a brother officer of her second brother, James; but just then poor Jane fell so ill, that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> she could not live through the year. Barbara loved her sister far too well to think of marrying at such a time, and said she must attend to no one else. All that winter and spring she was nursing her sister day and night, {{watching}} over her, and quite keeping up the little spark of life, <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said,</b> by her tender care. And though Lady Jane lived on day after day, she never grew so much better as to be fit to hear of the engagement and that if she recovered her sister would be separated from her; and so weeks went on, and still nothing could be done about the marriage.|$|E
6000|$|He turned {{round and}} gazed at Meneptah, whose hollow eyes stared at him from between the wrappings {{carelessly}} thrown across the parchment-like and ashen face. There, probably, lay the countenance that had frowned on Moses. There was the heart which God had hardened. Well, it was hard enough now, for <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> he died of ossification of the arteries, and that the vessels of the heart were full of lime! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think a little," [...] <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The one {{sensitive}} {{place in}} that woman's nature is the place occupied by her self-esteem." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Vietnam, {{the term}} [...] "Bác sĩ bảo cưới" [...] (literally meaning [...] "because <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> so") {{is often used}} with humorous intention.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are wrong}} altogether, Isobel," [...] <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I have {{returned}} to my conviction that the Rajah is a first rate fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{my father}} arrived, three days later, {{he not only}} found himself {{bereaved}} of the two children he had loved so tenderly, but his young wife was raving with brain fever, and likely to follow her babies to the grave. During that terrible time, Nora, who could not forget {{that it was her}} own adventurous son who had led all three children to their death, went suddenly blind--from grief, <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{were in bed}} for months, and, if {{you will}} believe me, {{if ever there was}} a patient little angel on earth, it was surely Harry. He never complained, and his chief trouble was for my sake. At last he got well; but <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> he would never walk again, for they thought there was some damage done to his spine; and sure enough he never has walked. He is always cheerful, and keeps up wonderful, considering.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thar ain't {{much more}} to tell, nor much use to tell it, as I can see," [...] said Bill, moodily. [...] "He never could be cured, <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said,</b> for he had what they called monomania,--was always talking about his wife and darter that {{somebody}} had stole away years ago, and plannin' revenge on that somebody. And six months ago he was missed. I tracked him to Carson, to Salt Lake City, to Omaha, to Chicago, to New York,--and here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You dare not, man," [...] <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> gruffly, [...] "make an {{appointment}} with this gypsy. Think {{of what will be}} said in Thrums." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> {{he would}} {{immediately}} {{write to the}} specialist, {{so that they might}} hold a consultation on Mr Clinton the very next day.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> that he would. What {{else could}} he say? It {{appeared}} quite {{clear to him}} that some of Mary's fears were groundless.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had speech {{yesterday}} with an {{officer who had}} ridden over from this camp, {{and he told me}} that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> you were now convalescent, but would need repose and quiet for some time before you could again buckle on armour. The countess, when I told her, said at once, 'Then we will take him away back with us to Mansfeld.' Thekla clapped her hands and said, `That will be capital! we will look after him, and he shall tell us stories about the wars.' ...|$|E
60|$|When she was {{a little}} more than sixteen, came a letter to tell that she was wasting away in either atrophy or consumption, and that <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> the only hope for her was home and native air. Poor child! what home was there for her, with her {{sister-in-law}} absorbed in the care of her brother, whose imbecility was no spectacle for one in a critical state of health and failing spirits? We were at Arked at the time, and offered to go and fetch her (it was Dermot's kind thought), leaving the children to Viola's care.|$|E
60|$|Then {{came the}} Crimean war, {{and all the}} chances of showing what I knew he really was; but at the Alma he was wounded, not very dangerously, but just {{touching}} his lungs, and after a long illness in London, <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>said</b> he must {{not go back to}} Sebastopol, for to serve in the trenches would be certain death to him. He wanted to go back all the same, and had an instinct {{that it would be better}} for him, but his mother and uncle prevented him and made him sell out, and after that, when he had nothing to do--oh! there's no need to think of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you were}} right," [...] <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>said,</b> as Bathurst stepped down beside him; [...] "and {{you found the}} juggler really waiting for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, 'e ain't; wery {{much the}} rewerse.--But you mustn't speak, sir; <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said</b> we was on no account {{to talk to}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{ought to}} have got {{diphtheria}} himself, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>said.</b> So he stayed on at our house instead of going back. I'd ha' croaked in another twenty minutes, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> says." ...|$|R
