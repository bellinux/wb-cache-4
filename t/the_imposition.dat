5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of a manorial system on the English model impracticable.

5|$|The feudalism {{introduced}} under David I, {{particularly in}} the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of administration by local thanes. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records. However, <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers.

Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use.

5|$|Drapier's Letters is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} series of seven pamphlets written between 1724 and 1725 by the Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, Jonathan Swift, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of inferior quality. William Wood was granted letters patent to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the Drapier's Letters. Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym M. B., Drapier, to hide from retaliation.|$|E

5|$|During 1548, England {{was subject}} to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various {{religious}} and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the Prayer Book Rebellion, arose from <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called Robert Kett, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against enclosing landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|His {{aversion to}} <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of a rules-based society {{led him to}} denounce, {{as a manifestation of}} the people's 'mental enslavement', the {{foundations}} of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.|$|E

He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and {{the coalition}} selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. On 18 August, Musharraf resigned {{in order to avoid}} impeachment. Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision.

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> {{of martial}} law, ostensibly {{to break up}} the demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them.

On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried {{out a series of}} bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} c. 1150 to 1300, the warm dry summers and less severe winters of the Medieval Warm Period allowed {{cultivation}} at much greater heights {{above sea level}} and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying {{areas such as the}} Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The feudalism introduced under David I, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. Barons, who held feudal tenures, had the right to hold baronial courts, which could deal with matters of land ownership. However, <b>the</b> <b>imposition</b> of feudalism continued to sit beside existing systems of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers.

50|$|The five-paragraph {{episode in}} Part III, {{telling of the}} {{rebellion}} of the surface city of Lindalino against the flying island of Laputa, was an obvious allegory to the affair of Drapier's Letters of which Swift was proud.

Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from {{did not include the}} passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the Collected Works. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.|$|R
