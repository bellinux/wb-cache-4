One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited {{a group of}} friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E

5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{water in}} the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, {{almost all of the}} compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E

25|$|The {{accident}} {{began with}} {{failures in the}} non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, which allowed large amounts of nuclear reactor coolant to escape. The mechanical failures were compounded by the initial failure of plant operators to recognize the situation as a loss-of-coolant accident due to inadequate training and human factors, such as human-computer interaction design oversights relating to ambiguous control room indicators in the power plant's user interface. In particular, a hidden indicator light led to an operator manually overriding the automatic emergency cooling system of the reactor because the operator mistakenly believed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> coolant water present in the reactor and causing the steam pressure release.|$|E
25|$|During the 1983 season, Martin was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} most controversial regular season games, known as the Pine Tar Incident, where umpires nullified a go-ahead home run by Yankee nemesis, Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett, when Martin protested that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> pine tar on his bat. Ultimately, American League President Lee MacPhail ruled in favor of the Royals' protest, reinstating the home run, and replaying the game from the point of the nullification. At the start of the replayed game, Martin tried to protest on the grounds that Brett had missed a base. The umpires working this game, however, had anticipated this, and had obtained an affidavit from the crew who had worked the original game saying that Brett had indeed touched all the bases.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, the National Security Archive {{released}} {{two more}} declassified documents which confirm the British solicitation of the United States' assistance in ousting Mosaddeq. According to these records, the British first approached the American government about {{a plan for}} the coup in late 1952, claiming that the Mosaddeq government would be ineffective in preventing a communist takeover, which they believed necessitated action. At the time, the American government was already preparing to aid Mosaddeq in his oil dealings with the British, and believed him to be anti-communist – considerations which made the U.S. government skeptical of the plot. Since President Truman's term was drawing to a close in January 1953, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> uncertainty and danger associated with the plot, the U.S. government decided not to take action against Mosaddeq at the time.|$|E
