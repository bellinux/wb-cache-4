5|$|Sergeant Hallett (Nathaniel Dean) is a {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant and Sergeant Lope's husband. He embarks on the expedition {{to the source of}} Shaw's signal. At the entrance of the crashed Engineer ship, Hallett observes mutated floral pods, which he squeezes, causing the airborne mutagen to be inhaled <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> By the time the expedition departs from the crash site, Hallett begins to show symptoms of the parasite, which worries Lope. As they make their way back to the lander, Hallett's condition drastically deteriorates. Upon reaching the lander, which explodes, a Neomorph bursts from Hallett's throat, killing him.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Homer remains {{oblivious to}} Ned's animosity. He {{arrives at the}} Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> causing Ned to yell at Homer. This alarms the congregation, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces the congregation to give him another chance. The next week, everything returns to normal, as Homer once again is annoyed by Ned.|$|E
25|$|Watson then {{returned}} to the UK, and had a five-hour emergency operation to remove the eight-centimetre lump at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London, on Monday, 24 September 2006. As the tumour was pressing against his optic nerve, the surgeon removed the tumour <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E

60|$|There was a {{creaking}} rustle {{from behind}} the arm-chair. A heavy body flopped on the carpet. Out into the room, heaving himself along as though sleep had stiffened his joints, and breathing stertorously <b>through</b> <b>his</b> tilted <b>nose,</b> moved the fine bulldog. Seen in the open, he looked even more formidable than he had done in his basket.|$|R
500|$|Several days later, two Greek women {{reported}} {{having seen the}} boy walking towards the city of Rhodes accompanied by four Jews. The women claimed {{that one of the}} Jews was Eliakim Stamboli, who was arrested, questioned, and subjected to five hundred blows of the bastinado. [...] On February 23, he was interrogated again and tortured in the presence of many dignitaries, including the governor, the qadi (Muslim judge), the Greek archbishop, and European consuls. [...] Jews of Rhodes reported that Stamboli was [...] "loaded with chains, many stripes were inflicted upon him and red-hot wires were run <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> burning bones were applied to his head and a very heavy stone was laid upon his breast, insomuch as he was reduced to the point of death." [...] Under torture, Stamboli confessed to the ritual murder charge and incriminated other Jews, opening the door to further arrests. [...] Some half dozen Jews were accused of the crime and tortured, and the chief rabbi was intensely questioned as to whether Jews practice ritual murder.|$|E
500|$|The Flukeman—also known affectionately as [...] "Flukey" [...] by {{the cast}} and crew—was portrayed by Darin Morgan, brother of {{executive}} producer Glen Morgan. He would become {{a staff writer for}} the show later in the second season. The Flukeman suit used by Morgan, which included flipper-like feet, yellow contact lenses, and fake teeth, took six hours to put on; this process was eventually sped up. Morgan wore the suit as much as 20 consecutive hours during shooting. As a result, he was forced to go to the bathroom while still wearing the suit. Morgan was rarely on set without being in full costume, and recalled that when he met up with David Duchovny again upon joining the series' writing staff, the actor had no idea who he was, despite having enjoyed an amiable relationship with the costumed Morgan previously. The suit dissolved in water, forcing special effects artist Toby Lindala to reconstruct the suit each day. Because the suit did not permit Morgan to breathe <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> he was unable to eat while wearing it. Carter described the character as [...] "the embodiment of everyone's sense of vulnerability, the idea of something that exists in the underworld of the sewer system and might in fact come to bite you in the least elegant of places". The original intention was showing even less of the Flukeman, but some angles and lighting ended up revealing more of the creature's design. Carter still felt it helped to [...] "get more creepy", as the Flukeman is not shown fully until the final scenes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the dismissal, Sheen had a highly publicized [...] "meltdown" [...] which was {{broadcast}} on television and the Internet. He made bizarre statements in television interviews, suggesting that he was a [...] "warlock" [...] with [...] "tiger blood" [...] and [...] "Adonis DNA", and that he was [...] "winning". He also posted videos to YouTube showing himself smoking cigarettes <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and cursing out his former employers. He told one TV interviewer, [...] "I'm tired of pretending I'm not special. I'm tired of pretending I'm not a total bitchin' rock star from Mars." ...|$|E
50|$|The tenth servant has a severed leg, {{because he}} was resting on the {{roadside}} when a vehicle ran over his legs. He hadn't heard it coming, because bugs were crawling <b>through</b> <b>his</b> mouth, <b>nose</b> and ears. The eleventh servant resigned from his job {{because he had to}} carry heavy books and his masters' clothes, which were already infested with moths because he never touched them. The twelfth servant once traveled by cart, but fell asleep during his trip, after which robbers stole everything without him doing anything about it.|$|R
60|$|While Harding was {{struggling}} with the pump, Beatrice came along the trail through the bluff. Her companion, Banff, one of Lance's many dogs, had trailed off <b>through</b> the bushes, <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> to the ground, and she was, for the moment, alone. When she caught sight of Harding she stopped irresolutely. She felt {{that it might be}} wiser to pass on without disturbing him; yet something compelled her to wait.|$|R
25|$|This normal, human embryologic {{development}} is exceptionally important—because the newborn infant breathes <b>through</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>nose</b> {{during the first}} 6 weeks of life—thus, {{when a child is}} afflicted with bilateral choanal atresia, the blockage of the posterior nasal passage, either by abnormal bony tissue or by abnormal soft tissue, emergency remedial action is required to ensure that the child can breathe.|$|R
60|$|The Captain said this, {{as he said}} {{everything}} else, more than half <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and very slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Baring's goes. The O.B.C. don't,' {{replied the}} American, blowing smoke <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> 'This {{business}} looks de-ci-ded-ly prob-le-mat-i-cal. What-at?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stickin' {{her through}} the wrist with his bayonet;" [...] {{and the young man}} let a long, luxurious fume of smoke trickle <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Who scorns {{the simple}} things of life [...] And tilts <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> at all he sees, [...] Is almost sure {{to feel the}} knife [...] Of want cut <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{pleasant}} ease.|$|R
6000|$|The old man! Cheeky brat! And {{closing his}} eyes he relapsed into immobility. The tram wound and ground its upward way, and he mused. When he was that cub's age--twenty-eight or {{whatever}} it might be--he had done most things; been up Vesuvius, driven four-in-hand, lost his last penny on the Derby and won {{it back on the}} Oaks, known all the dancers and operatic stars of the day, fought a duel with a Yankee at Dieppe and winged him for saying <b>through</b> <b>his</b> confounded <b>nose</b> that Old England was played out; been a controlling voice already in his shipping firm; drunk five other of the best men in London under the table; broken his neck steeple-chasing; shot a burglar in the legs; been nearly drowned, for a bet; killed snipe in Chelsea; been to Court for his sins; stared a ghost out of countenance; and travelled with a lady of Spain. If this young pup had done the last, it would be all he had; and yet, no doubt, he would call himself a [...] "spark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had great}} fun with some Dervishes this morning,' said the Guebre. 'I met one asking alms {{with a wire}} run <b>through</b> <b>his</b> cheek,[58] so I caught another, bored <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and tied them both together!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How should I {{know where}} he went?' said the cobbler, {{speaking}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> in an intense enjoyment of his pipe. 'He went off dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child {{was much}} annoyed, and he said, {{speaking}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> like this, 'Led go! You are hurtig be!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{this goes}} on, my beloved 'earers, {{it will be}} my painful duty to rot this bargee." [...] Stalky drew a long breath <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hidetoshi Hoshida (星田英利), {{better known}} as Hosshan (ほっしゃん。). Another comedian who makes {{appearances}} during the batsu games. His signature trick is sticking things up <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and coughing it out <b>through</b> <b>his</b> mouth. This gag consistently makes the cast laugh.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} ROAM {{is about a}} dog named Nelson, a bright-eyed, {{inquisitive}} half beagle, half poodle. Nelson loses his owners after following <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and becoming lost. The story follows Nelson <b>through</b> <b>his</b> years of searching for his owner, Katey, {{along with all the}} scenarios he faces in-between.|$|R
50|$|Strolling Jim was foaled in 1936 near Viola, Tennessee, and was bred by Ed Gilliam. Strolling Jim was sired by Wilson's Allen {{and out of}} Allen's Strolling Jennie. <b>Through</b> <b>his</b> sire he was {{half-brother}} to Midnight Sun and Haynes Peacock. He was a chestnut with a left hind sock, {{star and}} snip on <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then the Elephant's Child {{felt his}} legs slipping, {{and he said}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> which was now nearly five feet long, 'This is too butch for be!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the {{phonograph}} {{began to}} play. A strain of odd, jerky sounds {{was followed by}} these words, sung by a man <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> with great vigor of expression: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{trust that}} I {{am one of}} those who are on the narrow and thorny track,' said he, {{speaking}} <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> as was the habit of the extreme sectaries.|$|E
60|$|He {{was caught}} by surprise, fifteen {{feet in the air}} above the path, in the forks of a many-branched tree. All saw him as he dropped like a shadow, naked as on his natal morn, landing springily on his bent knees, and like a shadow leaping along the run-way. It was hard for them to realize that it was a man, for he seemed a weird jungle spirit, a goblin of the forest. Only Binu Charley was not perturbed. He flung his {{poisoned}} spear over the head of the captive at the flitting form. It was a mighty cast, well intended, but the shadow, leaping, received the spear harmlessly between the legs, and, tripping upon it, was flung sprawling. Before he could get away, Binu Charley was upon him, clutching him by his snow-white hair. He was only a young man, and a dandy at that, his face blackened with charcoal, his hair whitened with wood-ashes, with the freshly severed tail of a wild pig thrust <b>through</b> <b>his</b> perforated <b>nose,</b> and two more thrust <b>through</b> <b>his</b> ears. His only other ornament was a necklace of human finger-bones. At sight of their other prisoner he chattered in a high querulous falsetto, with puckered brows and troubled, wild-animal eyes. He was disposed of along the middle of the line, one of the Poonga-Poonga men leading him {{at the end of a}} length of bark-rope.|$|R
6000|$|Mulcachy cursed. [...] "Here's where hell coughs," [...] he said. The nooses were {{introduced}} again. Again St. Elias, helpless {{on his side}} against and partly through the bars, had <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> punched. This time {{it was the other}} nostril. And hell coughed. As before, the moment he was released, he tore the ring out <b>through</b> <b>his</b> flesh.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, then; {{here you}} go," [...] {{answered}} Tom, somewhat put out to thus lose a ball which had {{cost him his}} week's spending, money; and he sent the sphere flying upward at a smart speed. Mr. Rover made a clutch for it, but the ball slipped <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hands and landed plump on <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|R
60|$|He spoke excitedly, {{all in one}} breath, and, ceasing suddenly, {{glared at}} Willems and breathed hard <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> in sulky resentment. Willems looked at him {{steadily}} for a moment, then got up.|$|E
6000|$|Capt. G. I haven't smoked for ten days, and I won't now. (Takes cheroot which M. has cut for him, {{and blows}} smoke <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> luxuriously.) We aren't {{going down the}} Mall, are we? ...|$|E
60|$|LILY--[Trying {{to conceal}} her {{feelings}} under a forced flippancy.] What ridiculous things funerals are, anyway! That stupid minister--whining away <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose!</b> Why does the Lord show such a partiality for men with adenoids, I wonder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you see, you {{can have}} my rose. Your nose is better!" [...] She kissed <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and {{transferred}} her rose to the buttonhole of his short coat. [...] "That's all. Come along!" [...] And with her arm <b>through</b> <b>his,</b> they went down. But he knew {{she had come to}} say something which she had not said.|$|R
5000|$|If Pinocchio says 'My nose grows now,' he {{is either}} lying or not. If he is lying, {{then he is}} making a false {{statement}}, which implies that <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> does not grow now. If he is not lying, then his statement is either true or false, which implies that either <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> does grow now or <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> does not grow now. Therefore, either <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> does not grow now or <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> does grow now. But that is wholly unproblematic.|$|R
6000|$|Old Brewster drew a {{blackened}} {{clay pipe}} from his pocket, {{and began to}} stuff the tobacco into the bowl. In an instant it slipped <b>through</b> <b>his</b> fingers, and was broken to pieces on the floor. His lip quivered, <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> puckered up, and he began crying with the long, helpless sobs of a child. [...] "I've broke my pipe," [...] he cried.|$|R
