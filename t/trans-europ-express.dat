5000|$|Screenwriter Robert McKee classifies <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> as a [...] "nonplot" [...] film—that is, a {{film that}} does not tell a story.|$|E
50|$|At present {{there is}} a TEE (<b>Trans-Europ-Express)</b> train rake VT 601 with 9 centre coaches, the {{so-called}} Blue Star Train, next to the Railway Park on former DB land.|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s, {{passenger}} services were mainly delivered by railbuses. On {{the introduction of}} the holiday express trains in 1979, even the former <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> trains came from Dortmund to Freyung during the summer.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the most}} popular {{historic}} multiple unit trainsets are the Roten Pfeile ("Red Arrows") (RAe 2/4) and the [...] "Churchill-Pfeil" [...] (RAe 4/8). In international traffic the <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> (TEE) diesel trainsets appeared in 1957, but were replaced by four-systems electric trainsets RAe TEEII in 1961.|$|E

50|$|Guo's 2006 film, How Is Your Fish Today?, {{inspired}} by Alain Robbe-Grillet's <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> (1966) is a docu-drama set in modern China, {{focusing on the}} intertwined stories of two main characters; a frustrated writer (Rao Hui) {{and the subject of}} his latest film script, Lin Hao (Zijiang Yang). It was selected for the Official Competition at Sundance Film Festival 2007 and Rotterdam Film Festival, received Grand Prix at International Women's Film Festival in France.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> (first class only) {{service was}} {{introduced}} in the 1969/70 winter timetable, running on the Munich-Lindau-Bregenz-St. Margrethen-St. Gallen-Winterthur-Zurich (lines 56 and 57), called Bavaria. On the evening of 9 February 1971 a TEE 56 service derailed on the Munich-Zurich route at Aitrang due to speeding, killing 28 people and seriously injuring 42. In 1977, the TEE service was replaced by a [...] "D" [...] (two-class express) service between Zurich and Munich (lines 276 and 277).|$|E
50|$|These {{improvements}} were countered in the 1980s and 1990s {{by other}} developments {{that led to}} a further decline of the Queichtalbahn. Initial losses occurred from 1981 when the stations of Rodalben, Hauenstein, Rinnthal and Landau West were gradually downgraded in status to halts (Haltepunkten) and their station buildings became unavailable for passengers and staff. Albersweiler station was abandoned and was replaced by a more favourably located halt. In 1982, the 125th anniversary of the connection between Zweibrücken and Homburg, was celebrated with a visit by a <b>Trans-Europ-Express.</b> However, three years later this line was closed.|$|E
5000|$|Left Bank {{directors}} include Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, and Agnès Varda. Roud {{described a}} distinctive [...] "fondness {{for a kind}} of Bohemian life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the plastic arts, and a consequent interest in experimental filmmaking", as well as an identification with the political left. The filmmakers tended to collaborate with one another. Jean-Pierre Melville, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Marguerite Duras are also associated with the group. The nouveau roman movement in literature was also a strong element of the Left Bank style, with authors contributing to many of the films. Left Bank films include La Pointe Courte, Hiroshima mon amour, La jetée, Last Year at Marienbad, and <b>Trans-Europ-Express.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{technology}} evolved with time, {{different types}} of railcar passed through Bellegarde, An X2700 class RGP2 passed through on its inaugural trip from Lyon-Perrache to Geneva on 30 June 1954. The following year, on 16 December 1955, the Culoz - Bellegarde section was electrified with 1.5 kV DC. From 10 June 1959, the Alpazur connection (Genève - Bellegarde - Grenoble - Veynes-Dévoluy - Digne) returning via the ligne des Alpes was operated with X4200 class panoramic railcars. Then on 31 May 1964, a first-class express train, Le Rhodanien, {{was put on the}} line linking Geneva to Marseille. 1969 saw the arrival Catalan-Talgo trains on the creation of a <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> link between Geneva and Barcelona via Bellegarde, Chambéry et Grenoble on 1 June. In 1972, passenger trains were making up to 12 return journeys per day between Geneva and Grenoble. On 1 October 1972, X4500 class railcars went into service on the Valence - Geneva route via Grenoble, Chambéry et Bellegarde, then on 28 September 1975, first generation turbotrains (so-called 'ETGs') took over. They were so successful that they soon needed to be coupled in pairs to meet the demand.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, train {{traffic was}} {{severely}} restricted, and after some air raids stopped running altogether. Services resumed {{after the end}} of World War II and 24 passenger trains stopped at Ulm station on 21 August 1945. On 28 May 1967, the station became part of the <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> network, which had been established in 1957 and only had first class accommodation. From 28 May 1967, the TEE Rembrandt from Amsterdam to Munich and the Rheinpfeil from Dortmund to Munich, with coaches from Amsterdam, stopped at Ulm. On 26 September 1971, Intercity services were introduced, stopping every two hours at the station. Until 1979, Ulm was served by first class only services on line 1 of the intercity network, running between Hamburg-Altona and Munich, although, unlike most other cities served by Intercity trains, it had less than 100,000 inhabitants. The Rheinpfeil lost its TEE status and was integrated into Intercity line 1. With the summer timetable introduced on 27 May 1979, Intercity trains ran every hour and now had first and second class carriages. On 28 May 1983, the TEE Rembrandt service was shortened to Stuttgart, meaning that it no longer stopped at Ulm. In December 1985, a portion of the TEE Rheingold that had run from Amsterdam to Munich and Salzburg via Aalen and Donauwörth since May 1982 was rerouted via Ulm, but on 30 May 1987, it was abolished. On 2 June 1991, Deutsche Bundesbahn introduced the Intercity-Express into traffic, with the hourly Intercity route from Hamburg-Altona via Hannover, Frankfurt and Stuttgart to Munich replaced by the new ICE trains. In a controversial move, it was decided to stop the ICE in Ulm.|$|E
50|$|Robbe-Grillet {{then went}} on to launch a career as a writer-director of a series of {{cerebral}} and often sexually provocative feature films which explored similar themes to those in his literary work (e.g. Voyeurism, The Body as Text, The 'Double'). He commenced with L'Immortelle (The Immortal One) (1962) which won the much-coveted Louis Delluc Prize of 1962. This was followed by his most commercially successful film after Last Year at Marienbad: <b>Trans-Europ-Express</b> (1966) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, who continued to work with Robbe-Grillet on his next four films: his French-Slovak film L'homme qui ment/Muž, ktorý luže (The Man Who Lies) (1968), L'Eden et après/Eden a potom (Eden and After) (1970), Glissements progressifs du plaisir (Progressive Slidings towards Pleasure) (1974) and Le jeu avec le feu (Playing with Fire) (1975). It was almost a decade before the appearance of his next feature film, La belle captive (The Beautiful Captive) (1983), but Alain Robbe-Grillet was fortunate enough to enlist the services of Henri Alekan as cinematographer, the visionary master of cinematography for the films of Jean Cocteau. Subsequently more than a decade passed before Alain Robbe-Grillet got behind the lens again, this time filming a mystery thriller on a small Greek island with Fred Ward starring as the confused Frank in Un bruit qui rend fou. Robbe-Grillet (A Maddening Noise, aka: The Blue Villa) (1995). Before his death in 2008 Robbe-Grillet was to direct one more film, Gradiva (C'est Gradiva qui vous appelle) (2006) which brought once more to the fore his preoccupation with sadism and bondage in his fiction. Perhaps the best introduction to the film works of Alain Robbe-Grillet is the volume The Erotic Dream Machine by Professors Roch C.Smith and Anthony N. Fragola. Also of great value is the volume In the Temple of Dreams: The Writer on the Screen in which Robbe-Grillet himself explains the relationship between his literary fiction and his cinematic fiction (ed. Edouard d'Araille, 1996).|$|E
