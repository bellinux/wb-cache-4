S. which allows a patent applicant to voluntarily delay issue of a patent. The paper investigates the affect that continuation use has had upon patent grant lags, evaluating whether routinely used research methods that ignore continuation delays may be improved by accounting for continuations in patents' application lineage. This paper demonstrates conclusively that a sizeable share of patent applicants employs the continuation, that continuation use by patent applicants results in substantial additional delay in the <b>time-to-grant</b> statistics for associated issued patents, and that significant changes in the pattern of continuation use have occurred since Congress enacted legislative amendments intended to curb the procedureâ€™s use. Evidence provided in this paper supports a contention that the continuation has been economically important in shaping the environment for innovation, influencing industrial organization, and social welfare. The paper also demonstrates that continuation practice is common in overall US patenting, and that in som...|$|E
