The data does not support the well-known concept of the heat of the foehn being a result of latent heating. In the winter, warm air, descending from above the upstream boundary layer appears to be responsible for the downslope heating. There is little correlation between the upstream wind speed and the upstream-downstream temperature difference. This is explained by weak winds contributing to low level upstream blocking and descent from upper levels in the lee, while strong winds contribute directly to vertical mixing through mechanical turbulence. The annual cycle of temperature difference between the upstream and the downstream slopes indicates that in the summer, solar heating over the downstream slopes is responsible for a substantial part of the heating of the foehn...|$|E

Superheated atomization is used to enhance atomization where conventional pressurized liquid injection cannot achieve the desired fine sprays. Essentially flashing is initiated by in situ bubble nucleation followed by bubble growth. If the internal flow conditions are such that stable cavitation bubbles can form, then such bubbles promote the atomization of the base liquid already in the capillary of the nozzle. Bubble creation via cavitation {{can be achieved by}} changing the nozzle geometry such as the orifice length-to-diameter ratio, the inlet corner radius, the surface conditions of the nozzle material and the flow velocity in the orifice. In case of superheated atomization, the mass flow and thus the flow velocity in the orifice can just be indirectly set by the combination of superheat <b>temperature</b> <b>upstream</b> the nozzle and the difference between high pressure level upstream and ambient pressure downstream the orifice.

40|$|A precise {{estimation}} of the recirculated exhaust gas rate and oxygen concentration {{as well as a}} predictive evaluation of the possible EGR unbalance among cylinders are of paramount importance, especially if non-conventional combustion modes, which require high EGR flow-rates, are implemented. In the present paper, starting from the equation related to convergent nozzles, the EGR mass flow-rate is modeled considering the pressure and the <b>temperature</b> <b>upstream</b> of the EGR control valve, as well as the pressure downstream of it. The restricted flow-area at the valve-seat passage and the discharge coefficient are carefully assessed as functions of the valve lift. Other models were fitted using parameters describing the engine working conditions as inputs, following a semi-physical and a purely statistical approach. The resulting models are then applied to estimate EGR rates to both conventional and non-conventional combustion conditions. In a following step, a correlation was proposed between EGR rate and combustion metrics. This function was then applied to check the possibility of estimating the EGR unbalance, which can negatively affect combustion stability, in particular at high EGR rates. EGR unbalance was also evaluated considering the measurements of the temperature of the charge entering each cylinder. These two methods to evaluate EGR unbalance were then compared to CFD calculations...|$|E

Both shallow and deep types of geothermal energy have the potential to offset carbon emissions, reduce energy costs, and stimulate the economy. Before widespread geothermal exploration and exploitation can occur, both shallow and deep technologies require improvement by theoretical and experimental investigations. This thesis investigated one aspect of both shallow and deep geothermal energy technologies. First, a group of shallow geothermal energy piles was modeled numerically. The model was constructed, calibrated, and validated using available data collected from full-scale in-situ experimental energy piles. Following calibration, the model was parameterized to demonstrate the impact of construction specifications on energy pile performance and cross-sectional thermal stress distribution. The model confirmed the role of evenly spaced heat exchangers in optimal pile performance.

It was found that the air in the park was associated with lower mean (0. 6 °C [1. 1 °F] less) and peak temperatures (1. 1 °C [2. 0 °F] less) compared to residential or shopping streets on either side. The apparent cooling influence of the park extended downstream between 200 and 400 meters (200 to 400 yards). Measurements in four street gorges showed a wide variation in surface temperatures—up to 22 °C (40 °F) —although 5 ºC to 10 °C (9 ºF to 18 °F) was more typical. For a given façade, lighter surfaces were associated with lower temperatures, between 6 ºC and 10 °C (11 ºF and 18 °F) cooler. A strong relationship was found between mean gorge surface temperature and the gorge air temperature measured at 6 m (20 ft) (half-gorge height). This was true for both a sunny day and a cloudy day.

The EGR is often cooled {{in order to}} increase the effectiveness of the strategy, even though this leads to a further undesired impact on particulate matter and hydrocarbons. Experimental tests were carried out on a diesel engine at a dynamometer rig under steady-state speed and load working conditions that were considered relevant for the New European Driving Cycle. Two different shell and tube-type EGR coolers were compared, in terms of the pressure and temperature of the exhaust and intake lines, to evaluate thermal effectiveness and induced pumping losses.

Our objective in this study was to model local and geographic variability in elevations occupied by native and nonnative trout in the northwestern Great Basin, USA. To this end, we analyzed a large existing data set of trout presence (5, 156 observations) to evaluate two fundamental factors influencing occupied elevations: climate-related gradients in geography and local constraints imposed by topography. We applied quantile regression to model upstream and downstream distribution elevation limits for each trout species commonly found in the region (two native and two nonnative species). With these models in hand, we simulated an upstream shift in elevation limits of trout distributions to evaluate potential consequences of habitat loss. Downstream elevation limits were inversely associated with latitude, reflecting regional gradients in <b>temperature.</b> <b>Upstream</b> limits were positively related to maximum stream elevation as expected. Downstream elevation limits were constrained topographically by valley bottom elevations in northern streams but not in southern streams, where limits began well above valley bottoms.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of gaseous fuel solenoid injector for {{spark ignition engine}} has been realized and validated through experimental data. The gas injector was studied with particular reference to the complex needle motion during the opening and closing phases, which strongly affects the amount of fuel injected. As is known, in fact, when the injector nozzle is widely open, the mass flow depends only on the fluid pressure and <b>temperature</b> <b>upstream</b> the injector: this allows one to control the injected fuel mass acting on the “injection time” (the period during which the injector solenoid is energized). This makes {{the correlation between the}} injected fuel mass and the injection time linear, except for the lower injection times, where we experimentally observed strong nonlinearities. These nonlinearities arise by the injector outflow area variation caused by the needle bounces due to impacts during the opening and closing transients [1] and may seriously compromise the mixture quality control, thus increasing both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, above all because the S. I. catalytic conversion system has a very low efficiency for non-stoichiometric mixtures. Moreover, in recent works [2, 3] we tested the simultaneous combustion of a gaseous fuel (compressed natural gas, CNG, or liquefied petroleum gas, LPG) and gasoline in a spark ignition engine obtaining great improvement both in engine efficiency and pollutant emissions with respect to pure gasoline operation mode; this third operating mode of bi-fuel engines, called “double fuel” combustion, requires small amounts of gaseous fuel, hence forcing the injectors to work in the non-monotonic zone of the injected mass diagram, where the control on air-fuel ratio is poor. Starting from these considerations we investigated the fuel injector dynamics with the aim to improve its performance in the low injection times range.

This device combines the increased surface area of a finned geometry with the isothermal heat transfer of a heat pipe and the low speed operation of integrated fan blades to dissipate 1000 W using 30 W of input electrical power in a 10 x 1 Ox 10 cm 3 volume. This thesis focuses on the design and experimental validation of the 2. 5 mm thick, 200 cm 2 surface area flat plate condenser repeated in parallel in the loop heat pipe structure. The condenser was designed to ensure even mass flow distribution and phase-separation within each layer. To better understand the physics and governing parameters within the thin geometry of the condenser, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated that allowed for visualization and measurement of the condensing flow. Experimental studies were conducted to explore condensation within open and sinter channel geometries while varying flow rate, backside cooling, and gravitational orientation. Open channel flow exhibited sensitivity to cooling heat transfer and orientation resulting in a variable condensing length connected to {{a sharp drop in}} surface temperature and gravity-dominated flow patterns. In contrast, testing with sinter wick in the channel demonstrated an isothermal surface over the length of the condenser and gravitationally independent flow stability due to separation of the liquid and vapor phases. The addition of a sub-cooling length within the sinter channel was shown to retain high isothermal <b>temperatures</b> <b>upstream</b> while reducing condensate temperature below saturation before the condenser outlet. However, to prevent large pressure drops incurred by flow through the sinter, balance is required between desired sub-cooling and sinter permeability. This work demonstrates the potential for a condenser design with a sintered wick and a sub-cooling section to mitigate the failure modes of parallel condensers. These results serve as guidelines for the continued development of the parallel plate condensers for the loop heat pipe integrated into the compact heat exchanger. by Catherine Helene Koveal.
