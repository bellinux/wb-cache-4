40|$|Objectives : The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} effect of Exercise on inhibition Blood pressure by Auricular-plaster Vaccaria seeds Methods : This study picked 40 peoples from 20 May 2009 to 30 June 2009 and experiment them. Attached Vaccaria seeds to auricular acupuncture of the experiment group. Did not attach them to the control group. Them to exercise using a Bike-Ergometer exercise. I measured their blood pressure before <b>the</b> <b>exercise,</b> 15 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> and 30 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise.</b> I compared <b>the</b> difference between the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The method to choose the subjects was Random allocation. Results : 1. Comparing the systolic blood pressure of the experiment group and the control group, the average systolic blood pressure of the experiment group, who did <b>the</b> Bike-Ergometer <b>exercise</b> putting on Auricular-plaster Vaccaria seeds, was 125. 45 mmHg before <b>the</b> <b>exercise,</b> 121. 20 mmHg 15 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> and 120. 30 mmHg 30 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> group’s systolic blood pressure after <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> was more controlled than the systolic blood pressure before <b>the</b> <b>exercise.</b> <b>The</b> control group’s systolic blood pressure increased compared to the beginning. To measure the change before and after <b>the</b> <b>exercise,</b> I carried out paird-t test. The result was statistically significant. 2. Comparing the diastolic blood pressure of the experiment group and the control group, the average diastolic blood pressure of the experiment group, who did <b>the</b> Bike-Ergometer <b>exercise</b> putting on Auricular-plaster Vaccaria seeds, was 81. 45 mmHg before <b>the</b> <b>exercise,</b> 79. 65 mmHg 15 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> and 79. 05 mmHg 30 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise.</b> As a result of carrying out paird-t test to measure the change of the diastolic blood pressure, the change of the dilating blood pressure was statistically significant. However, the difference of the dilating blood pressure between 15 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> and 30 minutes after <b>the</b> <b>exercise</b> was not statistically significant. Comparing the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure of the experiment group and the control group, the blood pressure of the experiment group, who did <b>the</b> Bike-Ergometer <b>exercise</b> putting on Auricular-plaster Vaccaria seeds, decreased compared to the beginning and the blood pressure of the control group, who did not put on Auricular-plaster Vaccaria seeds, increased compared to the beginning. Conclusions : The hypothesis was supported that the increase of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the experiment group, putting on Auricular-plaster Vaccaria seeds, was more controlled than that of the control group. In future, it can be medically used by verifying the various effects through repeated studies...|$|R

In December 1911, Lepanto and Italia were sent to Tripoli, replacing the three s, to support the Italian garrison that had captured the city. The two Italias were sent in large part because the Italian Navy had a large stockpile of 17-inch shells. Lepanto was stricken on 26 May 1912, but was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as a first-class auxiliary ship.
