5|$|The core {{gameplay}} of the Guitar Hero {{games is}} a rhythm game similar to Konami's Guitar Freaks {{and to a}} lesser extent Harmonix's previous music games such as Frequency and Amplitude. The guitar controller is recommended for play, although a standard console controller can be used instead. However, the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series. The game supports <b>toggling</b> the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the chemists {{considered}} {{the problem of}} how plutonium could be separated from uranium when its chemical properties were not known. Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a lanthanum fluoride process for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the bismuth phosphate process, was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson. This process worked by <b>toggling</b> plutonium between its +4 and +6 oxidation states in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, Saber Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached Saber Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary. After considering whether to remake the game entirely or to adapt and add features to the existing PC version, Saber decided to use its game engine for reproducing the original's appearance and the original Halos engine for gameplay. A development tool for <b>toggling</b> between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service, new and remastered sound effects and music, and extras such as achievements and hidden in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E

25|$|The Late Period, {{dated to}} about 2500 BC, the pithouse (quiggly hole) came into existence, {{such as those}} at the Keatley Creek Archaeological Site. Other markers of this period include the {{increasing}} number of pithouses and settlements. Fishing continued to increase, and technology advanced, introducing more specialized barb fish spears and composite <b>toggling</b> harpoons. Other technology was used as well, including nets and weirs. Trade networks also flourished during this time, using sea shells, turquoise, fish grease and others.|$|E
25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops <b>toggling</b> the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between New Bedford and Nantucket allowed {{the two cities}} to dominate the whaling industry. In 1848 New Bedford resident Lewis Temple invented the <b>toggling</b> harpoon, an invention that would revolutionize the whaling industry. This helped make New Bedford the preeminent city in the U.S. whaling industry. Another factor was the increased draft of whaling ships, in part the result of greater use of steel in their construction, which made them too deep for Nantucket harbor. Syren, the longest lived of the clipper ships, spent over a decade transporting whale oil and whaling products to New Bedford, principally from Honolulu, and was owned for several years by William H. Besse of New Bedford. As {{a result of its}} control over whaling products that were used widely throughout the world (most importantly whale oil), New Bedford became one of the richest per capita cities in the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} criticised for some {{negative}} issues, {{such as the}} aiming system in gunplay. The developer had initially countered complaints that the game's aiming was inaccurate in a blog post on its official site. However, after complaints continued on the Naughty Dog forum and NeoGAF, a patch to address concerns about the game's aiming system was impending after developer Naughty Dog invited a couple of fans to its HQ to discuss the problem. On November 27, 2011, Naughty Dog released a patch that offered a fix for those unhappy with the game's refined aiming controls. The update offers the option of <b>toggling</b> between the new controls and a set-up {{more in line with}} that found in Uncharted 2. Despite being addressed in the previous games in the series, another minor issue raised was that of the game's linearity. Amy Hennig, in an interview with GameTrailers, defended this aspect by arguing that too little linearity in the series would have affected the game's narrative.|$|E
25|$|Grudge Warriors {{places the}} player {{in control of}} one of eleven special armored cars. Each one is {{equipped}} with five types of weaponry. Four of the weapons are similar on all the cars; the fifth weapon is unique to the vehicle. In single-player, the objective for each mission is to destroy enemy tanks, gun emplacements, vehicles, and generators; there are always eight at each base which must be destroyed. In addition, players can collect tokens as an optional objective; these tokens allow for upgrades and boost the player's score. Some generators can only be reached by solving puzzles; for example, <b>toggling</b> switches which lower otherwise-impenetrable shields surrounding a generator. Every player vehicle features both armor and health; powerups which replenish both can be found scattered throughout the maps. In addition, the player has only a finite amount of ammunition for each weapon. When the player's health is reduced to zero, the game is over and the mission must be restarted.|$|E
50|$|Feature <b>toggles</b> are {{essentially}} variables {{that are used}} inside conditional statements. Therefore, the blocks inside these conditional statements can be <b>toggled</b> 'on or off' depending {{on the value of}} the feature <b>toggles.</b> A block of code which has been <b>toggled</b> 'off' is similar to it being commented out. This allows developers to control the flow of their software and bypass features that are not ready for deployment.|$|R

500|$|To {{increase}} the interactivity with the game-world, id Software designed hundreds of high-resolution animated screens for in-game computers. Rather than using a simple [...] "use key" [...] to operate these computers, the crosshair {{acts as a}} mouse cursor over the screens allowing the player to use a computer in the game world. This allows for in-game computer terminal to perform more than one function, from operating security door codes, activating machinery, <b>toggling</b> lights or unlocking weapons lockers. According to the Doom 3 manual, GUI designer Patrick Duffy wrote over 500,000 lines of script code, and generated more than 25,000 image files to create all of the graphical interfaces, computer screens, and displays throughout Doom 3. Other important features of the game engine are normal mapping and specular highlighting of textures, realistic handling of object physics, dynamic, ambient soundtrack, and multi-channel sound. Doom 3 on Xbox supports 480p widescreen video display resolution and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{commenced}} on {{the pilot}} separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. Not until May 1943 would DuPont managers decide {{to use the}} bismuth phosphate process in preference to one using lanthanum fluoride. The bismuth phosphate process was devised by [...] Stanley G. Thompson at the University of California. Plutonium had two oxidation states; a tetravalent (+4) state, and hexavalent (+6) state, with [...] different chemical properties. Bismuth phosphate (...) was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate, and plutonium would be carried with bismuth phosphate in a solution while other elements, including uranium, would be precipitated. The plutonium could be switched from being in solution to being precipitated by <b>toggling</b> its oxidation state. The plant consisted of six cells, separated {{from each other and}} the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated from the control room by remote control due to the radioactivity produced by fission products. Work was completed on 26 November 1943, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to other music and rhythm video games, in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song. The basic mechanics are based on Konami's Guitar Freaks. In the case of Guitar Hero, the player may use either the guitar peripheral (a 3/4-scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as bundled with the game, or a third-party version) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes. The guitar peripheral has five different-colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck, and a strum bar and a whammy bar {{on the body of}} the guitar. The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game's menus. Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes, matching in color and position to the fret buttons, that scroll down the screen on a fret board. To hit or play a note, the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar {{at the same time as}} that note passes a marked area on the screen. Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer-on and pull-off techniques where the player does not need to strum each note. [...] The game supports <b>toggling</b> the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller. A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game's manual.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} concerts for {{the duration}} of the tour were also met with high praise from critics: [...] Merecedes J.

[...] Howze concluded that the show was definitely a [...] "couples concert" [...] meant to be [...] "enjoy" [...] with a love partner. CityBeats Jac Kern, who attended the same show praised the duo for performing hard while fully using both of the two stages and interacting with the crowd. However he also felt that intimate moments between the couple on stage were [...] "possibly staged". The production of the tour was stated to be both large and minimal by The Boston Globe writer James Read who commented that only a few performers could manage to pull off a production of On The Run's scale. He continued his review, [...] "Nor is there much to behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a visible band. With Beyoncé and Jay-Z, two natural-born entertainers, you do not need much more." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press reported that the set list of the show emulated a conversation told through songs; he noted that despite the concert being a collaborative tour, [...] "it was the performers' emotional solo material that made their presence as a collaborative duo strong and resilient". The first Canadian show of the tour was again well received by critics. Graham Slaughter of the Toronto Star concluded in his review, [...] "If there's anything to be learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised." [...] Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times who attended the first of two shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses [...] "balancing out each other's weaknesses with individual strengths" [...] on stage. Ali went on praising the stage interactions between the pair such as kissing and <b>toggling</b> and concluded, [...] "Whether it was a carefully orchestrated act or not, they are a great team." ...|$|E
