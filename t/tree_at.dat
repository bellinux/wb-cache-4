40|$|Street {{trees are}} {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in making fine townscape in the Master Plan for Townscape in Muroran City. This study investigated street <b>trees</b> <b>at</b> 16 main arterial roads and made their characteristics clear. Natural landscape in Muroran is quite nice but townscape, especially in built-up area, is relatively poor. One row of street <b>trees</b> <b>at</b> both pedestrian ways is not so enough that combination of street trees and other elements is important. Others mean <b>trees</b> <b>at</b> roadside building sites or parks, hedge or flowers at residential zone and street furnitures or street lights at commercial zone...|$|R

5|$|On June 18, 1998, {{a severe}} storm damaged the estate. Heavy rains caused the {{drainage}} system to fail and {{a cascade of}} water surged over the retaining wall.

The next year, another storm collapsed a tunnel underneath the studio wing. A 1999 grant from Save America's Treasures helped defray costs to re-roof Taliesin III, to stabilize its foundation, and to connect it to a local sewage treatment plant.|$|E
