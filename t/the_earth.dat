5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> {{and it is}} this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> experiences is less than 1% of the force that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> feels daily from the Moon.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> moves around the Sun.

5000|$|It is {{convenient}} {{to define the}} orientation of an ECI frame using <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> orbit plane and the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> rotational axis in space.

50|$|Many {{factors can}} affect the {{appearance}} of the Moon during a lunar eclipse.

While <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> shadow blocks any direct light from striking the Moon during a lunar eclipse, some light is refracted through <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> atmosphere giving a Moon a red hue.|$|R

5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> rotates on its axis.

5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Earth</b> is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Earth</b> continues to receive at least 92 percent of the amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> Seen from the Moon, <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
