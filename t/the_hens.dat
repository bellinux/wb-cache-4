5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a {{farmyard}} which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants to hatch her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{success is}} {{dependent}} {{on a variety of}} factors that range from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the-rock displayed sexual selection based off sequential comparisons or threshold standards. <b>The</b> <b>hens</b> engaged in a “pool–comparison” tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males. The females in the study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger, more centrally concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice.|$|E

5000|$|To {{initiate}} courting, some roosters may {{dance in}} a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering his wing which is closest to <b>the</b> <b>hen.</b> [...] <b>The</b> dance triggers a response in <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> and when she responds to his [...] "call", the rooster may mount <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> and proceed with the mating.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hens</b> – <b>The</b> <b>hens</b> are promised at {{the start}} of the {{revolution}} that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr Jones. However their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. <b>The</b> <b>hens</b> are among the first to rebel against Napoleon.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{conditions}} are often automatically controlled in egg-laying systems. For example, {{the duration of}} the light phase is initially increased to prompt the beginning of egg-laying at 16–20 weeks of age and then mimics summer day length which stimulates <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> to continue laying eggs all year round; normally, egg production occurs only in the warmer months. Some commercial breeds of hen can produce over 300 eggs a year.|$|E
25|$|It nests on the ground, near {{water and}} under cover. The pairs {{form in the}} winter {{quarters}} and arrive on the breeding grounds together, starting about March. The breeding starts some weeks thereafter, not until May in the most northernly locations. The nest is a deep hollow lined with dry leaves and down feathers, built in dense vegetation near water. After the females have started laying, the males leave them and move away for shorter or longer distances, assembling in flocks on particular lakes where they moult into eclipse plumage; they will usually encounter their offspring only in winter quarters. The clutch may consist of 5–16 eggs, but usually numbers 8–11; they are incubated for 21–23 days. The young leave the nest soon after hatching and are attended by the mother for about 25–30 days, after which they fledge. The drakes and <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> with young generally move to the winter quarters separately. After the first winter, the young moult into adult plumage. The maximum recorded lifespan – {{though it is not}} clear whether this refers to the common or the green-winged teal—was over 27 years, which is rather high for such a small bird.|$|E
50|$|While the old {{couple was}} talking, <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> accidentally {{heard all the}} {{conversation}} they talked to each other. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> was so depressed, however {{she did not think}} to escape {{and went back to the}} stable to see her children. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> told everything she heard from the old couple to seven chicks then they held each other and cried a lot. The little chicks told her mother to leave this place together but she refused. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> said <b>the</b> old couple took good care of her since she was a tiny chick and now it was time to repay them. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> said goodbye to the seven chicks. She held them closely and spent time with them for the last night.|$|R
50|$|The hawk will 'buy' {{a chicken}} from <b>the</b> <b>hen.</b> <b>The</b> hawk will {{then take the}} chicken, asks him/her to hunt for food and goes to sleep. While the hawk is asleep, the chicken will return to <b>the</b> <b>hen.</b> <b>The</b> Hawk wakes up and tries to get back the chicken he bought while <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> and other {{chickens}} prevent the hawk from catching the chicken. If the hawk succeeds, the chicken is taken and punished. If the hawk fails to catch the chicken, the hawk will try to buy the chicken.|$|R
50|$|Oswald and {{the doll}} reach {{a room where}} <b>the</b> special <b>hen</b> is located. When the doll asks for an egg, <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> is {{considerate}} to lay one. But when Oswald himself asks, <b>the</b> <b>hen,</b> for some reason, refuses. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> goes to make some noise which wakes up a giant bull. And when the bull pursues them, Oswald and the doll {{have no choice but}} to leave. After exiting the castle, they climb down the stalk. The giant bull follows them in the same way.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "farmyard tale" [...] was {{dedicated}} to Betsy and Ralph Cannon, the children of Potter's farm manager, John Cannon. The children appear {{in one of the}} illustrations collecting Jemima's eggs from the rhubarb patch, and their mother is depicted in the opening picture feeding the barnyard fowl. Jemima was based upon a real world duck at Hill Top Farm who evaded Mrs. Cannon and her children in their attempts to locate her eggs before she mismanaged their incubation. Mrs. Cannon believed ducks made poor sitters, and routinely confiscated the ducks' eggs to allow <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> to incubate them. Potter may have taken inspiration from a drawing in her father's 1853 sketchbook of a flying duck wearing a bonnet. Potter almost certainly chose the name [...] "Jemima" [...] in honour of Jemima Blackburn, an ornithological painter and illustrator whose Birds from Nature she had received as a gift on her tenth birthday and whom she met in 1891.|$|E
500|$|In 1901 {{the farm}} had 1,045 Jersey cattle, 4,000 {{chickens}} and ducks, 1,500 pigs, and 400 sheep. It grew, with 500 workers tending those animals {{in addition to}} Thoroughbred horses, pheasants and peacocks. The pigs (which included Chester Whites and Berkshires) lived outdoors, because the farm superintendent believed they should be penned only for breeding; in summer, {{they were allowed to}} run in the orchards or the woods. About 2,000 were butchered each year. The farm's 31 poultry houses had a head poulterer and 40 assistants; each building was , and they were spread around the property. The farm, which used 300-egg insulators, fed <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> a mix of grains (including oats, wheat and corn) five times a day. The farm butchered 7,000 broilers each season. Eggs sold for 35 to 50 cents per dozen, with demand exceeding supply. Broilers sold for $1.50 ($ in [...] ) to $3.00 ($ in [...] ) per pair. Briarcliff Farms raised about 300 lambs each spring, primarily Dorset Horns. The lambs, which were dressed (their internal organs removed) on the farm, sold for $12 ($ in [...] ) or more apiece; demand also exceeded supply.|$|E
2500|$|For example, in {{the case}} of mumps and measles viruses, the virus strains were grown in embryonated hens' eggs and chick embryo cell cultures. [...] This {{produced}} strains of virus which were adapted for <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> egg and less well-suited for human cells. [...] These strains are therefore called attenuated strains. [...] They are sometimes referred to as neuroattenuated because these strains are less virulent to human neurons than the wild strains.|$|E

50|$|This episode {{starts with}} Jerry {{trying to get}} a piece of cheese from a {{mousetrap}} in a barn. Tom comes out of his hiding place to watch Jerry and hears the trap go off. He chases after Jerry who has his tail caught in the trap while holding the cheese. Jerry stops and hands Tom the cheese. Jerry then releases his tail, grabs the cheese back, and runs away. Jerry tries to cut Tom's neck with a pair of shears but fails. Tom then chases Jerry near a chicken sitting on her nest. Jerry hides underneath <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> and Tom startles her when he reaches underneath her to grab Jerry. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> responds by pecking Tom's head, scaring him away. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> sits back down and Jerry emerges eating his cheese. Jerry leaves the barn but gets chased back into it by Tom. He runs underneath <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> again, and <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> wakes up before Tom can even try to reach Jerry and she pecks him away again. Jerry then realizes how warm it is underneath <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> and he has to use one of the hen's feathers as a fan. Meanwhile, Tom has returned and he quietly tries to reach Jerry, but ends up stepping into the hen's food bowl and runs away. He briefly disguises himself as a milkmaid while milking the cow and then tries again. As he reaches underneath <b>the</b> <b>hen,</b> he grabs one of the hen's eggs instead of Jerry, which results in <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> clucking at Tom in a mean way. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> arranges <b>the</b> eggs with a nearby triangle in the same manner as arranging billiard balls. Later, Tom sets up a mousetrap tied to a string and puts it underneath <b>the</b> <b>hen.</b> Jerry comes out with the trap and he sets the trap with Tom's tail on it. Tom doesn't find out that his tail is in the trap for a while and then screams out in pain.|$|R

2500|$|Modern {{egg laying}} breeds often suffer from {{osteoporosis}} {{which results in}} the chicken's skeletal system being weakened. During egg production, large amounts of calcium are transferred from bones to create egg-shell. Although dietary calcium levels are adequate, absorption of dietary calcium is not always sufficient, given the intensity of production, to fully replenish bone calcium. [...] This can lead to increases in bone breakages, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> are being removed from cages {{at the end of}} laying.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dominant}} commercial breed is the Broad-breasted Whites (similar to [...] "White Holland", but {{a separate}} breed), {{which have been}} selected for size and amount of meat. Mature toms are too large to achieve natural fertilization without injuring <b>the</b> <b>hens,</b> so their semen is collected, and hens are inseminated artificially. Several hens can be inseminated from each collection, so fewer toms are needed. The eggs of some turkey breeds are able to develop without fertilization, in a process called parthenogenesis. [...] Breeders' meat is too tough for roasting, and is mostly used to make processed meats.|$|E
2500|$|While often {{confused}} with free-range farming, yarding {{is actually a}} separate method of poultry culture by which chickens and cows are raised together. The distinction is that free-range poultry are either totally unfenced, or the fence is so distant that it has little influence on their freedom of movement. Yarding is common technique used by small farms in the Northeastern US. [...] The birds are released daily from hutches or coops. [...] <b>The</b> <b>hens</b> usually lay eggs either {{on the floor of}} the coop or in baskets if provided by the farmer. This husbandry technique can be complicated if used with roosters, mostly because of aggressive behavior.|$|E

2500|$|In farms using cages for egg production, {{there are}} more birds per unit area; this allows for greater {{productivity}} and lower food costs. [...] Floor space ranges upwards from 300cm2 per hen. EU standards in 2003 called for at least 550cm2 per hen. In the US, the current recommendation by the United Egg Producers is 67 to 86 in2 (430 to 560cm2) per bird. The space available to battery hens has often been described as less than {{the size of a}} piece of A4 paper. Animal welfare scientists have been critical of battery cages because they do not provide hens with sufficient space to stand, walk, flap their wings, perch, or make a nest, and it is widely considered that hens suffer through boredom and frustration through being unable to perform these behaviours. [...] This can lead {{to a wide range of}} abnormal behaviours, some of which are injurious to <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> or their cagemates.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned {{conventional}} battery cages for {{laying hens}} throughout the European Union from January 1, 2012; they were banned previously {{in other countries}} including Switzerland. In response to these bans, development of prototype commercial furnished cage systems began in the 1980s. [...] Furnished cages, sometimes called 'enriched' or 'modified' cages, are cages for egg laying hens which {{have been designed to}} overcome some of the welfare concerns of battery cages whilst retaining their economic and husbandry advantages, and also provide some of the welfare advantages of non-cage systems. Many design features of furnished cages have been incorporated because research in animal welfare science has shown them to be of benefit to <b>the</b> <b>hens.</b> In the UK, the Defra [...] "Code for the Welfare of Laying Hens" [...] states furnished cages should provide at least 750cm2 of cage area per hen, 600cm2 of which should be usable; the height of the cage other than that above the usable area should be at least 20cm at every point and no cage should have a total area that is less than 2000cm2. In addition, furnished cages should provide a nest, litter such that pecking and scratching are possible, appropriate perches allowing at least 15cm per hen, a claw-shortening device, and a feed trough which may be used without restriction providing 12cm per hen.|$|E

50|$|Later, the cat sneaks {{into the}} barn inside a butter churner. He pokes the chicken with a fork and {{searches}} the nest for Jerry.

This continues until <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> sees <b>the</b> fork and removes the churner, grabs the fork and ends up poking Tom with <b>the</b> fork. <b>The</b> <b>hen</b> starts to ride on Tom like a horse, but suddenly stops when she hears chirps from her nest.

40|$|While {{the number}} of marriages taking place in Britain {{continues}} to decline, <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> party has become both an accepted marriage ritual {{and a source of}} controversy. In previous research we have found bar owners and town centre managers eager to discourage hen parties from their town centres and venues. Equally, in the popular press, <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> party is increasingly portrayed in comparable terms to the 'stag do'; a night of drunken excess and embarrassing misdemeanours. This paper examines <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> party in terms of the articulation of gender, alcohol and public space. Through a wide-ranging literature survey and pilot interviews, we ask if <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> party exaggerates existing behaviours and practices, or whether it represents an entirely new, albeit limited, example of how women are using public space at night. Against the backdrop of a historical anxiety about women and public space, and growing concern about women and binge drinking, we examine <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> party as both a site of transgression, empowerment and female bonding, and as a unique opportunity to explore women's shifting attitudes to late-night culture...|$|R
