40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to the verification of functional-logic programs. For our verification purposes, equational reasoning is not valid due {{to the presence of}} non-deterministic and partial functions. Our approach transforms functionallogic programs into Maude theories and then uses the Rewriting Logic logical framework to verify properties of the transformed programs. We propose an inductive proving method based on the length of the computation on the Rewriting Logic framework to cope with the non-deterministic and non-terminating aspects of the programs. We illustrate the application of the method on various examples, where we analyze the sequence of steps to be performed by the proof in order to get expertise for the automatization of the process. Then, since the proposed transformation process is also amenable of automatization, we will obtain a tool for proving properties of CRWL programs. Another advantage of our methodology, that distinguish it from other approaches, {{is that it does not}} confuse the original functional-logic program with the subjects we want to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> properties, but it allows the equational definition of observations on top of the transformed programs which simplifies the obtained proofs...|$|E

The situation becomes even more interesting when one similarly considers Q n sitting in R n; {{this has been the}} area of several exciting recent developments, which we may <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second part of the course. The introductory part will feature: rate of approximation of real numbers by rationals; theorems of Kronecker, Dirichlet, Liouville, Borel-Cantelli; connections with dynamical systems: circle rotations, hyperbolic flow in the space of lattices, geodesic flow on the modular survace, Gauss map (continued fractions); ergodicity, unique ergodicity, mixing, applications to uniform distribution of sequences (e. g. fractional parts of polynomials), Khintchine’s Theorem and the method of regular systems. Other topics could be (choice based upon the preferences of the audience) : • Hausdorff measures and dimension, examples of fractal sets and measures they support • W. Schmidt’s (α, β) -games, winning sets, badly approximable numbers • ubiquitious systems, very well approximable numbers, Jarnik-Besicovitch Theore...|$|E

30|$|Third, when {{it comes}} to online {{community}} building, several scholars collectively pointed to the importance of a clearly defined focus and purpose (e.g., Salmon, 2000). In our study, we encouraged the students to have casual and free talk on any topic that interested them. Nevertheless, they felt at a loss as to what they should talk about or discuss. Another factor concerns social relationship and leadership that are also important for fostering and sustaining online activities (e.g., Cho, Gay, Davidson, & Ingraffea, 2007). In line with other studies (e.g., Gray, Annabell, & Kennedy, 2010; Thompson, 2007), our students {{did not know what to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Facebook group due to the lack of existing social bond or relationships. When the students were faced with unfamiliar people and were left on their own to find a topic for discussion, they felt perplexed. What can we do to address these problems then? We will consider letting the students take the full ownership and responsibility of the informal group on Facebook. One or two active students from Hong Kong and Taiwan will be identified to serve as student leaders. These leaders will take the responsibility of initiating and facilitating social conversation in the online group. In this way, students might feel more comfortable having casual and social chitchat in an online group they could claim their own.|$|E
40|$|Sally Swartz’s impassioned {{and poetic}} {{rendering}} of the possibilities of psycho-therapy case-note writing as a forum in which to reflect and generate new interpretations on her therapeutic encounters inspired in {{me a sense of}} simulta-neous exhilaration and envy. Her juxtaposition of Ogden’s (1994) notion of the ‘analytic third ’ and other intersubjective psychoanalytic theorists (Stolorow and Atwood, 1992) alongside feminist, postcolonial and dialogical theorists, applying these to her work as a white African woman therapist with black and white clients (men and women), does indeed indicate something of the radical potential of such resources. The extracts from her therapy notes convey something of the struggle {{to find a way to}} forge communication across complex and interweaving power relationships that – in a therapy situation, as all others perhaps – are both struc-tural and personal, and shift from moment to moment with particular effects and affects. As both (group) therapist and academic, I ache to see such work happen here in the postcolonial ‘centre’. For it speaks of real engagement and commitment to use therapy as an arena to explore the impacts and insults of racism, sexism and heterosexism in all their meticulous, gross and microscopic inscriptions on our bodies and minds. I know such work happens here (and I have tried to contribute to some of this – cf. Aitken and Burman, 1999; Gowrisunkur et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2002) – but it is becoming increasingly difficult to write and <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> name of protecting the public and transparency, and in a climate where professions are both required to regulate their own practice and are increasingly subject to state scrutiny, psychotherapists in the UK are being recommended by their training organizations to keep as few notes as possible, and certainly not to own up to writing extensive notes.

40|$|Mental {{health is}} a major child public health issue in Sweden. The overall aims of this thesis are to explore girls’ and boys’ {{perspectives}} on mental health and on mental health-promoting initiatives, and to deepen the knowledge of disclosure and support for ado-lescents at risk of abuse and neglect. Four studies {{are included in the}} thesis, and a qualitative descriptive design was chosen. In three of the studies (Studies I, II, and III), adolescents in Sweden were interviewed individually or in focus-groups. In the fourth study (IV) officials and politicians in nine municipalities in Sweden were interviewed, and documents were analysed in a multiple-case-study design. In study I the adolescents were asked about the mental health-promoting dialogue with the school nurse. The results reveal that what the adolescents found important were trustiness, attentiveness, respectfulness, authenticity, accessibility, and continuity. The adolescents also had certain views on what issues to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> health dialogue; physical and psychological issues should be included. In Study II, the adolescents perceived “mental health” to be an emotional experience with positive and negative aspects of internal and relational feelings. Family, friends, and school were regarded as important determinants of mental health by the adolescents. Neither girls nor boys thought that there were any major differences in mental health between girls and boys, but did think they were subject to different expectations. In Study III the results show that adolescents with families with alcohol problems are unsure whether to disclose their home situation to an adult; the adolescents seem to make a risk assessment when looking for trustworthy adults. It is a disclosure process. Friends are confidants and supportive, and sometimes facilitators for contacting adults, when support from adults is needed. Study IV show that even small grants to municipalities for children-at-risk projects lead to more activities for these children and adolescents. But children or adolescents were not involved in the planning or decision-making of the activities. The studies in this thesis show that most important thing for adolescents’ mental health is the relation between adolescents and adults, foremost parents, and between adolescents and friends. In addition, gender and age, adolescents’ perspec¬tives and par-ticipation, and society’s support, including the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, have an impact on adolescents’ mental health, both for ado-lescents in general and for adolescents at risk of abuse and neglect. The results are viewed in relation to the bioecological model, to illustrate how all levels in society influence mental health among adolescents, on an individual and a population plane. The findings have implications for adults: to learn more about adolescents and puberty, and about the home situation for children and adolescents at risk of abuse and neglect; to listen to suggestions from children and adolescents; to include friends in support to adolescents at risk of abuse and neglect; and to include girls and boys in all matters concerning them...|$|E
