40|$|The claims {{data of the}} Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) is an {{important}} source of in-formation for healthcare service research. The claims data of HIRA is collected when healthcare service pro-viders submit a claim to HIRA to be reimbursed for a service that they provided to patients. To improve the accessibility of healthcare service researchers to claims data of HIRA, HIRA has developed the Patient Sam-ples which are extracted using a stratified randomized sampling method. The Patient Samples of HIRA consist of five tables: a <b>table</b> <b>for</b> general information (<b>Table</b> 20) containing socio-demographic information such as gen-der, age and medical aid, indicators for inpatient and outpatient services; a <b>table</b> <b>for</b> specific information on health-care services provided (Table 30); a <b>table</b> <b>for</b> diagnostic information (<b>Table</b> 40); a <b>table</b> <b>for</b> outpatient prescrip-tions (<b>Table</b> 53) and a <b>table</b> <b>for</b> information on healthcare service providers (Table of providers).

5|$|Repetitive group {{selection}} <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> repetitive dives were modified. The first repetitive dive {{uses the}} same repetitive group selection as the U.S. Navy tables but subsequent dives use more conservative tables which place the diver in a higher repetitive group than the Navy tables would for the same profile. This tendency is continued for {{the third and fourth}} repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> {{professional}} diving use is generally {{made by the}} organization employing the divers.

5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of the {{activity}} of a hurricane season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these <b>tables.</b> <b>For</b> all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E

5|$|During the {{development}} of these algorithms and tables, it was recognized that a successful algorithm could be used to replace the existing collection of incompatible <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> various air and Nitrox diving modes currently in the U.S. Navy Diving Manual with a set of mutually compatible decompression tables based on a single model, which was proposed by Gerth and Doolette in 2007. This has been done in Revision 6 of the US Navy Diving Manual published in 2008, though some changes were made.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} where the diver is {{successfully}} recompressed within the nominal interval, he will be decompressed according to the schedule in the air decompression <b>tables</b> <b>for</b> surface decompression, preferably on oxygen, which is used from 50fsw (15msw), a partial pressure of 2.5 bar. The duration of the 50fsw stop is 15 minutes for the Revision 6 tables. The chamber is then decompressed to 40fsw (12msw) for {{the next stage of}} up to 4 periods on oxygen. A stop may also be done at 30fsw (9msw), for further periods on oxygen according to the schedule. Air breaks of 5 minutes are taken {{at the end of each}} 30 minutes of oxygen breathing.|$|E
