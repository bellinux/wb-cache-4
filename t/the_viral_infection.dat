5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical {{reports from the}} period of the pandemic, found that <b>the</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> itself was not more aggressive than any previous influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> {{that causes}} croup leads to {{swelling}} of the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils).

5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). <b>The</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD may pose a high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E

Balmung accuses Kite of causing <b>the</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> spreading through the game, and leaves. Kite and BlackRose decide to cooperate to help the coma victims. After investigating a number of leads, Kite and BlackRose track down Skeith, the creature that put Orca into a coma.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{immunomodulatory}} agents, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), {{have been}} effectively utilized {{in the management}} of several malignancies, in transplant rejection, in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and in a range of further indications.
