5|$|Madonna: An Intimate Biography {{is a book}} by American author J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{chronicling the}} life of American singer Madonna. The book was {{released}} in April 2001 by Sidgwick & Jackson in the United Kingdom, and in August 2001 by Simon & Schuster in the United States. Taraborrelli first considered writing <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> 1990, but, realizing the project might be premature in respect to Madonna's fledgling career, set it aside. He began writing <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> 1996, when Madonna {{gave birth to her}} daughter Lourdes.|$|E

5|$|Burger's Daughter is a {{political}} and historical novel by the South African Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Nadine Gordimer, first published in the United Kingdom in June 1979 by Jonathan Cape. The book {{was expected to be}} banned in South Africa, and a month after publication in London the import and sale of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> South Africa was prohibited by the Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the banning and the restrictions were lifted.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first two parts of <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> <b>In</b> that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due {{to a number of}} factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|Faramir {{appears in}} several {{illustrations}} created by John Howe, Ted Nasmith and Anke Eißmann for The Lord of the Rings and related products. One {{of the scenes}} from the book that received many depictions is Faramir and Éowyn's meeting {{at the top of}} Minas Tirith. Eißmann apparently follows <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> presenting Faramir as dark-haired and beardless, also emphasising his recent recovery in the illustration for the dialogue with Éowyn; Nasmith depicts Faramir as bearded and brown-haired.|$|E

5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, {{suggesting that}} it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E

5|$|Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin– A well-off {{lawyer who}} is engaged to Raskolnikov's sister Dunya in the {{beginning}} of the novel.

Luzhin represents immorality throughout <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to Svidrigaïlov's amorality, and Raskolnikov's misguided morality.|$|E

Al-Jabri wrote a book {{covering}} {{the history of the}} movement and its justification in the hadith, essentially designed to glorify the Mahdi and his son. Abd al-Rahman tried to publish <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>in</b> 1925–26, but the British confiscated the manuscript, which they considered to be highly seditious. To avoid publicity, they did not prosecute al-Jabri but quietly deported him.|$|E
