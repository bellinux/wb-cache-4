5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to crop rotation. The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> between Poland and the Black Sea ports.

During the Golden Age of Athens the Long Walls were constructed to connect Athens with Piraeus. Consequently, it became the chief harbour of ancient Greece, but declined gradually after the 4th century AD, growing once more in the 19th century, especially after Athens' declaration as the capital of Greece.

The CAM was set up on 1 October 1983 at Beiteddine, headed by an eight-man supreme council that included a central committee and a general congress. Its own 23 bureaus staffed by 3,000 public employees provided everything from education to medical care and also employed 2,000 seasonal workers in agricultural and industrial projects in the Chouf. To finance the administration, the PLA levied tolls on the <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> of agricultural products and other goods at a number of in-land road checkpoints and at the illegal ports of Khalde and Jiyeh in the Iqlim al-Kharrub coastal enclave – where additional revenues where generated by a network of PSP-run Hotels and Casinos –, whilst the expatriated Druze community in the United States provided financial support.|$|E

2500|$|Karzai's {{relations}} with neighboring Pakistan are good, {{especially with the}} Awami National Party (ANP) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). He often describes his nation and Pakistan as [...] "inseparable twin brothers", {{a reference to the}} disputed Durand Line border between the two states. In December 2007, Karzai and his delegates travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, for a usual meeting with Pervez Musharraf on trade ties and intelligence sharing between the two Islamic states. Karzai also met and had a 45-minute talk with Benazir Bhutto on the morning of 27 December, hours before her trip to Liaquat National Bagh, where she was assassinated after her speech. After Bhutto's death, Karzai called her his sister and a brave woman who had a clear vision [...] "for her own country, for Afghanistan, and for the region– a vision of democracy, prosperity, and peace." [...] In September 2008, Karzai was invited on a special visit to witness the swearing-in ceremony of Asif Ali Zardari, who became the President of Pakistan. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have improved after the PPP party took over in 2008. The two nations often make contacts with one another concerning the war on terrorism and trade. Pakistan even allowed NATO forces stationed in Afghanistan to launch attacks on militant groups in Pakistan. This was something strongly opposed by the previous government of Pakistan. The two states finally signed into law the long-awaited Afghanistan–Pakistan <b>Transit</b> <b>Trade</b> Agreement in 2011, intended to improve trade.|$|E
60|$|In {{the year}} 1913 Germany's imports {{amounted}} to $2,690,000,000, and her exports to $2,525,000,000, exclusive of <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> and bullion. That is to say, imports exceeded exports by about $165,000,000. On {{the average of}} the five years ending 1913, however, her imports exceeded her exports by a substantially larger amount, namely, $370,000,000. It follows, therefore, that more than the whole of Germany's pre-war balance for new foreign investment was derived from the interest on her existing foreign securities, and from the profits of her shipping, foreign banking, etc. As her foreign properties and her mercantile marine are now to be taken from her, and as her foreign banking and other miscellaneous sources of revenue from abroad have been largely destroyed, it appears that, on the pre-war basis of exports and imports, Germany, so far from having a surplus wherewith to make a foreign payment, would be not nearly self-supporting. Her first task, therefore, must be to effect a readjustment of consumption and production to cover this deficit. Any further economy she can effect in the use of imported commodities, and any further stimulation of exports will then be available for Reparation.|$|E

"Turkey-in-Asia" [...] is a {{transitory}} phenomenon, {{a sort of}} chrysalis which enshrouded {{the countries}} of Western Asia because they were exhausted and needed torpor as a preliminary to recuperation. Many calamities had fallen upon them during the five centuries before the chrysalis formed. The break-up of the Arab Caliphate of Bagdad had led to an interminable, meaningless conflict among a host of petty Moslem States; the wearing struggle between Islam and Christendom had been intensified by the Crusades; and waves of nomadic invaders, each more destructive and more irresistible than the last, had swept over Moslem Asia out of the steppes and deserts of the north-east. The most terrible were the Mongols, who sacked Bagdad in 1258, and gave the coup de grâce to the civilisation of Mesopotamia. And then, when the native productiveness of the Near East was ruined, the <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> between Europe and the Indies, which had belonged to it from the earliest times and had been the second source of its prosperity, was taken from it by the western seafarers who discovered the ocean routes.
