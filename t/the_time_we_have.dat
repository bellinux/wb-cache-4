500|$|Prime Minister Michael Manley {{expressed}} {{his determination to}} take stronger action against firearms, predicting that [...] "It {{will be a long}} war. [...] No country can win a war against crime overnight, but we shall win. [...] By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> finished with them, Jamaican gunmen will be sorry they ever heard of a thing called a gun." [...] In order to win this war, Manley believed it necessary to fully disarm the public: [...] "There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Hancock was Peter Berg's {{first film}} with visual effects as {{critical}} cinematic elements. He considered the computer-generated fight his least {{favorite part of}} the film, citing limited control in making the scene successful. According to the director, [...] "Once the fight starts, you're very limited and you're at the mercy of your effects guys... unless they're really technically oriented... it's definitely <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the least amount of control as directors." [...] He and other filmmakers worked {{to cut down on the}} fight scene, believing that the film's success would come from the character study of Smith's character, John Hancock, similar to Robert Downey, Jr.'s acclaimed portrayal of Tony Stark in the previous May's superhero release, Iron Man.|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But {{if you do it}} right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> wandered through <b>the</b> town {{and got the}} letters and found the hotel--so I went to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> Billy Dill along, {{and what he}} thought of sleeping on a train?" [...] remarked Dave, to Phil and Roger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I!" [...] said Parsley; [...] "and Sourgrass and I {{rode the}} same butterfly; but by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> come this far, we got too heavy, and Sourgrass made me get off." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1924, the Adelaide Sun wrote: [...] "The word 'stole' {{may sound}} a bit far-fetched but by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{told the story}} of the heart-broken Aboriginal mother we are sure the word will not be {{considered}} out of place." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} presidents have issued {{responses}} to these events. One of them, Presbyterian College president John Griffith, compared this movement {{to a form of}} revolution: [...] "I have lived long enough to {{come to the conclusion that}} major shifts occur every quarter century or so in the way American culture approaches matters of importance. We often call those shifts revolutions because people revolt against old and outmoded ways of doing things in favor of new approaches, new technologies and new ideas that better meet the needs of <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> experienced revolutions in information technology, travel and communication. There is one going on now that is symbolized by the introduction of iPhones this past week; we know what this one is about. But there is another revolution going on related to choosing a college -- and the role that public rankings play in that choice -- that may be less clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been running," [...] {{observed}} Mulford, [...] "I {{should think}} {{we must be}} getting near the northern side of the reef." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl: [...] "Certainly is.... 'Member <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> May {{party at}} Adelaide's, and all I could get for my basket was rag babies and May flowers? Gee, but I felt out of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>had,</b> during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been on <b>the</b> journey, abstained from {{staining}} my skin {{under my}} garments, {{in order that}} I might {{be recognized as a}} white man, as soon as I bared my arms.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{staying at}} home after that. We three lost no time in starting, for {{railways}} had become available, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> driven from <b>the</b> station at Portsmouth the Douro had been signalled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fools!" [...] he shouted, [...] "do {{you think}} that the old fox has wasted <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> given him? You may be sure that the richest prizes have been carried above." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This is delightful!” she exclaimed, as they sped on swiftly. “I {{used to go}} sailing now {{and then}} at Toronto, but all <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lived here I’ve never been on the water.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Lewis, {{here is a}} seat by me," [...] said Betty. [...] "We {{have been}} pleasantly passing <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> had bear stories, snake stories, ghost stories--all kinds of tales. Will you tell us one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got out our 'Upton's Tactics,' {{turned to}} page fifty-seven, said 'one--two--three--one--two--three' {{a couple of}} times, and got blank {{cartridges}} into our Springfields, the Spanish outfit had smiled repeatedly, rolled and lit cigarettes by squads, and walked away contemptuously.|$|R
60|$|By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> slowly {{advanced}} up {{the grand}} staircase into the banqueting-hall, {{and had made}} our reverences to the king and queen-- ah, how stately and beautiful they looked together!--the Prince had stepped in some other way, and stood beside me.|$|R
60|$|We lads {{succeeded in}} getting a good outfit, with quite as much {{ammunition}} as could be carried comfortably, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> taken our places in the line, the enemy's shots were beginning to come dangerously near some of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] {{answered}} his friend; [...] "not all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> been out walking about town, {{and we have}} had dinner here--an excellent feed, let me tell you, and cheap too. But where did you run off to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Robert, {{now that}} I am getting strong again, {{we ought to}} talk about the future. I am sure that by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> paid all we owe here, we shall not have much left out of our hundred pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Fred, {{after looking}} round and {{up at the}} sky for some time, [...] "considering <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been travelling, and the {{position}} of the sun, that the gully lies over yonder. Indeed, I feel almost sure it does." ...|$|E
60|$|Then the old {{man asked}} {{concerning}} our interview with the commodore, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{come to an end}} of our story Hog Point was so far astern that there was no longer any thought in my mind of returning.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{retained}} {{on board}} the obsolete publications and had all good intentions {{of getting rid of}} these things but had not done so at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> started <b>the</b> mission. I wanted to get the place organized eventually and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> excessive numbers of copies on board (...) ...|$|R
60|$|Just then, with {{a terrific}} yell, Job arrived {{right on the}} top of us, {{knocking}} us both down. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> struggled to our feet again Ayesha was standing among us, and bidding us light the lamps, which fortunately remained uninjured, as also did the spare jar of oil.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{take a look}} at the {{lighthouse}} first, for you have not been there yet, and it is worth seeing. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done that it will be pretty warm, and we will have lunch under the trees on the Island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are too familiar; and I can't have it! Considering the {{shortness}} of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> known each other, Mr. Smith, you {{take too much}} upon you. You think I am a country girl, and it doesn't matter how you behave to me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{that is in}} it," [...] he {{repeated}} angrily. [...] "I've never heard anybody talk like this. And {{to tell you the}} truth, sir, all <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been together I've never quite made you out. What's one ocean more than another? Charm, indeed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, when I got there, old man Sterling and his outfit {{certainly}} laid {{themselves out}} to be agreeable. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> business and pleasure so mixed up that you couldn't tell {{whether it was a}} treat or a trade half <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> trolley rides, and cigars, and theatre round-ups, and rubber parties." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{the first}} few days it became clear that {{we should be able to}} take the field with about forty {{thousand}} infantry and twenty thousand cavalry, a very respectable force considering how short was <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to collect it, and that about half the regular army had elected to follow Sorais.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{strikes the}} town after supper-time, and we concludes to sample {{whatever}} efficacy {{there is in}} this eating-house down by the railroad tracks. By <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> set down and pried up our plates with a knife from the red oil-cloth, along intrudes Widow Jessup with the hot biscuit and the fried liver.|$|R
6000|$|... "It would indeed. Well, we {{will feed}} our horses at once, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had {{a cup of}} tea they will be ready to start. If we have luck, we ought not to be away {{more than a couple of}} hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Turn me adrift!" [...] {{deliberately}} repeated Fid, [...] "that {{would be}} cutting all your weather lanyards at one blow, master Harry. Little good would come of Scipio Africa and you, after I should part company. Have you ever fairly logg'd <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sailed together?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{imagine that}} you can have eaten nothing today, Mr. Lindsay. I am about to take tiffin, and bid you do so with me. I shall at once send to members of the Council and, by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{finished}} our meal, they will no doubt be here." ...|$|E
50|$|For <b>the</b> first <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a {{complete}} archaeological picture of wine production dating back 6,100 years.|$|R
5000|$|Me, Mark Lanegan, Josh Hommeand Hutch, our soundman, {{have the}} same tattoo, it's from Rock am Ring festival. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to play was 4.15 in the {{afternoon}} {{and it was just a}} terrible show. It sucked, it was horrible. That's why I tattooed it on my ribs, where it would hurt, so I'd never forget. Oliveri, interview with Daredevil Magazine (2005) ...|$|R
60|$|I said yes, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> soaked {{ourselves}} in a whole shilling's worth of beer, and slept the night on a miserable bed in a miserable den, I knew him pretty fairly for what he was.
