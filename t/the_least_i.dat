500|$|The {{first week}} of {{recording}} produced [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. I thought we were playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making <b>the</b> <b>least...</b> <b>I</b> just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Udwin {{has said}} it was the protests in {{response}} to the rape that drew her to make this film. [...] "I was absolutely awestruck by the ordinary men and women of India who poured out onto the streets in response to this horrific gang rape and who demanded change for women's rights. And I thought <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> could do was amplify their voices." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2001, Markhasev sent {{a letter}} to California Deputy Attorney General Kyle Brodie asking that all appeals in his case stop. Markhasev wrote to Brodie that he had killed Cosby and that he wanted {{to do the right thing}} by confessing. [...] "Although my appeal is in its {{beginning}} stages, I don't want to continue with it because it's based on falsehood and deceit," [...] wrote Markhasev, who is incarcerated at California State Prison, Corcoran. [...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right thing ... More than anything, I want to apologize to the victim's family. It is my duty as a Christian, and it's <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can do, after the great wickedness for which I am responsible." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson {{regarding}} Alabama, that [...] "I am {{attempting to}} do <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> can do safely without upsetting the civil rights groups." [...] Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the [...] "high-visibility" [...] election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists. With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office. Clark later was prosecuted and convicted of drug smuggling and served a prison sentence. The US Civil Rights Commission said that the murders of activists, such as Jonathan Daniels in 1965, had been a major impediment to voter registration.|$|E
