40|$|We have {{previously}} found a temperature-dependent upflow in <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region following a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed by the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). In this paper, we reanalyzed the observations along with previous {{work on this}} event, and provided boundary conditions for modeling. We found that the intensity in <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region dramatically drops within 30 minutes from the flare onset, and <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region reaches <b>the</b> equilibrium stage after ∼ 1 hour later. The temperature-dependent upflows were observed during the equilibrium stage by EIS. The cross sectional area of the fluxtube in <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region {{does not appear to}} expand significantly. From the observational constraints, we reconstructed the temperature-dependent upflow by using a new method which considers the mass and momentum conservation law, and demonstrated the height variation of plasma conditions in <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> region. We found that a super radial expansion of the cross sectional area is required to satisfy the mass conservation and momentum equations. There is a steep temperature and velocity gradient of around 7 Mm from the solar surface.

40|$|We find {{transient}} transit-like <b>dimming</b> events within <b>the</b> K 2 {{time series}} photometry {{of the young}} star RIK- 210 in the Upper Scorpius OB association. These dimming events are variable in depth, duration, and morphology. High spatial resolution imaging revealed that the star is single and radial velocity monitoring indicated that <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> events cannot be due to an eclipsing stellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> events suggests they are not due to a single spherical body. The ingress of each dimming event is always shallower than egress, {{as one would expect}} for an orbiting body with a leading tail. <b>The</b> <b>dimming</b> events are periodic and synchronous with the stellar rotation. However, we argue it is unlikely <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> events could be attributed to anything on the stellar surface based on the observed depths and durations. Variable obscuration by a protoplanetary disk is unlikely on the basis that the star is not actively accreting and lacks the infrared excess associated with an inner disk. Rather, we explore the possibilities that <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> events are due to magnetospheric clouds, a transiting protoplanet surrounded by circumplanetary dust and debris, eccentric orbiting bodies undergoing periodic tidal disruption, or an extended field of dust or debris near the corotation radius.

5|$|In {{addition}} to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits synchrotron radiation (also {{known as the}} Jovian decimetric radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies {{in the range of}} 0.1–15GHz (wavelength from 3m to 2cm), which is the bremsstrahlung radiation of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the image of the comuneros began to be rehabilitated by scholars such as Manuel Quintana as precursors of freedom and martyrs against absolutism. [...] The decline of Castilian liberty was linked to the later decline of Spain. [...] The first major commemorative event came in 1821, the third [...] of the Battle of Villalar. [...] Juan Martín Díez, a nationalistic liberal military leader who had fought in the resistance against Napoleon, led an expedition to find and exhume the remains of the three leaders executed in 1521. [...] Díez praised the comuneros on behalf of the liberal government in power at the time, likely the first positive governmental recognition for their cause. [...] This view was challenged by conservatives who viewed a centralized state as modern and progressive, especially after the anarchy and fragmentation of the 1868 Revolution in Spain. [...] Manuel Danvila, a conservative government minister, published the six-volume Historia critica y documentada de las Comunidades de Castilla from 1897–1900, {{one of the most important}} works of scholarship on the revolt. [...] Drawing on collected original sources, Danvila emphasized the fiscal demands of the comuneros, and cast them as traditionalist, reactionary, medieval, and feudal. [...] Though a liberal, intellectual Gregorio Marañón shared <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> view of the comuneros that again prevailed in Spain; he cast the conflict as one between a modern, progressive state open to beneficent foreign influence against a conservative, reactionary, and xenophobic Spain hypersensitive to religious and cultural deviance with an insistence on spurious racial purity.|$|E

He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing <b>the</b> <b>dim,</b> far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving.

500|$|Fargnoli and Gillespie {{suggest that}} the book's opening chapter [...] "introduces [...] major themes and {{concerns}} of the book", and enumerate these as [...] "Finnegan's fall, the promise of his resurrection, the cyclical structure of time and history (dissolution and renewal), tragic love as embodied {{in the story of}} Tristan and Iseult, the motif of the warring brothers, the personification of the landscape and the question of Earwicker's crime in the park, the precise nature of which is left uncertain throughout the Wake." [...] Such a view finds general critical consensus, viewing the vignettes as allegorical appropriations of the book's characters and themes; for example, Schwartz argues that [...] "The Willingdone Museyroom" [...] episode represents the book's [...] "archetypal family drama in military-historical terms." [...] Joyce himself referred to the chapter as a [...] "prelude", and as an [...] "air photograph of Irish history, a celebration of <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> past of Dublin." [...] Riquelme finds that [...] "passages near the book's beginning and its ending echo and complement one another", and Fargnoli and Gillespie representatively argue that the book's cyclical structure echoes the themes inherent within, that [...] "the typologies of human experience that Joyce identifies [...] are [...] essentially cyclical, that is, patterned and recurrent; in particular, the experiences of birth, guilt, judgment, sexuality, family, social ritual and death recur throughout the Wake. In a similar enumeration of themes, Tindall argues that [...] "rise and fall and rise again, sleeping and waking, death and resurrection, sin and redemption, conflict and appeasement, and, above all, time itself [...] are the matter of Joyce's essay on man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot {{primarily}} in the anamorphic format on 35mm film, with key sequences filmed on 65mm, and aerial sequences in VistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with The Dark Knight. [...] "We didn't feel {{that we were going}} to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly". In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using Showscan and Super Dimension 70 as potential large format high frame rate camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format. Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. [...] "Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie." [...] Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film using prime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras. Nolan has also criticized <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception, saying [...] "I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading." [...] Nolan did test converting Inception into 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with. In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu-ray release.|$|E
