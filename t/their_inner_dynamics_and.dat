By means of a qualitative interview study we investigated structures and strategies of power within virtual networks. Results show that micro-political tactics known from research in traditional organizations are also used in inter-organizational settings.

My Thesis addresses this problem by taking an evolutionary approach. I analysed in detail the many and different observational evidences of a discrepancy the predicted halo equilibrium state and the one inferred from the measurable properties of disk galaxies, {{as well as of the}} scaling relations existing between the angular momentum, geometry and mass distribution of the luminous and dark components, and realized that they all seem to point towards the same conclusion: the baryons hosted inside the halo, by collapsing and assembling to form the galaxy, perturb the halo equilibrium structure and made it evolve into new configurations. From the theoretical point of view, the behaviour {{of dark matter}} halos as collisionless systems of particles makes their equilibrium structure and mass distribution extremely sensitive to perturbations of <b>their</b> <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics.</b> The galaxy formation occurring inside the halos is a tremendous event, and the dynamical coupling between the baryons and the dark matter during the protogalaxy collapse represents a perturbation of the halo dynamical structure large enough to trigger a halo evolution, according to the relative mass and angular momentum of the two components. My conclusion is that the structure <b>and</b> <b>dynamics</b> of dark matter halos, as well as the origin of the connection between the halo and galaxy properties, are to be understood in in terms of a joint evolution of the baryonic and dark components, originating at the epoch of the collapse and formation of the galaxy.

Recent literature on global historiography shows a growing, but still inadequate {{recognition of the}} crucial role played by “contacts between civilizations in space”, i. e. cultural interaction, in A. Toynbee's rethinking of the Spenglerian notion of Weltgeschichte {{as a series of}} unrelated life cycles of high cultures. His study of civilizations, while pursuing a comparative assessment of the laws regulating <b>their</b> <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> (nomothetic approach), was also heavily indebted to the ancient model of narrative treatment of universal history embodied in the works of Eduard Meyer, who depicted the history of antiquity as a process of gradual unification of the Mediterranean world through the spreading and thickening of the web connecting state-systems and cultural areas formerly living in isolation (oecumenical approach). Toynbee's accounts of Mediterranean history largely concentrated on world-historical outcomes of ancient and modern encounters between East and West, such as the birth and cross-cultural diffusion of higher religions, providing his overall vision of the evolution of humanity with a major unifying thread. Focusing on Toynbee's analysis of interactions between civilizations of the second and third generation taking place in the Mediterranean basin, as recorded not only in his magnum opus but also in his more specialized historical works, the paper aims both to offer a critical evaluation of his theory of the cultural contact and to locate the specific function given to the Mediterranean experience in his philosophy of history...|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, delay {{differential}} equations (DDEs) are {{a type of}} differential equation in which the derivative of the unknown function {{at a certain time}} is given in terms of the values of the function at previous times.DDEs are also called time-delay systems, systems with aftereffect or dead-time, hereditary systems, equations with deviating argument, or differential-difference equations. They belong to the class of systems with the functional state, i.e. partial {{differential equations}} (PDEs) which are infinite dimensional, as opposed to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) having a finite dimensional state vector. Four points may give a possible explanation of the popularity of DDEs. (1) Aftereffect is an applied problem: it is well known that, together with the increasing expectations of dynamic performances, engineers need their models to behave more like the real process. Many processes include aftereffect phenomena in <b>their</b> <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics.</b> In addition, actuators, sensors, communication networks that are now involved in feedback control loops introduce such delays. Finally, besides actual delays, time lags are frequently used to simplify very high order models. Then, the interest for DDEs keeps on growing in all scientific areas and, especially, in control engineering. (2) Delay systems are still resistant to many classical controllers: one could think that the simplest approach would consist in replacing them by some finite-dimensional approximations. Unfortunately, ignoring effects which are adequately represented by DDEs is not a general alternative: in the best situation (constant and known delays), it leads to the same degree of complexity in the control design. In worst cases (time-varying delays, for instance), it is potentially disastrous in terms of stability and oscillations. (3) Delay properties are also surprising since several studies have shown that voluntary introduction of delays can also benefit the control. (4) In spite of their complexity, DDEs however often appear as simple infinite-dimensional models in the very complex area of partial differential equations (PDEs).|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper was to study managers’ understanding concerning the role of management team work in specialized health care, as well as management team work methods within the different activity areas in a hospital and in the operational units within their domain. A total of 54 interviews of activity area managers and operational unit managers in one Finnish hospital district in 2007 - 2008 was analyzed using data-driven content analysis. Work of all management teams focused on financial and operative issues. However, different management teams used different working methods, which implicates the existence of medical specialization-specific work subcultures within a shared organizational culture. The psychiatric activity area appeared the most active and the most future-oriented, whereas the activity area of operative specializations seemed the most defensive, and the activity area of conservative specializations was businesslike and unfocused as regards the future. These differences were portrayed in the teams’ <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> interaction practices. Activity area work methods did not directly transfer to those of the unit-level management teams. We conclude that management teams may not be optimally used as a forum for strategic issues or innovation throughout hospital organizations and more research is needed in order to better understand the connections between management team work, organizational culture and medical specialization culture.

A dense configuration of borehole seismograms with high SNR observations of PKiKP waves over an unusually broad range of frequencies facilitates this new approach to estimate ICB properties.

40|$|Inspired on {{the well}} known {{dynamical}} dichotomy predicted in voids, where some underdense regions expand whereas others collapse due to overdense surrounding regions, we explored {{the interplay between}} the void <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> its large scale environment. The environment is classified depending on its density as in previous works. We analyse the dynamical properties of void-centered spherical shells at different void-centric distances depending on this classification. The above dynamical properties are given by the angular distribution of the radial velocity field, its smoothness, the field dependence on the tracer density and shape, and the field departures from linear theory. We found that the velocity field in expanding voids follows more closely the linear prediction, with a more smooth velocity field. However when using velocity tracers with large densities such deviations increase. Voids with sizes around 18 h^- 1 Mpc are in a transition regime between regions with expansion overpredicted and underpredicted from linear theory. We also found that velocity smoothness increases as the void radius, indicating the laminar flow dominates the expansion of larger voids (more than 18 h^- 1 Mpc). The correlations observed suggest that nonlinear <b>dynamics</b> of the <b>inner</b> regions of voids could be dependent {{on the evolution of}} the surrounding structures. These also indicate possible scale couplings between the void inner expansion and the large scale regions where voids are embedded. These results shed some light to the origin of nonlinearities in voids, going beyond the fact that voids just quickly becomes nonlinear as they become emptier.

40|$|Operational {{excellence}} is an executional competency {{that reflects}} a firm’s {{ability to run}} its day-to-day operations efficiently, effectively, and profitably. Differing views have been expressed regarding the <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> value creation potential of operational excellence. From an <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> perspective, the competency’s dimensions of efficiency and effectiveness are viewed by some as conflicting and difficult to reconcile (the tradeoff model), and by others as synergistic and mutually supportive (the cumulative model). From a value creation perspective, operational excellence is portrayed by some as an effective cash-flow generator and a potent enabler of firm growth, and by others {{as a source of}} excessive routinization that hinders strategic adaptation and limits long-term value creation. The present dissertation revisits these conflicting views. Drawing on Porter’s profit maximization prescription, essay 1 empirically examines the individual and collective effects of operational efficiency and operational effectiveness on firm profitability. In so doing, it assesses the respective merits of the tradeoff and cumulative perspectives. Empirical findings based on a multi-industry panel of 595 public US manufacturing firms provide relative support for the cumulative perspective; concurrent improvements in efficiency and effectiveness are shown to have a compounding positive effect on firm profitability. The findings also show that the individual benefits of isolated improvements to either efficiency or effectiveness tend to be curvilinear with diminishing returns. Addressing the value creation question, essay 2 draws on signaling theory to empirically examine the stock market’s ex-ante assessment of operational excellence as an instrument for long-term value creation. Contrary to the productivity dilemma narrative, empirical results show that market participants tend to have a positive outlook on the value creation potential of operational excellence. The positive outlook is, however, found to be dampened by the stock market’s expectations of firm short-term revenue growth and amplified by firm R 2 ̆ 6 D efforts. In a third exploratory essay, I discuss environmental and organizational learning factors that have the potential to cause firms to grow over-invested in operational excellence at the expense of strategic foresight and market adaptation.

30|$|The {{preference}} for complexity reduction {{is related to}} the perspective, called the “objective realist perspective”, which means that “the social world is made of things in which processes represent the change in things” (Van de Ven & Poole, 2005, p. 1380). From a complexity science perspective, the world is {{in a constant state of}} movement and becoming. They are what is called in complexity theory “dissipative structures”(Herfel et al., 2007) dependent on the flow of their existence, yet paradoxically they are entities in their own right insofar as <b>their</b> <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> can be studied independent of the constituting flow. A very powerful affinity is seen with the idea of the relationship between organizations and their environment, of departments and individuals within that organization; each is at a different level of description in the nested hierarchy that is the organization. Failure to recognize this means that managers assume they are outside the very processes that constitute the organization’s existence, thus able to operate independently, free from the constraining effects of the culture, rules and practices on which they depend. From a process or complexity perspective, it is these ingredients that actually constitute them as managers. This means that managers believe they are able to make independent decisions that are outside the flow of events that shape the organization (Van de Ven & Poole, 1995, 2005). However, these dynamics whilst being intrinsic to the entity being studied i.e., the individual and the department are entirely dependent on the context in which these entities exist. Similarly, for the organization the same sub-processes apply from the organizational context to the individual in the organization. By extension it is natural to see that a living organism is not a separate entity existing independently; instead, it is simply an identifiable pattern constituted by the flows that sustain it; thus we can say that organizations and the organisms that have constituted it are also dissipative structures. In the case of an organization, the flow of energy is also a flow of information that sustains the organization’s internal structures and maintains its internal processes.|$|R

In order to learn from the program 2 ̆ 7 s path to success, this research investigated the <b>inner</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> leadership actions related to the development of Biomedical Graduate Studies (BGS) at the University of Pennsylvania. The retrospective instrumental case study explored the process from the period prior to the establishment of the program in 1984 until its current configuration in 2014. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 18 people representing different time periods and leadership positions in the history of the program, as well as archival material. The data were analyzed to establish the chronology of events and to identify the main themes and leadership actions of the change process. The presented case was subsequently analyzed in light of established theory on organizational change and leadership orientations in higher education. This analysis demonstrated that the change was a multi-dimensional process and could be explained by several theoretical frameworks. There were elements of planning and decisive management, organizational learning, political bargaining, adaptation to environmental factors, and attention to culture and symbolism. The process involved a transformation that empowered the junior faculty, promoted collegiality, and improved the quality of recruitment, student satisfaction, and scientific outcomes. Centralization of student recruitment and funding, detaching the graduate education from the department structure, and collaborative leadership stood out as primary factors for success. This case study may serve as a guideline for other institutions that aim to develop centralized biomedical graduate programs. It also represents a reference for further research in the field of biomedical education management. ...|$|R
