5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the <b>third</b> <b>row</b> with Mark Webber, who {{did not seem to be}} suffering the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E
5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the <b>third</b> <b>row,</b> while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week at Kansas Speedway, Foyt and his teammate Ed Carpenter shared the <b>third</b> <b>row,</b> with Foyt qualifying 5th. It {{was his best}} career start and second top-10 start in a row. In the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300, Foyt had his chances of a high finish end as his car {{was caught in the}} pits when an accident involving Buddy Rice occurred. Foyt would drive to an eighth-place finish. Foyt's best finish of the season came in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 in June at the Iowa Speedway where he finished fifth. Foyt finished 19th in points.|$|E

5|$|The top six {{drivers were}} split evenly by engine; half running Honda engines, {{and the other}} half Chevrolet. It was also {{the first time in the}} 2012 season that six {{different}} teams were represented in the third qualifying round. Hunter-Reay and Power traded fastest times early in the session before Pagenaud and Viso went quicker. Power and Dixon then set times under 71 seconds, and then improved upon their own laps to finish as the top-two. Dixon set the fastest time; 1:10.3162: just four thousandths of a second quicker than Power. Tagliani was third, joined on the second row by Pagenaud, while Viso and Hunter-Reay qualified on the <b>third</b> <b>row</b> of the grid. Rahal and Simona de Silvestro were both subject to ten-place grid penalties for engine changes made in mid-May, dropping them to 17th and 25th on the grid respectively. Rubens Barrichello was also given a ten-place penalty for changing his chassis between qualifying and the race, placing him 24th.|$|E
5|$|The top ten drivers {{competed for}} pole {{position}} in Q3 {{and it was}} a battle between the two Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton set his fastest time first with Rosberg right behind him. A much better time in the third sector of the track allowed Rosberg to take his sixth consecutive pole position almost four-tenths ahead of his teammate. Sergio Pérez held third spot for much of the session but was beaten to it by Kimi Räikkönen during the second turn of runs. The two were followed by Daniel Ricciardo and Valtteri Bottas on the <b>third</b> <b>row</b> of the grid. Following a gearbox change after qualifying, Romain Grosjean was demoted five places on the grid. Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens also received five place penalties: Stevens for a change of the Control Electronics unit, Merhi for changes made to his suspension. Both would start the race from the back row of the grid.|$|E
5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. Qualifying {{was divided}} into two groups of thirteen cars, with the odd numbered vehicles in Group A and the even numbered cars in Group B. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Light rain fell as the session started with some drivers electing to equip the super soft tyres to their cars while other competitors chose to utilise wet-weather compounds. Rossi clinched the second pole position of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 37.019 seconds. The achievement ended Vandoorne's run of consecutive pole positions which started at the 2014 Spa-Francorchamps round. He was joined on the grid's front row by Marciello who was three-tenths of a second off Rossi's pace and had the pole until the latter's lap. Marciello pushed hard and narrowly avoided losing control of his car at Massenet's barriers. Pic qualified third and Vandoorne was fourth. Sergey Sirotkin improved his lap time late in the qualifying period to start from fifth place. He shared the <b>third</b> <b>row</b> with Julián Leal who was ahead of Nick Yelloly and Jordan King. Canamasas and de Jong completed the top ten qualifiers; de Jong slid into the Mirabeau barrier in the closing minutes of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups lasting 25 minutes each. Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each and the starting order was determined by the competitor's fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The session started on a wet track but dried out as it progressed. André Lotterer and Marcel Fässler in the No. 7 Audi clinched the vehicle's first pole position of the season, and the team's first since the 2013 6 Hours of Fuji, with an average lap time of one minute and 53.204 seconds. Manor's No. 44 car made contact with Fässler {{at the end of the}} session but both vehicles sustained no apparent damage. It also ended Porsche's streak of 11 consecutive pole positions, extending back to the 2014 6 Hours of Shanghai. They were joined on the grid's front row by the team's No. 8 sister entry. Di Grassi recorded the fastest qualifying timed lap late in the session but went off the track heading into Vale corner while attempting to go faster. He went into the turn's gravel trap, preventing him from achieving the pole position. The two Porsche cars were third and fourth (the No. 1 vehicle in front of the No. 2 entry). Hartley was delayed by slower traffic on his final timed lap and believed he could have improved on his time. Toyota's entrants had unsuitable car control settings and a different vehicle set-up, restricting to them to qualifying on the grid's <b>third</b> <b>row</b> (their No. 5 car ahead of the No. 6 entry). Oliver Webb and Rossiter in the ByKolles Racing CLM P1/01 and the two Rebellion Racing cars rounded out the LMP1 field; Rebellion elected not to record any lap times.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his eighth pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, in a time of 1:35.825. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen, who was nine thousands of a second slower than his championship rival and battled him for grid position throughout the session. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified third, and conceded that he was not quick enough to challenge for pole position. The two Williams drivers qualified on the <b>third</b> <b>row</b> of the grid; Button ahead of Ralf Schumacher although both drivers had mixed feelings over their performance. Both Jaguar drivers took seventh and tenth and were satisifed with their pace. Frentzen reported that his car was difficult to handle but was happy to manage an qualifying position of eighth. Villeneuve took ninth despite suffering from excessive oversteer and was unable to improve his time because he changed his car in the opposite direction. Herbert who rounded out the top ten felt he could have qualified on the fourth row despite changes to his set-up. Wurz qualified eleventh and missed on qualifying in the top ten by nearly two thousands of a second. His teammate Fisichella started from twelfth position and reported his car lost performance after the morning practice sessions. Both Arrows drivers filled the seventh row of the grid–de la Rosa was faster than Verstappen–and were affected with problems on the cars limiting their running. Trulli had car handling issues and qualified 15th. Heidfeld qualified 16th, ahead of teammate Jean Alesi. Zonta had limited qualifying time because of an engine change and managed 18th overall. The tenth row of the grid was filled by both Sauber drivers; Mika Salo in front of Pedro Diniz. Salo used the spare Sauber because his race car had alternator issues. Both of Diniz's two fastest qualifying times were disallowed because of him laying oil on the circuit in the morning practice sessions. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid with Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E

Japanese manufacture of the sedan occurred soon after, coming to the market in November 1992. From November 1993, Toyota began importing the coupe model from the United States. Scepters were phased out in 1996, starting with the coupe (April), wagon (June), and sedan (December). The large and spacious wagon, when fitted with <b>third</b> <b>row</b> seating that stowed away under the cargo floor could accommodate seven passengers. All three body variants were available with either the 2.2- and 3.0-liter engines.|$|E

25|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for 18 minutes, eliminating cars that finished the session 17th or below. The 107% rule was in effect, requiring drivers to reach a time within 107% of the quickest lap to qualify. The {{second part of the}} qualifying session lasted 15 minutes, eliminating cars that finished 11th to 16th. The final part of the qualifying session determined the positions from first to tenth, deciding the pole position. Cars in the final qualifying session were not allowed to change tyres, using the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. Qualifying took place in warm weather conditions. Hamilton set the fastest laps in all three sessions to clinch his fifth pole position of the season, the 36th of his career, and his first since the Spanish Grand Prix with a time of one minute and 24.109 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosberg (running with a repaired gearbox) who recorded a lap 0.274 seconds slower than his teammate having improved on his first timed lap, but oversteered through the Ascari chicane, preventing him from achieving the pole position. The two Williams cars lined up in third and fourth (with Bottas ahead of Massa) and both drivers were unable to improve their fastest times on their second attempts. They were ahead of both McLaren drivers on the grid's <b>third</b> <b>row</b> with Magnussen faster than teammate Button; the latter lost time through the Lesmo corners on his final timed lap. Alonso was slightly slower than Vettel after his first run on the circuit, but improved slightly to secure seventh. He attributed his starting position to recording similar lap times on four sets of tyres used during qualifying. Vettel out-qualified teammate Ricciardo for the fourth time in the past six races to secure eighth with Ricicardo starting ninth. Pérez rounded out the top-ten qualifiers.|$|E
