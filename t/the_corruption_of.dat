5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist. His satirical works, {{inspired}} by {{the philosophy of the}} Age of Enlightenment, were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} {{commented on the}} recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
5|$|The new tolls {{cause the}} price of food and other {{essentials}} to rise, enriching both Süß and the Duke. Süß gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus engaging in <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> their morals. The increase in {{the price of}} basic necessities causes the people of Württemberg to suffer great privation.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{pamphlet}} describes the pitiable and desperate {{conditions in which}} prostitutes lived, and <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the police supposed to be patrol them, it also accuses prostitutes of 'Inhumanity' and deems them devilish and monstrous. The vices of the prostitute are presented as those endemic among all women.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the health system and feeling {{that he could not}} fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|As {{a patron}} James V {{supported}} poets William Stewart and John Bellenden. Stewart produced a verse {{version of the}} Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Boece and Bellenden produced a prose translation of Livy's History of Rome in 1533. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon, {{the head of the}} Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He produced an interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> church and state, making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda.|$|E

5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of good citizens instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the colonial authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{while they}} were still dating, Achebe {{dedicated}} to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Aparts main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, he co-starred in Scarecrow, with Gene Hackman, {{and won the}} Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in the sequel The Godfather Part II, which was the first sequel to win the Best Picture Oscar; Pacino, meanwhile, {{was nominated}} for his third Oscar.|$|E

5|$|Orr's first {{professional}} contract {{was one of}} the first in professional ice hockey to be negotiated by an agent. It made him the highest-paid player in NHL history as a rookie. His second contract was the first million-dollar contract in the NHL. However, after his retirement, Orr learned he was deeply in debt and he had to sell off most of what he owned. Orr broke with his agent Alan Eagleson and sued the Black Hawks to settle his contract. Orr and his family returned to Boston where Orr went into business to rebuild his finances. Orr aided the investigations that led to Eagleson's fraud convictions and disbarment. Orr also supported the lawsuit that exposed <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the NHL's pension plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{sources for}} the history of Parthia and the wars with Rome are scant and scattered. The Parthians {{followed}} the Achaemenid tradition and favored oral historiography, which assured <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> their history once they had been vanquished. The main sources of this period are thus Roman (Tacitus, Marius Maximus, and Justin) and Greek historians (Herodian, Cassius Dio and Plutarch). The 13th book of the Sibylline Oracles narrates the effects of the RomanPersian Wars in Syria from the reign of Gordian III to the domination of the province by Odaenathus of Palmyra. With the end of Herodian's record, all contemporary chronological narratives of Roman history are lost, until the narratives of Lactantius and Eusebius {{at the beginning of the}} 4th century, both from a Christian perspective.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly into the Bank of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> Latin American countries. Latin America is {{a region}} {{with a severe}} problem <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> {{but there are also}} countries in the region that diverge by having a relatively low level <b>of</b> <b>corruption.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to examine}} which factors can explain the differences in <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> region. On the basis of a number of theories and previous research regarding <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> <b>corruption,</b> this study examines which effects democratization, the stability of democracy, decentralization, state intervention and social capital have on <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> Latin American countries. A quantitative method with simple linear regressions was used to find out if there are any significant linear relationships between these variables and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> the study show a significant negative relationship between democratization and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in <b>the</b> Latin American countries. Countries with a more developed democracy tend to have lower levels <b>of</b> <b>corruption.</b> <b>The</b> other variables can not significantly explain the variance in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>corruption</b> in Latin America. 2008 - 06 - 05 </p...|$|R

5|$|Lyndsay {{produced}} an interlude at Linlithgow Palace {{for the king}} and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.|$|E
5|$|Ray's {{last three}} films, made after his {{recovery}} and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, {{and have a}} distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the famous Ibsen play, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film Shakha Proshakha (Branches of the Tree). In it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, Agantuk (The Stranger), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting a new revolutionary {{era in the}} European history {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, the authors expressed sharp social criticism, castigating <b>the</b> <b>corruption</b> <b>of</b> the church authorities, the idleness of the monasticism, and popular superstition. They also appealed for reform of the language, education, and change to the social mores as a way to overcome backwardness and to renew people's mentality with a more western view. They claimed that Greece is positioned within a Europe defined by the dynamics of political reforms from old and corrupt monarchical regimes to new republican communities. The modern innovative spirit of Geographia Neoteriki was also expressed in the use of a lively and malleable vernacular (Demotic) language with very few ties to the katharevousa, a more archaich form of Greek, which was commonly used by most Greek scholars of that time.|$|E
